time-barred</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I begin by noting that the Applicant had sought to recover maintenance arrears of about 10½ years (in MSS 160) and about eight years (in MSS 1057).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       According to s 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Maintenance arrears are not recoverable in any proceedings ... from the defaulter if the amount accrued due <em>more than 3 years</em> before the commencement of the proceedings, unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    other proceedings to recover the amount from the defaulter had previously been commenced within 3 years (or any longer period that the court in those proceedings may have allowed) after the amount accrued due; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For the avoidance of doubt, I find that despite seeking to recover maintenance arrears of more than three years before the commencement of these proceedings, MSS 160 and MSS 1057 are not time-barred. I say this because the Applicant had applied to enforce the relevant maintenance order way before the time-bar kicked in: s 91R(4)(a). Arising from these applications, warrants to arrest were issued in 2017 and 2020 against the Respondent for failing to attend court for these proceedings. Since 2020, the Applicant had been checking with the authorities annually on the status of her enforcement applications. MSS 160 and MSS 1057 were commenced after she had been given a positive response after her visit to the Warrant Enforcement Unit at the Cantonment Police Complex in 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Declaration of amount of arrears</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Respondent accepted that he had failed to pay maintenance, and did not dispute the Applicant’s quantification of the arrears in MSS 160 and MSS 1057. Accordingly, pursuant to s 81(2)(a) of the Charter, I find that the applicable maintenance orders have been breached, and declare that the amount of arrears as at the date of this judgement to be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.52150430086017%\"><col width=\"59.7919583916783%\"><col width=\"32.6865373074615%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Applicable maintenance orders</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Maintenance arrears</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Originating Summons No. 44535 (xxx)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$20,750</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Maintenance Order No. VO 206/xxx</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$54,480</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Mode of enforcement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Applicant requested that the Respondent’s earnings to be attached to enforce the applicable maintenance orders. The latter did not object to this request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my view, it is appropriate to make an attachment of earnings order in this case. <em>First</em>, the Respondent is gainfully employed and is receiving regular earnings. <em>Second</em>, the identity of his employer is clear. <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent has a long history of defaulting on maintenance payments. (For a discussion of the relevant considerations for imposing an attachment of earnings order, see <em>XFB v XFC</em> [2024] SGFC 100 at [14].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Amount of earnings to attach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Although the parties agreed that there be an attachment of earnings order, they disagreed on the amount of earnings to attach. The Respondent proposed that the sum of $1,200/month. The Applicant requested that $1,500/month be attached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What are the relevant considerations for determining the amount of the earnings to attach? To answer this issue, the starting point is s 91C of the Charter. According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The amount that the court may order in an attachment of earnings order is a sum that seems <em>reasonable</em> to the court, after taking into account the resources and needs <em>of the respondent</em> and the needs <em>of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I make a few observations regarding s 91C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The provision requires a court to consider the following factors when determining the appropriate amount to attach:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The respondent’s resources,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       His personal expenses, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]he needs of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding (iii) above, it appears from the phrase “persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide” that the class of persons coming within s 91C is restricted to the respondent’s dependants.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When a respondent claims that he needs to cover the expenses of his/her dependants, it is necessary to scrutinise such claims carefully. This is because the efficacy of attachment of earnings orders can be undermined if respondents can easily avoid them by making bare claims that they have insufficient earnings for attachment due to their financial commitments to other persons. The relevant inquiries can include the following: Is the dependant gainfully employed? What is the dependant’s earning capacity? Does the dependant have other sources of income apart from the respondent? Are the dependant’s expenses – for which the respondent is providing – reasonable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, in determining what is a “reasonable” amount of earnings to attach, it is necessary to <em>balance</em> three competing interests – those of (i) the party seeking to enforce a maintenance order, (ii) the respondent, and (iii) his/her dependants. One consequence of this balancing exercise is that the amount of earnings that is eventually attached may be lower than the amount of maintenance sought to be recovered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">MEO report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having set out the relevant considerations for determining the amount of the earnings to attach, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In undertaking this determination, I am greatly assisted by the maintenance enforcement officer’s report (dated 8 May 2025) (“<b>Report</b>”).

According to him, he gives an allowance of $250 to $300 per month to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When questioned by the Applicant as to why he chose to give allowance to his mother but not a single cent to their children, the Respondent gave two reasons. <em>First</em>, his mother had given birth to him. <em>Second</em>, he claimed that the Applicant had prevented him from seeing the children unless he paid maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I cannot accept the Respondent’s reasons as amounting to sufficient cause for breaching the maintenance orders. It bears highlighting that he has the burden to show sufficient cause. In this regard –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Even if the Applicant had disallowed the Respondent from seeing their children unless he paid maintenance, this does not justify his refusal to pay child maintenance. This is because as their parent, he has both a legal and moral duty to maintain them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the Respondent has failed to provide evidence (i) on what his mother’s monthly expenses are, and (ii) why his allowance of $250 to $300 is necessary to tide her over every month. The Respondent has thus failed to explain why he cannot give a lesser amount of allowance to his mother – so that he could give the balance to his children with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, it bears noting that the Respondent has three siblings whom his mother can turn to for financial support. (On the other hand, the Applicant had to support three young children on her own for the past eight years.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Given the above, I find that the Respondent can reduce his monthly allowance to his mother to $100 – so that the balance $150 to $200 can be given to his children with the Applicant for their maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s son with the current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     According to the Respondent, he pays $345/month towards the maintenance of his one-year-old child with his current wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This amount is used to pay for the child’s diapers ($65/month) and milk powder ($280/month).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I find these expenses to be reasonable and accordingly deduct them from the Respondent’s disposal income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s stepson</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Respondent currently pays a total of $279/month towards the maintenance of his current wife’s son with another man. This consists of (a) the child’s handphone bill ($29/month), (b) his school transport ($50), and (c) school allowance ($200).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     During the trial, I could sense the Applicant’s bitterness when she asked the Respondent why he was maintaining the child of another man when he had not been maintaining their own children. The Respondent did not give an adequate response to this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I note that it is not necessary <em>at this moment</em> for the Respondent to reduce his financial support to his stepson to pay the maintenance for his children with the Applicant. This is because there is sufficient balance from his monthly disposal income to support both his stepson and the Applicant’s children: see [26] below. Accordingly, I allowed $279/month to be deducted from his disposable income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Finally, the Respondent pays for his current wife’s phone bill at $35/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He explained that his wife – who was an infant-care teacher – is now a homemaker taking care of their one-year-old child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given that the wife is currently unemployed, and the small amount involved ($35/month), I find it appropriate to deduct this amount from the Respondent’s disposal income.

His ex-Wife (“XNZ”) is the respondent. This was the essence of XNY’s complaint: that despite his attempts to move on in life after the divorce, XNZ had engaged in a pattern of conduct that caused him no small amount of stress and grief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 7 May 2025 and allowed the XNY’s application in SSP 374. In addition to ordering the PPO sought, I also made a no contact order (“NCO”) and called for a preliminary assessment report (“PAR”) (see s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The New Family Violence Regime </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is useful, at this juncture, to briefly canvass the new family violence provisions that came into force on 2 January 2025. These legislative amendments came in the wake of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Family Violence (the “Taskforce Report”) and were meant to strengthen legislation to “better protect survivors and enhance the rehabilitation and accountability of perpetrators”: Second Reading of the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and other Matters) (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2023) vol 95) (Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling) (“Second Reading”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The most significant of these amendments comes in the form of the updated definitions of family violence. The previous definition of family violence had four limbs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under the new legislative architecture, family violence has been defined in more granularity along the lines of physical, emotional or psychological, and sexual abuse. This change to the definition of family violence was also made to “align how abuse is defined in other acts such as the Child and Young Persons Act 1993 and the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018” (see Second Reading; for an example of how the definitions of “abuse” have been applied in the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018, see also <em>Re GEQ and another matter</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 376 at [26] where the court found that the respondent was guilty of “verbal, emotional or psychological abuse of” the vulnerable adult).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Physical abuse is defined as (s 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    “Physical abuse” —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    includes conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    causes, or threatens to cause, personal injury or physical pain to a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   threatens a person with the death or injury of the person; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    also includes wrongfully confining or restraining a person against the person’s will; but</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    does not include any force lawfully used —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    in self-defence; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   by way of correction towards a child below 18 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As for sexual abuse, that is defined as (s 58B(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    “Sexual abuse” includes conduct or behaviour that coerces, or attempts to coerce, a person to engage in sexual activity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Finally, emotional or psychological abuse is defined as (s 58B(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    “Emotional or psychological abuse” means conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    torments, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causes or may reasonably be expected to cause mental harm to a person, including thoughts of suicide or inflicting self-harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In addition, the new provisions also provide that abuse can either take the form of a single “instance of conduct or behaviour” or a “course of conduct of behaviour” (s 58B(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961). It also provides that the conduct or behaviour that amounts to abuse “need not be directed at the family member in question” but it has to be “capable of being seen, heard or otherwise perceived (directly or indirectly) by the family member in question” (s 58B(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961). The accompanying illustrations also provide guidance as to what constitutes physical, and emotional or psychological abuse:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"center\">Illustrations</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X spreads false rumours to third parties about X’s spouse being promiscuous. X’s spouse finds out about the rumours and is distressed. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against X’s spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    X is prone to smash furniture in X’s house when X is angry. This behaviour causes X’s child to be distressed and in fear of personal injury. X has committed physical abuse, as well as emotional or psychological abuse, against X’s child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    X repeatedly makes demeaning comments to belittle and humiliate Y in front of their children. X threatens to stop giving Y a monthly allowance if Y contacts Y’s family or friends or seeks help. Y suffers mental harm as a result. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Notwithstanding these changes to the definitions of family violence, the two requirements that an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, to succeed in their application (s 60A(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961), remains broadly the same. <b><em>First</em></b>, it must be shown that that the respondent has committed or is likely to commit family violence against the person sought to be protected. <b><em>Second</em></b>, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from ordering a PPO, the court can also grant additional orders. Under the previous family violence provisions, the court could only grant, in addition to a PPO, a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) and a counselling order (“CGO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With the amendments to the family violence provisions of the Women’s Charter, the suite of orders that the court may grant in addition to a PPO has been greatly expanded. For instance, apart from a DEO and a CGO, the court may also grant a stay-away order (“SAO”), a no-contact order (“NCO”) (see s 60B of the Women’s Charter 1961) and a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) (see s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">XNY's application for a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     XNY’s complaint was that he had suffered emotional and psychological abuse because of XNZ’s behaviour. He complained of the following incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first incident took place on 14 February 2025. XNZ had, in the days prior, applied for a PPO against him. On the 14<sup>th</sup> of February, XNY received the summons to attend court. He says this caused “significant emotional and mental stress” on him and his current wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The second incident took place on 3 March 2012. XNZ had taken out a PPO application against XNY. Consequently, XNY received a summons to attend court. XNY said that the complaint was false. He could not have committed family violence against XNZ as he was on reservist training. Although the case was dropped, XNY says he suffered “significant stress and fear of [XNZ]’s unpredictable behaviour and random baseless accusations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The third incident occurred on 2 April 2021. XNY received an unsolicited message on Whatsapp. XNZ said that she had slept with another man. She sent him a picture of an unknown man sleeping in her bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The fourth incident took place sometime in April 2017. XNZ had managed to track down and get in contact with XNY’s former boss (“C”). She told C that XNY and his mother had been using black magic on C’s wife. The use of such black magic, according to XNZ, caused C’s wife to fall ill. C subsequently contacted XNY to inform him about this incident. In XNY’s words:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">XNY:  And that’s where she contacted and just out rightly told told him that, you know, she has, like, a kind some kind of a secret and she would like to tell him now that, “Your wife actually passed away”, due to the doing of my late mum. And that’s how I got to know because my ex-boss was shocked to hear such a thing. I think he contacted me in a way to demand to know whether it’s true or not. Because, you know, it’s very sensitive, like, he just lost a wife, and then somebody just, out of nowhere, come and say such a thing, where I’ve not met her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Back then, it happened maybe 10 years or 11 years ago. And after I explained and I was shocked to hear that, of course, and I…and I have to explain, of course, you know you know, my mum is quite is very religious person and we come from a reputable family…And, of course, we are religious, and we will not do condone such a thing that what she mentioned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And I was lucky enough that my ex-boss, like, convinced that, of course, she’s…she’s trying to pull a false one. Whatever her motive of doing that, we are not sure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ had committed family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence on XNY – specifically, that her conduct or behaviour had harassed and/or distressed XNY (see s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I arrive at this conclusion based on the incident which had taken place in April 2017 (see above at [18]). XNY’s account of the incident was corroborated by C who testified at the trial before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     C confirmed that XNZ had indeed contacted him and told him that XNY and XNY’s mother had put a black magic spell on his wife, and that had caused her to become bedridden. In his words:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"13.96%\"><col width=\"86.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">At the time, my wife was---2017, my wife had already been bedridden for a good almost 8 years, alright? When she was bed…the time when she first got bedridden, [XNY] was still working with me. So that’s how---that---that---that’s how probably the knowledge of---of my wife being bedridden came out. And we were having very long hours, okay, when were at [XXX], and this was back in 07, 08, 09, 2010. It was very long hours. I was covering long hours as well. So apparently, the caller told me that [XNY] was not happy with spending so many hours at work, bearing in mind that this was 2017, 7 years after we parted ways in terms of our---our---our working together. So caller told me that the reason why my wife was bedridden was because [XNY] and his mother put a black magic spell on---on my wife, which I---I found very strange, but I didn’t want to say too much. I said, “Okay, noted. Thank you very much”, and along those lines. Conversation lasted maybe about 5 minutes or so. I was a little bit busy, and I did not really want to entertain this call because I hardly know the caller. And I just didn’t want to pursue it further because it was very distressing for me. So after we hung up, because I had made this call on my mobile, the---the caller sent me a---a---a message to follow up on what she said, and that’s what I printed out. So at the time, I knew that [XNY] was not in Singapore, and I sent him a message, “Call me straightaway.” Because we---we belong to the same professional organisation, and he was representing the organisation in a congress overseas. So I knew he was out of town. So he called me while, I think, he was in Greece or <em>en route</em> from Berlin to Greece, and I told him about the whole thing. And that was where he told me that his uncle or---or some relative was also contacted along the same lines to---basically just to mention negative points about [XNY]. So I also asked him if he wanted to make a police report, because if he wanted to make a police report, I would also follow up with mine. But when he came back, he decided not to. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright, [C], the caller in this case, could you tell me who was it?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">She identified herself as [XNZ], [XNY]’s ex-wife.

In that text message, XNZ identifies herself and also states that XNY had performed black magic on C’s wife. XNZ goes on to state that XNY had done so to take revenge on C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I found that XNZ had indeed contacted C, in this incident in 2017, to spread false rumours about XNY and his mother having performed black magic on C’s wife. That much was evident, not only from C’s testimony, but also the text message which C had produced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I also concluded that XNZ’s act of spreading such false rumours about XNY fell squarely within the definition of emotional or psychological abuse. It is clear from the words of s 58B(4) that whether a respondent’s conduct or behaviour amounts to emotional or psychological abuse is to be assessed with reference to the <b><em>impact</em></b> such conduct or behaviour has on the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is further reinforced by the explanatory statement contained in the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and Other Matters) (Amendment) Bill which states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(iv)  the definition of emotional or psychological abuse <b><u>refers to conduct or behaviour that distresses an individual</u></b>, and not to conduct or behaviour that is offensive to an individual;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As to the sort of conduct that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, one example may be found in Illustration (a) to s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961. Another example was also given by the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling in the Second Reading:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Stakeholders have shared situations where perpetrators threaten to withhold monthly allowance from their spouses, constantly call their spouses to check on their whereabouts and isolate them from their friends or family, including disallowing them to leave the house. If the spouses do not comply, they may be threatened by the perpetrator. These egregious forms of controlling behaviour – which falls within the definition of what some other jurisdictions call &quot;coercive control&quot; – can cause distress or mental harm to a survivor and would be considered emotional or psychological abuse under the new Bill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     While such examples provide a useful illustration of the sort of conduct or behaviour that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, it is important to not lose sight of the fact that an applicant must <b><em>prove</em></b> the impact of such conduct or behaviour. For example, if the allegation is that the conduct in question had either tormented, intimidated, harassed or distressed the person sought to be protected (to cite the words of s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961), the applicant bears the burden of proving this. That much is made clear by ss 103 and 104 of the Evidence Act 1893 which state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Burden of proof</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">103.—(1)    Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence of facts which the person asserts, must prove that those facts exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A desires a court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove that B has committed the crime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A desires a court to give judgment that A is entitled to certain land in the possession of B by reason of facts which A asserts and which B denies to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove the existence of those facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>On whom burden of proof lies</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">104.  The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A sues B for land of which B is in possession, and which, as A asserts, was left to A by the will of C, B’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, B would be entitled to possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A sues B for money due on a bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The execution of the bond is admitted, but B says that it was obtained by fraud, which A denies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, A would succeed as the bond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the present case, I found that XNY had indeed established that XNZ’s conduct had caused him distress. There were two factors which pointed me to this conclusion. First, I believed XNY’s account that he was staunchly religious, and in that vein, I inferred that such accusations must have distressed him greatly. Second, it was also clear to me from C’s testimony that the both of them shared a close relationship – this meant that XNY was also privy to C’s personal struggles, namely, that C’s wife was seriously ill and needed care. Further, XNY had evidently looked up to C as a mentor, and C clearly had high regard for XNY’s abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Viewed against this backdrop, it is clear how XNZ’s actions of spreading these allegations of black magic would have distressed XNY. It could have potentially ruined XNY’s reputation and relationship with someone whom he was not only close with, but who he also considered a personal mentor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, I turn now to deal with one other aspect of XNY’s complaint – that XNZ filing a PPO against him on 13 February 2025 had amounted to emotional abuse. In his testimony, XNY described how he was “emotionally and mentally” stressed because he had been hauled back to court for something that he did not do.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I do not consider that the stress which XNY had experienced as a result of XNZ taking out a PPO application against him could amount to emotional abuse. Parties are, after all, entitled to file their complaints, and there are safeguards to minimise the filing of frivolous or meritless complaints. PPO applications start life as a Magistrate’s Complaint, and if the judge hearing the complaint decides that if there is insufficient reason to proceed, the complaint may be dismissed: P 3 r 7(<em>c</em>) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. To give a few examples, a complaint may be dismissed in the following cases:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where it is plainly clear that the complaint is being made for a collateral purpose. It is, after all, well established that the bringing of an application for collateral purposes does amount to an abuse of process, and the court possesses the inherent power to “prevent an abuse of its processes”: <em>Ho Kiang Fah v Toh Buan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0398.xml')\">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 398</a> at [8] and [23]; <em>Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0348.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 348</a> at [22] citing <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9595-SSP-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</a> at [34]; <em>Heng Joo See v Ho Pol Ling</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0763.xml')\">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 763</a> at [21] (see Goh Yihan, “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent Powers of the Singapore Courts” (2011) Singapore Journal of Legal Studies 178 at p 207 citing <em>Emilia Shipping Inc. v State Enterprises for Pulp and Paper Industries</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0411.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 411</a> at [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the applicant has no standing to apply for the PPO (see s 60 read with s 58A of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where it is clear that the complaint is bound to fail even if one assumes that all the facts complained of are indeed true (<em>ie</em>, where the incidents complained of clearly do not fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961, or where it is plainly not necessary to make the order for the protection or the personal safety of the person in question).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     However, the fact that a complaint is accepted does not mean that the allegations contained within it are true. All it means is that the judge hearing the complaint has, in their assessment, considered that there is sufficient merit to the complaint. The respondent has a right to be heard. To facilitate this, the summons will be served on the respondent. And while this may cause some stress, which was XNY’s experience in the present case, this is an unavoidable consequence of the applicable procedural rules that govern PPO applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ was likely to commit family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In addition to finding that XNZ had committed family violence on XNY, I also found that XNZ was <b><em>likely</em></b> to commit family violence on XNY, specifically, that she was likely to continue to cause emotional or psychological abuse to XNY. There were, in my judgment, five factors which spoke to this:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident which took place in April 2017 which, as I have found (above at [19] – [29]), did cause XNY distress and thus amounted to emotional and/or psychological abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The incident in November 2021 where she had texted XNY to say that she was sleeping with a man. XNY had exhibited the message from XNZ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It showed a picture of an unknown man in a bed followed by a text: “[XNY], I sleep with a man.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     XNY also testified that XNZ had called him when she was warded at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and asked him to visit her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In this vein, there is also evidence that XNZ has a psychiatric condition for which she had been receiving treatment at IMH. XNZ had produced invoices from IMH which spoke to the treatment she was receiving from the psychiatrists as well as the medications which she had been prescribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     XNZ’s filing of the PPO applications against XNY, first, back in 2011, and subsequently in 2025. There are also the police reports which XNZ had filed against XNY. She alleged that she had seen XNY in the public areas that she frequents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Taken together, these five points demonstrated a clear pattern of conduct on XNZ’s part. Despite XNY having resolved to go his own separate way after their divorce, XNZ continued to harass him. This ranged from contacting his former boss to sending him unsolicited text messages about her sleeping with another man.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To be clear, XNZ’s pattern of conduct did not appear to be a campaign of harassment which she had consciously mounted against XNY as part of a vendetta that she had against him. There was nothing on the evidence to suggest that this was indeed the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was, however, evidence to show that XNZ was not well. She was seeking treatment from IMH for an undisclosed psychiatric condition. That XNZ was not well was also clear from her testimony where she described how she would regularly dream of XNY and his family members,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and how she would see XNY in places that she frequented which led her to believe that A was following her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">It was necessary to grant the PPO </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence, and was also likely to commit family violence, I turn now to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The previous family violence provisions provided that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and <b>that it is necessary for the </b><b><u>protection </u></b><b>of the family member</b>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, the newly enacted s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 makes it clear that the applicant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected. The legislative changes thus appear to have altered the necessity requirement by stipulating that a PPO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the <em>personal safety</em> of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This must be the case because while the word “protection” is conceivably wide enough to cover the ambit of “personal safety”, it is a well-established principle that because Parliament “shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”, the court should “endeavour to give significant to every word in an enactment”: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [38] citing <em>JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/50060-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 484</a> at [43]; <em>Shanmugam Manohar v Attorney-General and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25741-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 600</a> at [25]; <em>WCG v WCH</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 45 at [19]; <em>EQ Capital Investments Ltd v Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20810-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCR 15</a> at [30] citing <em>Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0874.xml')\">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 874</a> at [12]. The word “protection” must, therefore, have a different meaning from the phrase “personal safety”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As to what “protection” and “personal safety” means, no mention is made in the Second Reading of what these terms mean, and exactly what the scope of each was meant to cover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That being said, I am of the view that “personal safety” has a broader scope than “protection”. For one, it is clear that the legislative amendments were made with a view to strengthening the measures available to those who have suffered from family violence. For example, the Taskforce Report had recommended:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Recommendation 11B: Amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make additional types of orders to ensure the safety of the survivors of violence, including non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">92.    Under the Women’s Charter, the Court may grant a DEO to perpetrators of family violence in addition to a PPO. This DEO will require the perpetrator to be excluded from part of or the entire family home to better ensure the safety of the family violence survivor. However, under the Vulnerable Adults Act, there are further provisions for the Court to grant other types of orders in addition to the protection order to better protect the survivor of violence. These include orders prohibiting the respondent (i.e. the person whom the protection order was made against) from visiting or communicating with the applicant, or from entering or remaining in an area outside the applicant’s place of residence or any other place frequented by the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">93.    The Taskforce recommends that <b>the Government amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make </b><b><em><u>additional </u></em></b><b>types of orders, such as the above-mentioned non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders</b>, <b><em><u>to better ensure the safety of the person who applied for a PPO</u></em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     These recommendations from the Taskforce Report were indeed adopted, and have found expression in the new provisions which empower the court to make a SAO or NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) and s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Following from this, I consider that the notion of “protection” would only be confined to matters which directly impact an individual’s physical and mental state whereas the notion of “personal safety” must necessarily extend to, and encompass, an individual’s environment and their living circumstances that has an impact on their well-being. It is for this reason that the court now has the additional powers to grant a SAO or an NCO – both these orders go further than a PPO in that they severely limit any possible interactions between a respondent and the person protected by a PPO (“Y”). This ensures that Y has an environment in which they can enjoy a normalcy of life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Having dealt with the definitions of “protection” and “personal safety”, I turn now to address two other related points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The first is whether “or”, as is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, is to be read conjunctively or disjunctively. This point arises because s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) states that a PPO may only be ordered if it is necessary for the protection <b><em><u>or</u></em></b> personal safety of Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The plain and ordinary meaning of “or” produces a disjunctive result – however, in the context of statutory interpretation, “or” may be read conjunctively in order to give effect to the intention of Parliament”: <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53560-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 123</a> at [68] – [72]; <em>Peh Hai Yam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20194-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHC 69</a> at [65].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In the present case, given my observations above on Parliament’s intent to broaden the scope of protections available to those who have suffered family violence, and the difference in the scope of what “protection” and “personal safety” means, I do not think that “or”, as it is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 should be read conjunctively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The second is the requirement of the requirement of necessity. I consider that the key inquiry here must involve a risk assessment. The court considers the “likelihood of the respondent committing family violence against” the person sought to be protected: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19] – [20]. It is only in cases where the court has assessed there to be a sufficiently high risk of family violence being committed in the future, that a PPO will be necessary. After all, there are criminal consequences that follow from the breach of a PPO, and “ordering one is not a decision that a court would take lightly”: <em>XIO v XIP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32867-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 18</a> at [5] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this vein, the court can also consider whether the PPO is necessary to deter family violence – this was a point noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    Finally, it is also relevant to consider whether there is a need for a PPO to deter future family violence. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The possibility of arrest and being investigated by the Police can be a powerful deterrent against the commission of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    However, such a possibility may not be available if the offence arising from such violence is a “non-arrestable offence” in law. Examples include family violence which involve (i) assault / using criminal force under s 352 and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. What this means is that the perpetrators of such offences cannot be arrested without a warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    A PPO can address this issue. This is because the breach of a PPO is itself an arrestable offence: s 65(11) of the Charter. Thus, a respondent who voluntarily causes hurt to an applicant after the latter has been given a PPO may be arrested for breaching the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As to the indicators which speak to the likelihood of family violence being committed, they include, <em>inter alia</em>, unresolved causes of family violence and whether there would be continued future interactions between the parties: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, I found that it was indeed necessary to order the PPO for XNY’s personal safety. It was clear to me that the present case was one where XNZ’s conduct had impacted XNY’s living circumstances and thus exacted a toll on him. The way XNZ had acted was clearly affecting XNY’s personal life, as well as his professional relationships. I accepted XNY’s evidence that XNZ’s conduct had indeed taken an emotional toll on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Despite XNY’s best attempts to cut off any and all contact with B, she still found ways to get in touch with XNY and his colleagues. This resulted in an unenviable situation where XNY had to deal with the fallout from XNZ’s actions, with the clearest example of this being the false rumours XNZ had spread to C about XNY and his mother having performed black magic (see above at [18] – [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The evidence also showed that XNZ’s conduct was not a one-off event, but rather, a consistent pattern of behaviour over a period of several years. This suggested that there was some unresolved issue on XNZ’s part, and that this was the root cause of her continuing to act out in this manner against XNY. Until that issue was identified and resolved, it was likely that XNZ’s pattern of behaviour would continue into the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having decided to grant XNY’s application for a PPO, I also considered it necessary for his personal safety to order a NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. It was clear that XNY wanted nothing more to do with XNZ. The NCO was needed to ensure that XNY could put his past with XNZ behind him, and continue with his life, without living in anxiety that XNZ would try to make contact with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     That being said, and for completeness, I add that having ordered a NCO, I did not find it necessary to order a SAO. Such an order would require XNZ to stay away from XNY’s home or any other place frequented by XNY: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter. In order for XNZ to comply with a SAO, the addresses of XNY’s home, and other areas frequented by him would have to be disclosed to XNZ. I considered that doing so would frustrate the very purpose of making a NCO – and that was to lay down, and enforce a clear separation between XNY and XNZ, and to ensure that there was no further opportunity by which XNZ could continue to try and maintain contact with XNY.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that the evidence before me indicated that XNZ was receiving treatment from IMH, I also saw fit to order that a PAR be produced pursuant to s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961. While the court is empowered to make a MTO, there are several steps that must be taken before such an order may be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     First, the court must have reasonable grounds to believe that: <b>a)</b> the respondent is likely to be suffering from a psychiatric condition and <b>b)</b> that psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor for the respondent’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against them in the first place: s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To that end, the court <b><em>may</em></b>, before deciding if such reasonable grounds exist, call for a PAR: s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Notably, the language used in s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 suggests that it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR, and that the decision to call for a PAR lies solely within the court’s discretion: see also s 60F(8) of the Women’s Charter which states that there is no appeal against “any decision of the court to call for or not to call for a” PAR. One reason why it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR is that, in some cases, there may already be evidence before the court which establishes the requirements set out in s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Such evidence could take the form of an expert opinion (see generally P. 10 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, and in particular, P. 10 r. 3(1) which stipulates that leave of court must be obtained before expert evidence may be adduced).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, once the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it <b><em>must</em></b> call for a formal assessment report (“FAR”). The MTO can only be granted if the FAR certifies all the following matters (s 60F(16) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X is suffering from a psychiatric condition;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    the psychiatric condition is a contributing factor for X’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against X;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    the psychiatric condition is susceptible to treatment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    X is suitable for the treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the present case, and given the available evidence before me, I deemed it necessary to call for a PAR to assist me in ascertaining whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that XNZ had a psychiatric condition which was a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour that was the basis for granting the PPO. As I had noted, above at ([53]), XNZ’s conduct was clearly due to some unresolved issue on her part. And while that unresolved issue could likely be a result of a psychiatric condition, the evidence before me only suggested a correlation between the psychiatric condition and XNZ’s behaviour towards XNY. It did not suggest, or establish, a causative link (<em>ie</em>, that her psychiatric condition was likely a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To sum up, I allowed XNY’s application for a PPO in SSP 374. In addition, I also ordered a NCO, and called for a PAR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As for costs, XNY asked for $1000 in costs to “act as a deterrent”. In response, XNZ said that she was unemployed and could “maybe pay only $500”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Given that XNY did succeed in his application, he is, as a starting point, entitled to costs: P. 22 r. 3(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     An order of costs, however, does have practical implications. For example, in the context of divorce proceedings, it has been noted that an order of costs may only serve to “aggravate the acrimony between the parties”: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> at [32]. In other words, a costs order may also negatively affect the state of the relationship between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     One other practical implication insofar as costs are concerned is that details would have to be provided in order for payment to be made. For this to happen, there must necessarily be correspondence between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In the present case, I considered that the circumstances warranted a departure from this starting point. Ordering costs would, in my judgment, frustrate the very goal for which I had ordered the PPO and NCO (see above at [55]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     To be clear, I must emphasise that I am not laying down a bright line rule that if a NCO is ordered, the court will necessarily make no order as to costs. After all, costs are ultimately in the court’s discretion, and the exercise of that discretion necessarily turns on the specific facts of the case at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I therefore made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This was set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (which was in force prior to 2 January 2025).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, p 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, p 8 at lns 14 – 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>XNY’s Bundle of Documents marked “C1”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript p 10, lns 24 – 27; Transcript p 13, lns 28 – 31 to p 14, lns 1 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at pp 22 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript at p 26, lns 28 top 28 ln 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>s 65 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the provisions in effect prior to 2 January 2025).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Transcript at pp 8 – 9.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Revocation of protection order – Applicable principles"],"date":"2025-04-25","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 1198 of 2024","title":"XDB v XDC","citation":"[2025] SGFC 44","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33189-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant in person","Poonam Lachman Mirchandani (M/s Mirchandani & Partners) for the Respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-07-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XDB v XDC</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XDB <em>v</em> XDC </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33189-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 44</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS No. 1198 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">25 April 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kow Keng Siong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Applicant in person; Poonam Lachman Mirchandani (M/s Mirchandani &amp; Partners) for the Respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XDC — XDB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family violence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Orders for protection</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Revocation of protection order</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Applicable principles</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">25 April 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Section 67(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) allows a party to seek the revocation of a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) made against him/her. To succeed, the party must prove that the PPO is no longer necessary. What must the party establish to satisfy this requirement? The present case presents an opportunity to address this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In February 2023, the Respondent obtained a PPO against the Applicant, her ex-husband: PPO xx4/2023 (“<b>PPO xx4</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In June 2024, the Applicant applied to revoke PPO xx4. Among others, he submitted that after the PPO was issued, (a) the parties have lived in different households and (b) the Respondent did not make any more allegation of family violence against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Applicant added that the continuation of the PPO would impede his efforts to normalise his relationship with his children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Respondent strenuously objected to the revocation of PPO xx4. Among others, she alleged that the Applicant had continued to harass her after the PPO was issued, and that she was fearful that he would physically harm her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Before dealing with the parties’ contentions, it is useful to summarise the principles for revoking a PPO. They are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Applicant’s legal burden of proof</em>. To begin, a party applying to revoke a PPO (“<b>applicant</b>”) has the legal burden of proof – i.e., he/she must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the <em>PPO is no longer necessary to protect the person stated in the order</em> (“<b>respondent</b>”). This legal burden remains with the applicant throughout the revocation proceedings: s 103 of the Evidence Act 1893 (“<b>Evidence Act</b>”). In other words, the respondent does not have the legal burden to prove that the PPO is still necessary: <em>AZB v AYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a> at [28]; <em>Joycelyn Toh Hui Yu v Toh Siew Luan Bette</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0275.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 275</a> (“<b><em>Joycelyn Toh</em></b>”) at [17(e)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Discharging the legal burden</em>. In determining whether the applicant has discharged his burden of proof, the relevant considerations include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)       Why was the PPO issued against the applicant in the first place? See e.g., <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [15] to [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       Has there been any incident of family violence <em>after</em> the PPO was issued? See e.g., <em>XGG v XGH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32623-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 111</a> at [35(c)], [36] and [39]. If the answer is yes, then it is generally not appropriate to revoke the PPO unless –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_1\"></a>(1)       The violence is very dated: see e.g., <em>XFL v XFM</em> [2024] 103 (“<b><em>XFL</em></b>”) at [20(b)],</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_2\"></a>(2)       The harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. (This well-established principle has sometimes been expressed as <em>de minimis non curat lex</em>), or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_3\"></a>(3)       The violence is committed in extenuating circumstances, e.g., due to intense provocation by the respondent: <em>VYR v VYS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26982-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 128</a> at [44] and [45]; <em>XFL</em> at [20(a)]; <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [49(a)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Has the respondent <em>abused</em> the PPO by using it to oppress or provoke the applicant – instead of for protection?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       Is the applicant likely to commit family violence in the future?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Material change of circumstances.</em> In determining the issue in [5(b)(iv)] above, an important consideration is whether there has been a material change in the circumstances since the PPO was issued – such that the applicant no longer has any opportunity or reason to commit family violence in future. Some factors that can be relevant to this consideration include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i_1\"></a>(i)       Has the underlying cause for family violence been resolved between the parties? See e.g., <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a> at [2] and [27(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii_2\"></a>(ii)       Are the parties likely to have future interactions with each other? If so, then what is the extent of such interactions, and are they likely to be opportunities/occasions for conflict and family violence?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii_3\"></a>(iii)       Is the applicant still deeply antagonistic towards the respondent?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv_4\"></a>(iv)       Does the applicant have a propensity for committing family violence? See e.g., <em>XFL</em> at [21(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Resisting a revocation application</em>. To resist an application to revoke a PPO, the respondent can assert, e.g., that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The applicant has committed family violence <em>after</em> the PPO was issued,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The applicant is likely to commit such violence in future,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>New issues</em> have surfaced after the PPO was issued and these may become flashpoints for the applicant to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>It bears highlighting that when the respondent makes assertions such as the above, he/she has the <em>evidential</em> burden of proving them on a balance of probabilities: s 105 of the Evidence Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Irrelevant matters</em>. For completeness, it is useful to add that in line with the <em>res judicata</em> principle, a court hearing a revocation application will proceed on the basis that the PPO has been validly issued in the first place. Accordingly –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i_5\"></a>(i)       The court will not review the correctness of the decision to issue the PPO: <em>Harvey Llewellyn Campbell v Angeline Yam Lai Lin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/51594-M.xml')\">[2006] SGDC 227</a> at [5] to [8]; <em>Joycelyn Toh</em> at [17(a)] and [17(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii_6\"></a>(ii)       Neither will the court consider –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_1_7\"></a>(1)       Arguments and evidence which have, or could have, been considered when the PPO was issued: <em>ACZ v ADC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/65077-M.xml')\">[2009] SGDC 457</a> (“<b><em>ACZ</em></b>”) at [13] and [25], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_2_8\"></a>(2)       Fresh evidence that may be relevant to the decision on whether to issue the PPO: <em>ACZ</em> at [15] and [22]; <em>AHQ v AHR</em> [2010] SGDC at [9], [13] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Having summarised the relevant principles, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for PPO xx4</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I begin by noting that PPO xx4 was issued for the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Family violence committed</em>. The judge who heard the Respondent’s PPO application (“<b>DJ Lee</b>”) found that the Applicant had, without the Respondent’s consent, installed CCTV cameras in their matrimonial home (“<b>Home</b>”) and an Air-Tag in her car. DJ Lee found that such acts constituted continual harassment and were done to cause anguish to the Respondent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>PPO was necessary</em>.

She tendered a video recording of one such incident which occurred on 9 June 2024. The Respondent alleged that the Applicant knew that she would feel threatened by such intrusions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Regarding the video recording, the Applicant explained that the incident had occurred when he was taking over the care of the children. He was searching for his son at the material time when he noticed that the Respondent’s bedroom door was ajar. He decided to check the room to see if his son was there. According to the Applicant, he did not know that the Respondent was inside the room. He admitted that he should have checked before entering the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Respondent had failed to show that the Applicant had entered her bedroom to harass her. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I begin with the video recording of the 9 June incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the recording merely shows that the Applicant had (i) stuck his upper torso into the room from behind the door, (ii) peered around the room to look for someone (or something), (iii) glanced at the Respondent’s direction very briefly, and (iv) thereafter withdrawn his body from behind the door. The entire process lasted for only about 4 seconds. During this time, the Applicant had a neutral look on his face. He did not stare or make any gesture at the Respondent. Neither did he say anything to her. The recording did not show that the Applicant had harassed or intimidated the Respondent at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I find that the recording is more consistent with the Applicant’s explanation that he had peered into the Respondent’s room to look for his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Applicant’s explanation (that he was looking for his son at the material time) is inherently credible in view of the following <em>undisputed</em> facts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The 9 June incident took place at about 6.17 pm. This is shortly after 6.00 pm – the time when the Respondent was supposed to hand over the children to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The children could enter the Respondent’s room whenever they wanted. For instance, they would sometimes “hang out” in her room to use her iPad.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       The bedroom door was not closed before the Applicant peered into the room. If the Respondent did not want to be disturbed while she was in the room, she would have closed the door fully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to the Respondent’s allegation that apart from the 9 June incident, the Applicant had “intruded” into her bedroom on other occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I find this allegation to be too generic and bare of details. It is not clear, for instance, on which occasions and in what circumstances these intrusions had occurred. Such information is critical (i) to enable the Applicant to properly respond to the allegation, and (ii) for me to assess whether the allegation is credible and reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not tender video recordings of the Applicant’s “intrusions” into her bedroom <em>other than</em> the 9 June incident. This is puzzling, given the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Respondent, she had been advised by the Police to make recordings if the Applicant were to commit family violence against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Respondent did not dispute the Applicant’s evidence that she had made “a huge number of video recordings” of him at the Home after PPO xx4 was issued.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The admission of such video recordings would have supported the Respondent’s case that the Applicant had repeatedly “intruded” into her bedroom without any excuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, if the Respondent had felt either (i) harassed by the Applicant’s “intrusions” or (ii) fearful of him, then she could easily have installed a simple lock on the inside of her bedroom door to prevent such intrusions. Strangely, she failed to do so. I find her explanation for such a failure – that she could not afford to buy even a cheap lock – to be unconvincing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged obstruction of the Respondent’s passage at the Home</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I now turn to the Respondent’s next allegation of harassment. According to her, when the Applicant detected that she was leaving her bedroom to go to the ground floor, he would frequently (a) rush out of his bedroom and (b) stand at the top of the stairs leading to the ground floor to obstruct her passage or so that she had to walk close to him. The Respondent tendered a video recording of one such incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s allegation that the Applicant had regularly obstructed her from going down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, such an allegation is not borne out by the video recording that she had tendered as evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The recording shows the Respondent standing behind her bedroom door for about 6 seconds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When she opened the door, the Applicant also opened his bedroom door at about the same time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       On seeing the Respondent, the Applicant <em>turned away from her</em> direction and stood at the doorway to his bedroom – as if to let her pass him first.

A short while later, she opened the toilet door stepped out.

Soon thereafter, the Applicant walked down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       Throughout the incident the Applicant did not say anything to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not tender any other video recording to support her allegation that the Applicant had regularly obstructed her passage down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Handover of the children during the 2024 summer holiday</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will now address the Respondent’s next allegation of harassment. According to her, this took place during the children’s 2024 summer holiday in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The background to this incident is not disputed. In late June 2024, the Applicant left Singapore with the children for Bordeaux for the holiday. The Respondent left Singapore later – in early July – for Bergerac. The plan was for the Applicant to hand over the children to the Respondent in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s case is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant was supposed to hand over the children in <em>Bergerac</em>. The Respondent’s case is based on clause 16 of a court order issued in June 2024 (“<b>June 2024 Order</b>”). According to that clause, the Applicant shall “personally hand over” the children to the Respondent for the summer school holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Contrary to clause 16, the Applicant had wanted the handover to take place in <em>Bordeaux</em>. After the Respondent’s repeated emails from 30 June to 2 July on the issue, the Applicant eventually agreed to hand over the children in Bergerac. He agreed to do so only on 3 July – i.e., the day of her arrival in France. The Applicant’s initial indication for the handover to take place in Bordeaux and his late reply to the Respondent emails had caused her immense distress at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Later in the same trip, the Applicant had refused to pick up the children from her in Bergerac and insisted that she had to send them to him in Bordeaux.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     According to the Applicant,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Respondent’s interpretation of the June 2024 Order was erroneous. He also denied being unresponsive to her emails regarding the handover arrangement. According to him, his emails regarding the issue had been constructive, non-threatening, and showed that he had acted in the children’s best interests at all material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The issue is whether the Applicant had “created” or exploited the handover issue to harass the Respondent. In my view, the answer is no. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the correspondence shows that there had been a <em>bona fide difference in views</em> between the parties regarding what was the most practical handover arrangement during the 2024 summer holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Handover from the Applicant to the Respondent</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Respondent had wanted the Applicant to <em>personally pilot a chartered plane</em> to fly the children to Bergerac airport for the handover.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       On the other hand, the Applicant believed that what the Respondent had wanted him to do was unrealistic as it was contingent on several factors being met – i.e., that his license was valid, the weather allowed for it, the cost was low, and the air club had a plane to lend him for the trip. All these conditions could not be met at the material time. Instead, he felt that it was more feasible for the children to take a commercial flight to Bordeaux airport. This is because the Respondent was herself flying into that airport. The children and she could thus fly into Bordeaux airport, meet there, and then travel together by car to Bergerac. These explanations had been provided to the Respondent’s lawyers on 1 July and 3 July 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Clause 16 of the June 2024 Order states that the Applicant is to hand over the children to the Respondent for the summer school holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The order does not stipulate that the handover must take place in Bergerac. Given that the Respondent was going to arrive in Bordeaux airport (before driving to Bergerac), an argument can be made that a handover at Bordeaux airport (instead of Bergerac) is consistent with the June 2024 Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Handover from the Respondent to the Applicant</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       As for the Respondent’s insistence that the Applicant <em>pick up</em> the children from her in Bergerac later in the holiday, clause 16 does not stipulate that he must do so. She did not refer me to any other provision in the June 2024 Order to support her position that she was entitled to hand over the children in Bergerac. In the circumstances, it is reasonable for the Applicant to take the view that since the children were with the Respondent at the material time, it is for her to <em>hand over</em> to him the children. Under this view, the handover point should thus be Bordeaux since he was there at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, as a matter of principle, the Applicant cannot be said to commit “continual harassment” (as the term is defined in s 64 of the Charter) by <em>simply disagreeing</em> with the Respondent on the handover issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_i_9\"></a>(i)       To constitute such harassment, there must be something more – the Applicant must have (1) intentionally held a clearly unreasonable interpretation of the June 2024 Order or (2) acted unreasonably pursuant to his interpretation of the order. In such cases, the Applicant may be inferred to have disagreed with the Respondent intending or knowing that his unreasonable conduct is likely to cause anguish to her. A contrary view – that the Applicant commits “continual harassment” even if he has a reasonable basis for disagreeing with the Respondent and does so reasonably – is absurd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_ii_10\"></a>(ii)       In the present case, the Respondent has failed to prove that the Applicant’s disagreement over the handover issue was unreasonable and thus constituted “continual harassment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Removal of the Respondent’s belongings from the Home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Next, I turn to a highly contentious issue at the hearing. This concerns the removal of the Respondent’s belongings from the Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     By way of background, (a) the parties were staying in a black-and-white property at the material time, (b) the lease for this property was due to end on 15 August 2024, and (c) the Respondent had secured a place to stay from 16 August 2024 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     According to the Respondent, she had the right to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024. She relied on two pieces of evidence to support this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Clause 18 of the June 2024 Order states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff shall be allowed to remain in [the Home] with the said 3 children <em>until the expiry of the current lease</em> [on] 15 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 20 June 2024, the Applicant’s lawyers sent a letter to the Respondent’s lawyers (“<b>20 June Letter</b>”). Paragraph 3 of this letter states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Clause 18 of the Order provides that your client shall be allowed to remain in the [Home] with the Children until the expiry of the current lease on 15 August 2024.

The Applicant had done so knowing (a) that she was holidaying in France at the material time and (b) her objections to her belongings being moved. Furthermore, he did not promptly provide her with the key to the storage facility holding her belongings. According to the Respondent, the Applicant’s actions – which left her stranded with nowhere to stay upon her return to Singapore on 11 August 2024 – was calculated to cause her distress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Applicant submitted that it was not reasonable for the Respondent to assume that she could stay at the Home until 15 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she knew that the Home had to be reinstated <em>before</em> the lease expired on 15 August 2024. The parties had discussions about this on many occasions. In line with the need for reinstatement, the Applicant had in fact already packed most of her belongings into boxes by the time he left with the children for the June 2024 summer holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Applicant had sent the following two emails to the Respondent in July 2024 regarding the need for her to move out of the Home for the purpose of the reinstatement:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Email dated 18 July 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">... could you <em>please confirm</em> that you have <em>removed all your belongings from our [Home]</em>?

If I don’t hear from you <em>by July 22nd</em>, I will organize to clear the house. <em>Be assured that any items left will be stored securely, and I will provide you with access to them if required</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response to the above, the Respondent sent the following email to the Applicant on 23 July 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... you are now issuing me with UNILATERAL deadlines, demanding that I move the Children’s and my belongings. I do not agree to you moving my and the Children’s belongings at the [Home] and if you do, it will be in clear contravention of DJ Lee’s order that allows me and the Children to remain at [the Home] until 15 August 2024. You are in no way doing your part as of the orders of the court in order for me to facilitate the move. You knowing full well that I am currently away in France, unable to move my and the children’s things not just because of lack of funds but because of the obvious logistics of me being in France. I had tried to organise being set up well before my departure to Singapore and even had my lawyers send you multiple letters to do as the orders of the court 13th June 2024. However, as dated from your lawyers, it was specifically clear that you would not pay and that they even reiterated that I should stay in the [Home] until the end of the tenancy which is the 15th August. Your changing positions is not welcome and is intentioned to cause me unnecessary stress. Therefore, as per that order, that is what I am doing. Should you take my belongings before then or should I not be able to stay in the [Home] for any reason until that date, YOU WILL BE BREACHING THE ORDERS OF THE COURT GIVEN AS OF THE 13TH JUNE 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     According to the Applicant, he had no choice but to get the movers to put her belongings into storage in early August – so that the Home could be reinstated and handed back to the landlord by 15 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Regarding the storage facility key issue, the Applicant explained that he did not intend to cause the Respondent distress. The issue about the key had slipped his mind. He was still in France with the children at the material time. In any event, he had responded to the Respondent regarding the key issue on the same day when she queried him about it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I find that the Respondent knew, at all material times, that the Home had to be vacated <em>before</em> 15 August 2024 so that reinstatement works could be done. This finding is based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant had sent an email to the Respondent on 31 July 2024. In that email, he stated, among others, the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_i\"></a>(i)       That the Respondent was “fully aware” of the requirement for reinstatement to be done <em>before</em> the Home was to be surrendered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       That this requirement was stipulated in the Home’s lease agreement. (In my view, this assertion is inherently credible as the need for reinstatement is an important condition to a lease.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       That the lease agreement had already been sent to her lawyers on their request “during the interim applications proceedings”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The “interim application proceedings” in question would have been related to (i) the renewal of the Home’s lease agreement (7 July <em>2023</em>) and/or (ii) the <em>June 2024 Order</em> (13 June 2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, on 1 August 2024, the Respondent had provided a point-by-point rebuttal to various issues raised in the Applicant’s 31 July email. Glaringly, she did not deny the Applicant’s assertion summarised in [31(a)] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent’s knowledge about the need to vacate the Home before the lease expired is also evident from her police report filed on 12 August 2024. In that report, she had stated the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">My ex-husband and I have an interim maintenance and care of the children order from the 13<sup>th</sup> June 2024 ... stating that I am entitled to live in the marital home until the 15<sup>th</sup> August when the tenancy lease expires. <b><em>I had tried to move out immediately after the order was given prior to my departure to France on holiday</em></b>, but he informed my lawyers that he would not pay for my rental until the end of the current lease (15 August). ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Respondent had relied on clause 18 of the June 2024 Order to assert that she was entitled to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024 – the very last day of the lease. In my view, it is not entirely clear that clause 18 supports her position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Clause 18 can be interpreted in two ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       One interpretation (the one used by the Respondent) is to read clause 18 based on the emphasis in bold below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">The Plaintiff shall be <b>allowed to remain</b> in [the Home] with the said 3 children <b>until </b><em>the expiry of the current lease</em> [on] <b>15 August 2024</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The second interpretation gives emphasis to the text in italics above. It could reasonably be argued that by referring to the “current lease”, the clause had envisaged that the Respondent’s stay in the Home was subject to the conditions in that lease – which would include the requirement to reinstate the Home. Under this interpretation, the date “15 August 2024” in clause 18 is merely a reference to the expiry date of the Home’s lease and does not stipulate the last day that the Respondent could stay at the Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The ambiguity in clause 18 could have been avoided through better drafting. For instance, if DJ Lee had intended for the Respondent to be allowed to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024, then the text “the expiry of the current lease” should have been omitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There is no evidence to show whether DJ Lee had been alerted by the parties to (i) the ambiguity in clause 18 and (ii) the need to factor in sufficient time for the Home to be reinstated before its surrender on 15 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If DJ Lee had been alerted to these matters, I seriously doubt that she would make the order in clause 18. This is because it is plainly unreasonable for the Respondent to be allowed to stay in the Home until the very last day of its lease given that the reinstatement works would take time – especially when the Home is a black-and-white house and the parties had stayed there for more than 10 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Respondent had also relied on the 20 June Letter to support her entitlement to stay in the Home until 15 August 2024. According to her, the letter gave her this impression. It is unclear how the Respondent could have come to such an impression. I say this because the letter <em>clearly</em> states that – “In view of DJ Lee’s Order, arrangements have been made for the [Home] <em>to be returned to the landlord on 15 August 2024</em>” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     To sum up –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent had failed to prove her case that the Applicant had created the situation regarding the removal of her belongings from the Home to harass her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I accept the Applicant’s evidence that he had no choice but to get the movers to put her belongings into storage in early August – so that the Home could be reinstated and handed back to the landlord by 15 August 2024: see [29] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I also accept the Applicant’s evidence regarding the storage facility key issue: see [30] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged harassment in the Applicant’s communications</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I now move to the Respondent’s final allegation. According to her, the Applicant had continued to be “harassing, constantly bullying, and threatening in his communication with [her]” after the PPO was issued.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s allegation against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Respondent had failed to substantiate her bare allegation. There would not have been any difficulty for her to adduce evidence of the Applicant’s alleged threats/harassment. This is because based on her evidence, (i) the threats/harassment were in the form of messages/emails which can easily be produced in court, and (ii) there were several such communications. Given these circumstances, the Respondent’s failure to adduce the relevant threatening/harassing communications casts doubt on veracity of her allegation against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent’s allegation that the Applicant was someone who would send threatening/harassing communications does not gel with his emails that have been tendered in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> I find the tone and content in these emails to be restrained and civil. This is so even when the Respondent had levelled harsh accusations against him in her emails.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Dog Air-Tag</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I note that during cross-examination, the Respondent had testified to being fearful of being placed under surveillance by the Applicant. She alleged that she had found an Air-Tag in her home with the name of his dog, “A” (“<b>Dog’s Air-Tag</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I did not place any weight on this allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the allegation was made belatedly – (i) it was not “put” to the Applicant, (ii) it did not appear in the Respondent’s affidavit or examination-in-chief, and (iii) it was raised for the first time only during the tail end of her evidence under cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not provide any evidence to show that the Applicant had planted the Dog’s Air-Tag to track/harass <em>her</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, when pressed on whether she was making any accusation against the Applicant regarding the Dog’s Air-Tag, the Respondent clarified that (i) she was merely stating that the Air-Tag was found in her home, and (ii) she did not know whether the Dog’s Air-Tag was even working. No reference was made to the issue of the Dog’s Air-Tag in her closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To sum-up, the Respondent had failed to prove her allegation that the Applicant had continued to harass her after PPO xx4 was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Is the Applicant likely to commit family violence in future</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I will now consider whether the Applicant is likely to commit family violence against the Respondent in future: see [5(b)(iv)] and [5(c)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In this regard, I note that when DJ Lee issued PPO xx4, she had considered that the parties were likely to meet each other because of access and other arrangements regarding their children: see [7(b)] above. Presumably, DJ Lee was concerned that such contacts could become flashpoints for the Applicant to harass the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In this regard, the Applicant submitted that he is unlikely to commit such family violence in future. He highlighted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, when PPO xx4 was imposed in February 2023, the parties were still married and living together. There has been a material change in circumstances since then. Specifically, the parties (i) have obtained interim judgement for divorce (in May 2023), (ii) have been living in different premises (since August 2024), and (iii) have minimal interactions with each other. Their communications are now conducted through emails or letters between their respective lawyers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the handovers of the children at the Respondent’s condominium (i) have been taking place regularly without the need for parties to meet each other and (ii) have been incident-free. As the children grow older, they can travel to the parties’ place of residence by themselves.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     According to the Respondent, the PPO is still necessary. She is concerned that the Applicant will harass her if it is revoked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, despite the parties living apart, they continue to have dealings with each other because of the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There are several occasions each month when they will need to handover the children at her condominium.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, their children are still young and schooling – 15 years, 13 years, and 12 years – and the parties will thus need to meet at the various school-related and children’s activities.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there are various contentious legal proceedings between the parties.

Such a submission shows that he lacked (i) awareness of the effect of his conduct on her and (ii) remorse.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent is fearful that the Applicant may physically hurt her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my view, it is unlikely that the Applicant will harass the Respondent in future. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46      <em>First</em>, I accept the Applicant’s submissions at [43(a)] above that there has been a material change in circumstances since the PPO was imposed. These changes make it unlikely for him to want to place her under surveillance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Reason for PPO.</em> PPO xx4 was issued on the <em>sole basis</em> that the Applicant had, without the Respondent’s consent, installed CCTV cameras in the Home (in February 2022) and Air-Tags in the Respondent’s car (in April 2022). DJ Lee found that the installation of these devices had caused her distress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Reasons for installing surveillance devices.</em> According to the Applicant, he had installed the surveillance devices to prevent the Respondent from (i) falsely accusing him of having committed family violence at the Home, and (ii) disposing the matrimonial assets kept there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>No more motive.</em> At the time of this judgement, the parties have been leading separate lives for some time. They no longer share a common communal space. As such, (i) the Applicant’s reasons for placing the Respondent under surveillance in the first place no longer exist, and (ii) the opportunities for him to harass her – e.g., by intruding into her private space – is practically zero.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47      <em>Second</em>, the evidence shows (fortunately) that the children’s care and other arrangements have not become a source of conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Physical contact is rare.</em> Since the parties started living apart, they have seldom come into physical contact with each other because of the children. It is undisputed that children’s handover can – and has – taken place without the Applicant having to engage the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Interactions have been incident-free.</em> On the occasions where the parties had been in physical contact, e.g., handing over of the children’s passports and helping to load/unload the luggage into the Applicant’s car for the children’s holidays,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> there is no evidence that the Applicant had harassed the Respondent. In coming to this view, I am mindful that there was an incident with the children’s handover during the 2024 summer holiday. In my view, that incident was neither created nor exploited by the Applicant for the purpose of harassing the Respondent: see [22] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Occasions for disagreement have been reduced by court orders.</em> The occasions for disagreements between the parties are likely to be reduced moving forward. I say this because after the PPO was imposed, various interim orders had been issued (in June 2024) that clarified the parties’ rights and obligations relating to the children’s care and control arrangements, as well as their maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Applicant can act rationally when dealing with children’s issues.</em> Where they were disagreements over the children’s issues, the Applicant had chosen to engage with the Respondent on these issues squarely – instead of resorting to threats and harassment to resolve them: see [37(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     At this juncture, I wish to address three matters raised by the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Ongoing legal proceedings.</em> Contrary to her submission, I am not persuaded that PPO xx4 is still necessary just because there are ongoing legal proceedings between the parties. The Respondent has failed to show why this fact alone justifies the continuation of the PPO. I note that the parties have been embroiled in legal proceedings since 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> There is no evidence to show, e.g., that the Applicant had initiated or used these proceedings to harass the Respondent, or that such proceedings make him more prone to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Whether Applicant lacks insight into the effects of his conduct on the Respondent.</em> Additionally, I disagree with the Respondent’s contention regarding the Relevant Submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It bears highlighting that the Applicant had made the Relevant Submission in the context of <em>two strongly contested issues</em> – i.e., whether he had harassed the Respondent, (1) during the handover of the children during the 2024 summer holiday, and (2) by removing her belongings from the Home without her consent In August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Applicant had made the Relevant Submission to persuade me to decide on the two disputed matters based on the facts – instead of stereotypical thinking that women are victims and men are abusers. In my view, the Applicant should be given some latitude to decide how best to frame his case for the two disputed matters. Otherwise, his ability to effectively present his case and discredit the Respondent’s case will be severely curtailed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Whether Applicant will be physically violent towards the Respondent.</em> Contrary to the Respondent’s submission, I find it unlikely that the Applicant will physically hurt her if the PPO is revoked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Respondent submission that he will hurt her is based on an “assumption”. According to the Respondent, she had formed this assumption because he did not attend the children’s parent-teacher meetings. She reasoned that he had been absent because he was afraid that he might not be able to control himself and might begin to hurt her if he were to see her at such meetings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I find the Respondent’s assumption to be highly fanciful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       There is no evidence to show that the Applicant has a propensity for using physical violence against the Respondent. It is an undisputed fact that <em>even before PPO xx4 was imposed</em>, she did not put a lock on the inside of her bedroom to prevent him from entering her bedroom.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Respondent would not have been so blasé about not installing such a lock if the Applicant is prone to using physical violence and she is fearful of him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       I find that the Respondent is a woman who is not afraid to assert her rights and to take appropriate measures to protect her personal safety and interests. This is evident from the fact that she (1) had applied for PPO against the Applicant (in 2022),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> (2) had filed police reports against him (in 2022 and 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> (3) had recorded the Applicant’s actions when she felt threatened during the time they were staying together, and (4) had no hesitation in using harsh language in her emails to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The Applicant will know that if he were to commit family violence against her, she will not hesitate to place the full weight of the law on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49      <em>Finally</em>, having observed the Applicant testify in court, I sense that he has decided to move on with his life. I do not get the impression that he harbours deep animosity towards the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I find that PPO xx4 is no longer necessary to deter the Applicant from committing family violence against the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my view, the revocation of PPO xx4 is in line with the parties’ wish for co-parenting to play a larger role in their children’s lives. This wish is evident, for instance, from the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A few months before the hearing, the Respondent had decided to personally hand over the daughter’s passport to the Applicant at the airport. According to the Respondent, she had wanted to demonstrate to the children that she could work together with the Applicant as co-parents, and that she was not afraid of him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Applicant, he wants PPO xx4 to be revoked because it sends a strong negative signal that he is likely to commit family violence, and that such a signal hampers his efforts to normalise his relationship with his children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Accordingly, I revoke the PPO with immediate effect.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 13 September 2024 at [11]; Oral submissions on 14 March 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The reasons appear in the Records of Proceedings for SS xx2/2023 on 3 February 2023 (Day 7) from page 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See the Records of Proceedings for SS xx2/2023 on 3 February 2023 (Day 7) at pages 36 and 37; Respondent’s complaint (SSA xxx1/2022) dated 29 April 2022.

Since then, there have been protracted proceedings before the Court. Shortly after a case conference on 23 October 2024 and before the 1<sup>st</sup> hearing of the ancillary matters (AMs) on 19 December 2024, the Husband filed an application for a personal protection order (PPO) on behalf of the three (3) children of the marriage, C1 (14 years old), C2 (10 years old) and C3 (7 years old) on 4 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The PPO application was heard on 23 January 2025 (with written submissions filed on 17 April 2025) and dismissed on 8 May 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing for the AMs, specifically the custody, care and control of and access to the children, was fixed on the same day i.e. 8 May 2025. Counsel for the Husband sought an adjournment, communicating the Husband’s hope and wish for reconciliation with the Wife. Given the lengthy course of proceedings, counsel for the Wife objected to the adjournment. I stood the matter down for counsel for the Wife to confirm with his client that there is no possibility of reconciliation. After speaking with the Wife, counsel confirmed that his client was firmly against any reconciliation and wished to proceed with the divorce to its conclusion. I proceeded to hear the AMs and now make my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and History of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties were married on 25 March 2010. Interim judgment was granted on 7 September 2022 based on the Parties’ respective claim and counterclaim of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the other Party. The effective length of the marriage is about 12.5 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both the Wife and the Husband had filed applications for interim orders in these proceedings. Since July 2022, the Wife has interim care and control over C2 and C3, while the Husband has interim care and control of C1. The background and context as to why such orders were made were set out in a separate judgment dismissing the Husband’s PPO application and shall not be repeated (see <em>XMB v XMA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33229-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 52</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Under two interim maintenance orders, the Husband is to pay the Wife:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $250 per month for October and November 2023 and $1,000 per month with effect from 8 December 2023 as her maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $670 per month as maintenance for C2 ($380) and C3 ($290) with effect from 11 February 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There were also backdated maintenance ordered to account for the failure and neglect to pay maintenance before the interim maintenance orders were made. At the hearing on 8 May 2022, counsel for the Wife informed that the Husband has yet to make a single payment of maintenance to the Wife and the arrears are standing at $44,500 (as of May 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The issues before the Court are as follows: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody, care and control of and access to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the Wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Maintenance for the children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed by the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The following are the affidavits filed by the Parties for the hearing of the AMs: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"28.5342931413717%\"><col width=\"35.9128174365127%\"><col width=\"35.5528894221156%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Affidavit</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Wife’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Husband’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Affidavit of Assets and Means </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA1</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA1</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA2</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA2</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA3</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>-</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There are numerous other affidavits filed by the Parties for their applications for interim orders and for the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories. The Parties also filed affidavits to explain the circumstances leading to the cessation of access sometime from February/March 2024 onwards. Where necessary, these affidavits will be referred to by the date on which they are filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s father, Mr [T] filed an affidavit in support of the Husband’s case that he had given loans to the Husband totalling $275,000 over the span of more than 10 years and that upon the sale of a commercial property (referred to in this judgment as the “ST property”) in September 2022, he had been repaid the sum of $235,000 from the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Custody, care and control of and access to the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Parties are agreed that there should be joint custody of the children, save that the Wife sought to have the final say on the children’s educational matters. They are also each seeking care and control of all three (3) children. While the Husband proposes reasonable access (in the event that he has care and control of the children), the Wife’s position is that the Husband should have supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A Child Representative (CR) was appointed based on the Parties’ agreement. Mr Yap Teong Liang, who was the appointed CR, submitted his report to Court on 9 December 2024. This was done after a prolonged delay in which he attempted to arrange for interviews with the Husband and C1 to no avail between the period from 22 August to 8 November 2024. So as not to delay the matter any further, the Court had directed the CR to submit his report, notwithstanding that he had not been able to interview the Husband and C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The CR was of the view that there should be joint custody of the children. Although the Wife sought to have the final say in the children’s education up till tertiary education, the CR took the view that excluding the Husband from educational decisions is not in the best interest of the children and potentially sends a wrong signal to the other parent, which discourages co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The CR recommended for the Wife to have care and control of all 3 children. The events since July 2021 to date had shown that the split care and control arrangements have not worked well in the children’s interest. There has been a lack of co-operation between the parents, and access has not been at a level where the siblings have regular contact time with each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The CR also recommended reasonable unsupervised access with detailed proposals set out in his report and other orders such as: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Counselling orders for the parents and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To ease the transition of the care and control to the Wife and the access arrangements, the CR is of the view that it would be helpful for the children to have a session with a Court Family Specialist to explain the orders that the Court would eventually make. Further consideration may also be given for the appointment of a Parenting Co-ordinator to ease the transition of access for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the outset, I wish to state that I agree with the CR and the Parties themselves that the siblings should not be separated. This is in line with the case authorities that where there are siblings involved, it is generally desirable to have them stay together (see for example, <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>). The split care and control arrangements, which were intended to be interim in nature, have indeed not worked well for the children. Because of the deep level of mistrust between their parents arising from the incidents in February/March 2024, the siblings have had no opportunity to interact with one another for more than 1 year and this has worked against their welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     From the CR’s report, it is clear that C2 and C3 are doing well under the Wife’s care and they share a warm and loving relationship with her. It is important to note particularly that in the CR’s interactions with C2 and C3, he did not observe or note any adverse comments made by C2 or C3 against the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In my view, this shows that the Wife had not triangulated C2 and C3 in her deep conflict with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The same cannot be said for the Husband. Since C1 started living with his father, there has been an increasing strain in the relationship between him and his mother. C1 blocked the Wife on Whatsapp and refused meaningful communication and access with her. There was also increasing hostility on the part of C1 towards the Wife, with him calling her “evil” and a “liar” in his text messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. He also made alarming statements to her about making her life miserable and bringing her to hell with him if she comes back to the matrimonial home and takes his siblings away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This contrasted with his more loving messages towards his mother and his willingness to go for access with her at the beginning of his time staying with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, it was stated by the High Court (at [29]) that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[29] Having said that, it is clear that switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent. This remedy would be most suitable in a situation in which the child begins to show animosity towards a parent with whom he previously had a loving relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although this is not a case of reversing final orders on care and control, I find the passage helpful to determine who should be granted final care and control of C1. In the present case, the Husband had either been deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between C1 and the Wife such that C1 now views the Wife negatively and puts the blame on her entirely for leaving the Husband and breaking apart the family. If the care and control arrangements during the interim period (which had gone on far longer than anticipated due to the delay in proceedings that are largely caused by the Husband having at least 8 different sets of counsel and harbouring hopes of reconciliation) are allowed to perpetuate, C1 is at great risk of losing one of the most important human relationships i.e. that of mother and son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am of the view that it is in the best interests of all 3 children to be placed under the care and control of the Wife and I so order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife and C1 would require a time for rebuilding their relationship without interference from the Husband and to this end, I am of the view that it would be helpful for there to be tiered access between the Husband and C1 in the following manner: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Phase 1: No access in the first 3 weeks from the time of handover<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Phase 2: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days for a period of 4 weeks;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Phase 3: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and supervised visitation for a period of 8 weeks (or more, if recommended by the relevant case worker);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Phase 4: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Phase 5: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband shall have video access for 20 minutes on alternate days to C2 and C3 and fixed access to C2 and C3 on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks and thereafter on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the physical access is not to commence until the supervised visitation sessions for the Husband and C1 have been completed and there has been some rebuilding of trust between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Parties and the children shall also be ordered to undergo counselling. C1, in particular, would require counselling to understand that there is no need for him to undertake the burden of aligning with his father in his parents’ dispute and for him to accept and come to terms with their marital breakdown. The parents would also need counselling to repair the trust between them and to learn how to co-parent moving forward. As recommended by the CR, I shall also order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent in the presence of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This leaves the relatively more straightforward issue of custody of the children. Although the Wife had sought for her to have the final say in the children’s educational matters, I see no reason to depart from precedents awarding joint custody to parents to promote co-parenting. Both Parties shall therefore have joint custody of all 3 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Before moving to the other issues, it remains for me to thank the CR, Mr Yap for his commendable efforts in trying to engage with the family, particularly with the Husband and C1 and producing a comprehensive report to assist the Court. Mr Yap has asked for the usual first-tier costs of $1,000 and I so order; the costs of $1,000 shall be borne by the Parties equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The matrimonial pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Parties have three joint assets, namely the matrimonial home and two joint bank accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I determine the size of the matrimonial pool as $<b>1,592,762.81</b> (not including assets of unknown value); the full list is found at [52]. I elaborate on the disputed assets below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife took the view that the market value of the matrimonial home is $1,308,000. This was based on the latest available transacted prices as at the time WA3 was prepared for a unit in the same block of flats.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s valuation of the matrimonial home is $1,200,000 as at the time he filed HA1. In HA2, he stated that in reply to the Wife’s then valuation of $1,238,888 in WA2, he would rely on the latest resale flat prices for the value of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Given that the Wife’s figure of $1,308,000 is the most updated, I shall use this as the market value of the matrimonial home. The outstanding loan as of May 2025 is $390,212.36. The value of the matrimonial home to be added to the matrimonial pool is thus $917,787.64.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">QR Pte Ltd and ST Property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Pte Ltd (“QR Company”). Notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar for the Husband to produce the necessary documents relating to this company, all that the Husband had produced is the ACRA profile dated 14 April 2022, an outdated profit and loss account statement for 2009 and 2010 and some bank statements of a Maybank account belonging to QR Company. The bank statements showed a balance of $247,424.42 as of 31 December 2022 with a depletion to $7,503.58 as of 30 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Given the paucity of documents, the Wife originally indicated in her affidavit that she wished for $247,424.42 to be notionally ascribed as the value of QR Company and added to the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> At the AM hearing on 19 December 2024, counsel for the Wife submitted that it is unclear whether the amount of $247,424.42 included the sale proceeds of a commercial property owned by QR Company (the “ST property”); to avoid double-accounting, he suggested that it may be fairer to add the latest and reduced amount in the bank account into the matrimonial pool and to account for the sale proceeds of the ST property separately. He further submitted that there is no other way to account for the value of QR Company, save to use the paid-up capital of $185,000 as reflected in the ACRA profile<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As for the ST property, it was submitted that the Husband had sold it at below market value while the Parties are in the midst of divorce proceedings and that the Court should ascribe a value of $350,000 to that property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband did not deny the sale of the ST property during the divorce proceedings but asserted that he had used its sale proceeds to repay his father a sum of $235,000 for loans that were extended to QR Company from time to time since 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Given that there is no documentation to show the extension of loans from the Husband’s father to QR Company and that the affidavit of the father, Mr [T] is self-serving in nature, I am minded to add the sale proceeds of the ST property into the matrimonial pool. As the Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Company<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> which owns the ST property and he appears to be able to transfer the monies to his father at will, I am not convinced that the Husband should be allowed to hide behind the corporate veil.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to the EdgeProp document produced by the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, there was only one unit in ST sold in September 2022. The sale price was reflected as $270,000. In HA2, the Husband alleged that the ST property was sold in “September 2022 for $243,424.03”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I am prepared to accept that there are costs and expenses involved in the sale and will therefore take $243,424.03 to be the net sale proceeds for the ST property. I am not convinced by the Wife’s argument that I ascribe $350,000 as the true market value of the ST property, given that there is only one other unit in ST sold for $350,000 in April 2022 and it is speculative as to whether the ST property belonging to QR Company would also have fetched the same price.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband asserted that the sum of $185,000 is the paid-up share capital and not the value of the company and objected to this characterisation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Since he had not produced <b><em>any documents</em></b> relating to the company which may show the true value of the company (especially given that it is a local company), it does not lie with him to object to this characterisation. The Court is left in the dark as to what the true value of the company is, and therefore has to agree with counsel for the Wife that there is no other objective way to put a value to the company. That being the case, I will add $185,000 notionally to the matrimonial pool as the value of QR Company. Since this $185,000 is supposed to represent the whole value of the company, I will not add the further bank balance of $7,503.58 in QR Company’s bank account to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mercedes Car</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband declared his ownership of a Mercedes car in HA1. This was bought on hire purchase after IJ was granted on 7 September 2022. In the circumstances, I would not consider the car as part of the matrimonial pool. Contrary to the Wife’s position, the car is not to be regarded as part of the matrimonial pool even though the car loan has since been fully discharged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Withdrawals from the Husband’s UOB account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife took issue with the Husband’s withdrawals from his UOB personal account amounting to $164,421.47. She has tabulated a breakdown in WA2.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Her table included sums that do not appear significant i.e. $80, $137, $200 etc. While most of the individual amounts do not appear significant, there are some substantial withdrawals which I am of the view that the Husband should account for: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     24 September 2018 - $13,818.05</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     16 November 2018 - $21,516.68</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     7 February 2019 - $21,840</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Husband did manage to show that he had deposited $21,840 into the joint account of the Parties on 7 February 2019 (the same day on which the sum was withdrawn from his UOB personal account).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, there was no documentary proof of how he had used the other two sums of $13,818.05 and $21,516.68 withdrawn in September and November 2018 respectively. Although his explanation was the same in respect of all three sums, only the sum of $21,840 was deposited in the joint account of the Parties. That being the case, I am of the view that he had not accounted satisfactorily for the other two sums and shall add the sum of $35,334.73 notionally back into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     For completeness, the sum of $85,355.99 reflected in the table tabulated by the Wife (though substantial) appears to be an accumulation of unposted debits. It would not therefore be fair to the Husband for him to have to account for this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Condominium in Malaysia </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband owns a condominium unit in Malaysia (referred to in this judgment as the “M Condo”). It is his case that this property was acquired before marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, it appears that although the M Condo is a pre-marital asset, it was enjoyed by the family as a holiday home or as a place to stay when they were in Kuala Lumpur. I am of the view that it falls within the definition of a matrimonial asset under section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), that being:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am strengthened in the view that the M Condo is a matrimonial asset by the fact that the property is still subject to a loan and has not been fully paid off before the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband had listed this property for sale; the Wife took objection to this given that the divorce proceedings are not yet over. The Wife valued the property at RM600,000 while the Husband valued it at RM400,000. I shall use RM500,000 as the value of the M Condo given that it is the average of the two values submitted by the Parties and within the sales price range found in the PropertyGuru document tendered by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     There appears to be a debt due to the bank in the amount of RM439,080.63 in relation to the M Condo<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. As such, the net value (which is to be added into the matrimonial pool) is RM 60,919.37 (S$18,629.78 – using an exchange rate of S$1 = RM 3.27<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s other companies </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband’s other companies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> are:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Re H – a company registered in the British Virgin Islands;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     AB Ltd – a forex brokerage company registered in Vanuatu;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     CD Ltd – a holding company registered in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband claims that the above companies are no longer active. They have no monies and/or assets and are presently being wound up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However, he has not produced any documents to substantiate his claims, notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar on 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The total value of these companies is therefore unknown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alliance Bank account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Alliance bank account was used by the Husband to pay the mortgage and other expenses for M Condo.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Similarly, no bank account statements were produced by the Husband, notwithstanding the discovery order of 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Monies alleged to be taken by the Wife when she left the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Husband alleged that the Wife took monies up to USD20,000 and S$30,000 from his safe when she left the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> However, such an allegation was not substantiated by the Husband. As such, the Court can have no regard to his allegation or consider it in the determination of the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Table of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

As the controlling mind of the companies which he had set up, he would have access to the financial documents to show the status and value of the companies. Yes, despite being ordered to produce such documents, he had failed, refused and/or neglected to do so to date. I note that nearly two years had elapsed since the order had been made. He had also not disclosed the bank statements for the Alliance Bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I agree that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband. Given that the values of such companies are unknown and there is no information as to the Alliance Bank account, the uplift approach should be applied: see W<em>RX v WRY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32094-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 851</a> at [39]-[40].

I decline to rely on her alleged debts/loans to adjust the final ratios; instead, I will look at the maintenance arrears owed under the interim maintenance orders to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As at the date of the Written Submissions, the Wife claimed that the Husband was in arrears of $19,000 for interim spousal maintenance and $16,750 for interim child maintenance. Counsel for the Wife informed at the hearing on 8 May 2025 that the Husband has continued not to pay under the interim maintenance orders since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The total amount of arrears would therefore be $45,770 (including month of June 2025). This is equivalent to about 2.9% of the matrimonial pool. I grant the Wife an uplift of 2.9% to account for the maintenance arrears; no further arrears as of June 2025 shall be owing by the Husband to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Final adjustment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The final ratio as adjusted between the Parties is therefore 48.4: 51.6 in favour of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is thus $770,897.20 while that of the Husband is $821,865.61.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Wife had originally asked for the Husband’s share in the matrimonial home to be transferred to her. However, she now takes the view that she is unable to take over the Husband’s share and is applying for the matrimonial home to be sold in the open market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Wife shall be at liberty to close both the joint accounts and retain the monies within. With these sums accounted for, the following will thus be each Party’s respective share in the matrimonial home: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"50%\"><col width=\"50%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$686,309.66</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$231,477.98</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">74.8%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">25.2%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The matrimonial home is to be sold on the open market within 6 months of the Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 74.8% to the Wife and 25.2% to the Husband after the payment of the outstanding housing loan, the HDB resale levy (if any) and costs and expenses incidental and related to the sale of the property. The requisite CPF refunds in accordance with the applicable CPF Rules and Regulations to the Parties’ respective CPF accounts shall be made from the Parties’ respective share of the sale proceeds in the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Given the Husband’s conduct in these proceedings and his lingering hope of a reconciliation, the Wife is concerned that the Husband would delay the sale of the matrimonial home. I am minded to order that the Wife have sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home. She is to consult the Husband on the sale price of the matrimonial home but in the event of any disagreement, the Wife shall have the final say on the sale price. The mortgage payments shall be borne by the Parties equally before the matrimonial home is sold. The Registrar/Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts shall also be empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to the sale of the matrimonial home on behalf of either Party should either Party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the Party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Wife has asked for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in the interim period before the matrimonial home is sold. This is so that she can reside at the matrimonial home with the 3 children. Given that she has been granted the sole conduct of sale of the matrimonial property and the care and control of all the children, I do not think this is an unreasonable request. I therefore order that the Husband shall vacate the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> without C1 by 12 July 2025 giving the Wife exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home with the 3 children. I accept the suggestion of counsel for the Wife and order that the handover of C1 to the Wife shall be at the matrimonial home on the date set for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home; this will cause the least disruption to C1, who can continue to stay at the matrimonial home until it is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Parties shall retain all other assets in their sole names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Maintenance for the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The Wife has asked for continued spousal maintenance at $1,000 per month. However, considering her share of the matrimonial assets and her relatively young age, I am of the view that there should not be an order of maintenance that is aimed at creating a life-long dependency on the Husband (see for example, <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a>, at [31]). Instead, I shall award her a lump sum maintenance of $18,000 calculated by multiplying the monthly amount of $1,000 by a period of 18 months. This approach provides the Wife with transitional support while encouraging financial independence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Husband is to pay the Wife the lump sum maintenance from his share of the sale proceeds. If there is a shortfall, the Wife may enforce in the usual manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 4: Maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Wife

update some of the expenses. Since C3 is now in Primary School, he would require pocket monies (at $50), school bus expenses (at $100) and ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20) but not milk powder or diapers anymore. There would also not be any child care fees but school fees for C3 (at $7).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     C2 will also not require milk powder but should have ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     For transport expenses, I am of the view that they should be pegged at the price of a monthly concessionary pass for primary and secondary students, that being $39 and $49 respectively.

Since I am ordering the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in order for the Wife and the children to move in and for the mortgage loans to be paid equally in the meantime before the matrimonial home is sold, I am of the view that the accommodation expenses of the children should only be factored in as part of the maintenance order when the matrimonial home is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I turn now to the incomes and earning capacity of the Parties. I had earlier made a finding on the earning capacity of the Wife to be approximately between $2,200 to $2,700 per month in the interim maintenance application. Notwithstanding that the Wife had resigned from her employment as a Customer Service Officer and is currently self-employed with the assertion that her business has yet to generate sufficient profit to provide her with a sustainable income, I am of the view that for the purpose of this AM hearing, her earning capacity remains at between $2,200 and $2,700 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife submitted that the Husband had attempted to paint himself in poor financial straits, alleging that he owes debts to multiple parties (including his parents). The Wife disbelieved this and submitted that the Husband’s earning capacity is in the region of $12,000 per month. The nature of the business that the Husband was the controlling mind of were sophisticated in nature, operating in forex trade. Coupled with the extremely comfortable lifestyle that she and the children had enjoyed up until the breakdown of the marriage, it was her submission that the Husband was earning more than what he had disclosed in his affidavits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She also contended that the notices of assessment produced by the Husband for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2024 are not a truthful representation of the Husband’s actual income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband averred that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in failed business ventures and his loss of employment. He took on multiple jobs, including work as a safe distancing ambassador and a chef apprentice. He became an M &amp; E Assistant Project Manager in October 2021, earning a monthly salary of $4,000 for about 3 months before resigning to join another company as a Senior Engineer (Electrical) in January 2022. He was earning a monthly gross salary of $5,800 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He resigned from this job in February 2023 due to a dispute over project budget and liquidity issues in the company and claims to be unemployed ever since while receiving financial help from his parents. He had taken courses and sought employment opportunities, but none were successful.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Husband’s last drawn salary was $5,800 per month. I accept that he was also a businessman and had a side income from his businesses. I am unable to make a finding that he had earned as much from his businesses as from his employment, given that a full-time job will require his time and resources. As such, I decline to accept the Wife’s submission that the Husband was earning in the region of $12,000 per month. In my view, although the Husband had claimed that he had no employment and no income since February 2023, the Court can take into account his earning capacity, which shall be assessed to be about $8,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Given the differing levels of earning capacity, it would be fair for the Husband to bear 75% of the children’s expenses. I therefore order that the Husband pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children with effect from 12 July 2025: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,100 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $930 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $830 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After the matrimonial home is sold, the Husband shall pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,400 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $1,270 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $1,170 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     All maintenance payments shall be deposited into the Wife’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Wife is represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. Her counsel has indicated that he would be asking for costs on behalf of the Director of Legal Aid. Counsel for the Parties shall provide the Court with their submissions on costs (capped at 10 pages) within 10 working days from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This set of divorce proceedings has gone on for far too long and both Parties had suffered immensely and gone through much emotional turmoil. It is regrettable that the Husband had not come to terms with the marital breakdown and at different junctures of the proceedings, his various counsel had raised his hope of reconciliation. The Husband had raged against the Court, counsel for the Wife and even his own former counsel for “speeding up” the divorce and breaking apart his family. I must emphasise to the Husband that no one involved in these proceedings takes any satisfaction in the dissolution of a marriage, and the protracted duration of these proceedings clearly demonstrates that there has been no undue haste.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The profound mistrust between the Parties has had serious consequences, most notably on their children.

The applicant, who was 22 years old, is the daughter of the respondent. I shall refer to them as the “Daughter” and the “Father”. The Daughter was subject to family violence from the Mother as a child (though she said that the Father had also perpetrated violence against her, which he denied) and was placed in a safe home. The Daughter had then returned to stay in her parents’ home. However, the home was due to be sold and the Daughter would not have a place to stay. Further, she was attending university and had to work while studying to make ends meet. Against this background, she sought maintenance from her Father. I ordered the Father to pay her a modest sum of $500 a month. The Father has since filed an appeal against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       While parties had not tendered any official records, it was not disputed that sometime in 2015, the Daughter was placed in a care home by the Child Protection Service, where she stayed at until 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In 2020, a personal protection order was granted in favour of the Daughter against her mother, on the application of a person appointed by MSF.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Daughter was an undergraduate at a local university, having matriculated in 2023. According to her, she was staying in at university accommodation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father had obtained a divorce against the mother, which was registered in the Syariah Court in Singapore in 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> While neither party had tendered the ancillary orders made by the Syariah Court, it was not disputed that the matrimonial home would be sold. The Father also did not dispute the Daughter’s evidence that following the sale of the matrimonial flat, neither of her parents would provide her accommodation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Daughter’s case was that the Father has failed to maintain her and that she had to work to support herself since she was 14.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She sought maintenance of $1,800 a month. Her big-ticket expenses were rent ($728), food and groceries ($550) and utilities ($160).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father did not challenge the Daughter’s list of expenses. The Father also did not dispute that he had not been paying maintenance for the Daughter. His written case was that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Year 2015 [the Daughter] intent to leave parents’ house and wanted to stay with one of her friend who stay at CONDO, in order to enjoy freedom life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I did talk to her that time and told her that if she wants to do so she has to be adopted by the friend parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">After that we will not [bear] any responsibility of her and she will not be entitle for any asset from parent. She replies that she do not want anything from father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       He also gave evidence that he was not working.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The issues are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the Father has failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the Daughter; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     if so, what is the quantum of maintenance that the Court should order the Father to pay the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The duty of parents to maintain their children is set out at section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The duty does not perpetuate for life and ordinary ends when the child turns 21. However, a Court may order maintenance to be paid to a child above 21 in some specific circumstances, including when: “the child is or will be or … would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment …, whether or not while in gainful employment”: section 69(5)(<em>c</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The quantum of reasonable maintenance is determined by having regard all relevant circumstances including the earning capacity of the parent and the standard of living enjoyed by the child: section 69(4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Father had failed to provide reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father’s case appears to be that the Daughter had chosen to run away from home and in a sense “waived” her right to be maintained. Leaving aside the legal issue of whether a minor can waive her right to maintenance, the Father’s case is not even supported by the facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father accepted that around 2015, the “following week” after the Daughter had purported run away, “Child protection officer then send her to child home and she continue to stay there until 2019”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It is difficult to see why the Child Protection Service would place a child in care if the Daughter had run away to pursue “freedom”. That family violence was committed against the Daughter was confirmed by the PPO that was subsequently granted in her favour. Further, in Syariah Court proceedings, the Father had also filed an affidavit accusing the Daughter’s mother of physically abusing her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I thus did not hesitate to reject the Father’s argument had the Daughter had chosen to leave the family home and thus “waived” her right to maintenance”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father also claimed that he was not working and thus could not afford to pay maintenance. It is trite that beyond the actual income of a parent, the earning capacity of a parent is also relevant: s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. His IRAS Notice of Assessment of Years 2023 showed that his employment income was $ 26,701, while for 2024 it was $28,918.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father explained that his job was project-based and the last project ended in December 2024.

He also did not think that he should provide for the Daughter’s education, since it was her decision to pursue her studies. However, these are not legitimate reasons to refuse to pay maintenance. In any event, it was not even borne out by the evidence that the Daughter had abandoned him for “a better life”. As explained above, the Daughter had good reason to leave the house – she was the victim of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Further, the Father was 53 years old and there was no evidence that he was medically unfit to work. I thus found that the Father failed to pay reasonable maintenance to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now turn to the sum of maintenance that the Father should be ordered to pay.

However, he accepted that he had not tendered evidence to substantiate this argument.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I had also considered whether the Daughter should also seek maintenance from her mother as well. To be clear, this argument was not raised by the Father but it was one which I thought was relevant. Nevertheless, the Father gave evidence that “I was the only single working person and maintaining the family.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The clear inference that the daughter’s mother was not working during the marriage and hence it would not be reasonable to expect her to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Thus, taking into account the Daughter’s needs, the Father’s ability to pay, including his personal expenses, earning capacity, past salary and his need to maintain another daughter, I found that it was reasonable for him to pay $500 a month in maintenance to the Daughter, and I so ordered. To be clear, it was not even necessary to scrutinise the Daughter’s list of expenses because $500 is already a very modest sum which would not even cover the Daughter’s accommodation expenses. It should also be noted that the Father’s obligation to pay would also cease by operation of law once the Daughter graduates. Considering all the circumstances, the sum ordered is, if anything, on the low side.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>PPO XXX/2020, granted in SS XXXX of 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 2 and 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at pp 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at p 90 (her Mother’s reply affidavit responding to the Father’s allegations).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 23 and 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 14 and 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Certified Transcript pp 18 to 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 12 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Contested Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour – Section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2025-06-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3557 of 2022","title":"WPF v WPG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 67","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33403-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff-in-person","Defendant-in-person"],"timestamp":"2025-06-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>WPF v WPG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WPF <em>v</em> WPG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33403-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 67</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Husband, for his own reasons, contested the divorce strenuously. Much delay was caused by his purported heart condition, which saw repeated adjournments at first instance and on multiple appeals. As the Husband refused to proceed with cross-examination during the contested divorce hearing, I directed for an exchange of questions and answers to be conducted in writing, and proceeded to grant interim judgment on 5 March 2025. He now appeals against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties were married in 2009. They have two children, a female aged 15 and a male aged 4 at the date on which I granted interim judgment in the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife claimed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably due to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Some background to her prayers is provided to provide the context for the events that have transpired. In the Wife’s prayers for ancillary orders, she asks for sole custody of the children, with supervised access to the Husband every alternate Saturday. With regards to financial matters, she requests that the matrimonial home (a HDB flat in Ang Mo Kio) be transferred to her with no CPF refunds or cash consideration, and that their car be transferred to the Husband. No spousal or child maintenance was requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s Pleadings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife pleaded the following particulars with regard to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had alleged she was having an affair and demanded a paternity test to prove that their younger child was his, which allegation was eventually proven to be wrong;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had applied domestic violence against her on 23 October 2019 (kicked her stomach and pushed her against the window), on 4 February 2021 (held her neck and pushed her against wall), and on 29 November 2021 when he attempted to break down the master bedroom door and subsequently destroyed two CCTVs in the master bedroom;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He had harassed and humiliated her by entering into altercations before her friends and making a report against her to the hospital where she worked;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He had pawned her jewellery and demanded money to pay for his car loan, and had failed to support the family since 2018;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     He had tried to forcefully take their young baby away on 1 February 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_f\"></a>(f)     He had continually threatened to report her to the authorities for alleged tax violations that he claimed would send her to prison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife went on to provide particulars of how the marriage proceeded towards divorce. She had filed an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Husband in January 2022. The Husband then requested for two church members to help them mediate for reconciliation in the marriage on 5 February 2022. This however ended in failure and another altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the parties then signed a Mutual Agreement on 16 March 2022 witnessed by a solicitor, Mr Foo Ho Chew of H C Law Practice (“Mr Foo”). The Mutual Agreement is exhibited in the Wife’s supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief (“AEIC”). Under the agreement, the Wife agreed to withdraw her PPO application, but if the Husband breached the good behaviour clauses contained therein, the divorce would proceed by consent with the HDB property being transferred to the Wife and her two children, in exchange for which she would compensate him $50,000, with no child maintenance required thereafter. On the basis of that agreement, Wife withdrew her PPO application SS 199/2022 on 22 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       However, the relationship broke down soon after with another altercation near the lawyer’s premises on 28 March 2022. The matter came to a head when the Husband allegedly breached isolation policy during the Covid-19 pandemic and came home despite being Covid-19 positive on 18 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       According to the Wife, parties have not been living together since October 2019. Wife asserts that Husband would only come home whenever he wants money, did not contribute financially and instead collected rental from the two rooms that were rented out in their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s Pleadings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In his defence, the Husband denies all incidents prior to 5 February 2022. He denied harassing her at her workplace thereafter and said he spoke to her boss only to ask for her withdrawal of the PPO application. As for the agreement on 16 March 2022, the Husband avers that the settlement agreement was only in relation to the PPO application. He also denies the various incidents thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In sum, the Husband denies having acted unreasonably towards the Wife and asks for the divorce application to be dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Striking Out Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband’s next step in the proceedings was to file SUM 734/2023 to strike out the exhibited mutual agreement from the record. This was heard on 12 June 2023, and dismissed by Assistant Registrar (“AR”) Keziah Simon. He claimed the agreement was invalid as he had received no legal advice, its contents were not translated to him in Mandarin, and he had signed it under pressure due to the Wife’s pending PPO application. The AR found that this was not the correct forum to set aside the Mutual Agreement, as it was a private agreement that was not the subject of a court order. She also declined to strike out the Wife’s pleadings in respect of the Mutual Agreement, as it could not be said to prejudice the fair trial of the divorce. Its inclusion merely served to put the Husband on notice of the Wife’s case in relation to the divorce and ancillary matters. Accordingly, SUM 734/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband then filed RA 11/2023 against the dismissal, which was heard by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat. At the hearing, the Husband alleged that the Wife had conspired with his lawyer Mr Foo to deceive him into signing the Mutual Agreement. He also asked the court to rule on the reasonableness of the Mutual Agreement pursuant to section 96 of the Women’s Charter 1961. The court found his reliance on section 96 to be misplaced, as the issues raised in challenge related to the validity of the agreement. Accordingly, the court held that the question of reasonableness should only arise for consideration during the ancillary stage to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband appealed further to the High Court in RAS XX/2023, but this was dismissed by Teh Hwee Hwee J on 29 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 9 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Following the Husband’s failed attempt to strike out the Mutual Agreement, the contested divorce proceeding was fixed for hearing on 13 August 2024. However, no substantive hearing was held until 9 September 2024, due to three adjournments that were granted on the basis of the Husband’s alleged heart condition. The details of these various adjournments can be found in my written grounds for the recusal application that the Husband was later to file in SUM 3015/2024, which was prepared pursuant to his further appeal in RAS 14/2024 (see <em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [14]-[19]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The contested divorce hearing finally proceeded on 9 September 2024. It had been moved from an in-person to a remote hearing, in deference to the Husband’s alleged heart condition, so that he could be at liberty to call for or arrange medical assistance if needed. At the start of the hearing, the Husband protested against its commencement, revealing that he had <em>pre-ordered</em> an ambulance some four to five days before the hearing to take him away during the hearing. Nevertheless, as he was able to cogently advance his position with regard to his medical condition and answer the court’s questions, I allowed the Plaintiff to proceed with her examination-in-chief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the hearing before me, the Wife affirmed the facts averred to in her Statement of Particulars, which I summarise as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 23 October 2019, the Husband accused the Wife of having an affair with her degree classmate RG. He lost his temper and kicked her in the stomach, held her by the neck and pushed her forcefully against a window without a grill, which made her fear for her life. A police report was made by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In January 2020, under constant demand by the Husband for a paternity test on the allegation that the younger child was not his, the Wife finally agreed to a prenatal paternity test, which proved that the child did indeed belong to the Husband. She also alleged that he had prevented her from going on holiday to China, and had earlier told her friends and church members that the baby was not his, causing her humiliation, embarrassment and stress. When she learned that the Husband had pawned her jewellery and used the money to pay for the paternity test, she made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 April and 1 May 2020, she alleged that he asked for $100 from her, called her office and threatened to make her bedbound. She made a further police report as she was concerned about her children if something should happen to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 6 July 2020, the Husband allegedly followed the Wife and her daughter to a coffeeshop near their residence, asking money for the car insurance, shouting loudly, scolding her while pointing his finger at her, and threatening that he would send messages or videos of her allegedly having an extramarital affair to her workplace Facebook page. This left her emotionally distressed as it was a crowded premise and she was heavily pregnant at the time. The following day, the Husband allegedly shouted at her again, leading the Wife to be distressed and in pain. She delivered her younger son later that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 2 January 2021, the Husband allegedly drove to the Wife’s friend’s home while she was there and created a disturbance. The Husband informed her other friends not to contact her anymore, or he would otherwise make trouble for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 4 February 2021, when the Wife kept silent in response to his request that she pay the monthly car loan, he allegedly held her neck and pushed her to the wall in the master bedroom, threatening her and accusing her of having a relationship with RG. Thereafter, the Wife was informed that the Husband had called her office to request to meet up with her boss, and had also called her close friends. His behaviour placed her in fear that he would harass her by airing their family issues with her friends and colleagues. Accordingly, the Wife applied for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In September 2021, the Wife saw the Husband having a meal with another lady, who told her that the Husband had treated her to the meal. The Wife was upset that he would treat another to a meal when he had not supported the family since 2018. She thereafter requested the car to be returned to her but this was refused, which led to her filing a further police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 29 November 2021, the Wife claimed that the Husband again accused her about the alleged affair with RG and threatened to report her for tax offences. He kicked the master bedroom door continuously and destroyed the CCTV in the master bedroom, which led to her calling the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 30 November 2021, the Wife claimed the Husband followed her around until she was forced to make a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 24 January 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband called the hospital in her daughter’s presence and asked where to make a report against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_k\"></a>(k)     On 28 January 2022, the Husband allegedly pointed his finger at the Wife and made his usual allegations until she had to lock the master bedroom door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_l\"></a>(l)     On 29 January 2022, he came back to the house, and followed her around the house, until she had to call the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_m\"></a>(m)     On 1 February 2022, the Wife alleged that the Husband tried to take her young son from her, and followed her around outdoors, where he again tried to take the son away from their helper. When the Wife stopped him, the Husband allegedly pushed her very hard over her shoulder. This led to her calling the police for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_n\"></a>(n)     On 2 February 2022, the Husband allegedly told the helper to leave the house and sat in the master bedroom, which made the Wife and daughter sleep in the helper’s bedroom. The police were called again for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_o\"></a>(o)     On 3 February 2022, the Husband allegedly accused the Wife of having an affair again, grabbed her wrist forcefully, and only left when the helper made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_p\"></a>(p)     On 5 February 2022, the Wife agreed to meet the Husband’s two church friends to mediate. When she refused to withdraw her PPO application, he starting shouting and pointed his finger at her in front of the church friends, accusing her of stealing another person’s husband, and threatening to take the children away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_q\"></a>(q)     On 7 February 2022, the Wife stated that her boss texted her, as her Husband had reported her to the hospital where she worked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_r\"></a>(r)     On 16 March 2022, the parties signed a Mutual Agreement, on the basis of which the Wife withdrew her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_s\"></a>(s)     On 25 March 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband again shouted at her and scolded her while pointing a finger at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_t\"></a>(t)     On 26 March 2022, the Husband allegedly again accused the Wife of having an affair with RG, and threatened to report her to the authorities for tax offences which would result in her imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_u\"></a>(u)     On 28 March 2022, after consulting with her lawyer, the Wife alleged that the Husband followed her around, again accusing her of being a shameless woman and threatening to let others know what she had done on social media. While passing a coffee shop, he pulled her bag over her back harshly to get her to discuss with him at the coffee shop. He then followed her to the bus stop, while continually harassing her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_v\"></a>(v)     On 29 March 2022, the Husband again intercepted and harassed her at the bus stop in front of passers-by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_w\"></a>(w)     On 28 June 2022, he came back to the matrimonial home, lost his temper, and again threatened to report the Wife to her workplace and IRAS, in front of her tenants and her children. She called the police thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_x\"></a>(x)     On 17 July 2022, the Wife claimed he came back to the matrimonial home with Covid-19, placing her and the children at risk, rather than submitting himself to quarantine under prevailing the prevailing rules of isolation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife had also tendered video and voice recordings (with accompanying transcripts) in relation to the incidents on the following dates:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     3 February 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     26 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     28 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     29 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     28 June 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_f\"></a>(f)     17 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In her supplementary affidavit, she further exhibited the Mutual Agreement which she claimed parties had entered into on 16 March 2022, which was signed by both parties and witnessed by Mr Foo. I note that handwritten amendments were made to clauses 6(c) and (d), to specify for joint custody, and also to make clear that the $50,000 compensation was contingent on there being no breach of clauses 1 and 3. The amendments were signed by all three parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In summary, the Wife claimed that she was drained after four years of emotional torture from and physical aggression by the husband, with whom she had not lived together since October 2019. She also pointed out that he made no financial contribution to the household, while collecting rental from the two rooms which were tenanted out in the matrimonial home. He would also appear to make trouble in the house whenever he needed money, and his actions had resulted in the loss of her circle of friends and embarrassment before her colleagues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At the conclusion of the Wife’s evidence-in-chief, the Husband refused to cross-examine her on account of his alleged poor health. After repeated requests for him to proceed, I took his continued refusal to mean that he had no questions in cross-examination and directed him to proceed with his evidence-in-chief. The Husband then proceeded to testify that he was “conned” into singing the Mutual Agreement. I informed him that it was no point disputing the Mutual Agreement at this stage as it was immaterial to the issue of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Whether the Mutual Agreement was valid and carried any weight would be germane to the ancillary proceedings. At this point, the ambulance that the Husband had pre-ordered arrived and the hearing was terminated prematurely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I would note at this point that the Husband had in his AEIC denied the alleged incidents on 23 October 2019, November 2019, 30 April 2019, 1 May 2020, 6 July 2020, 2 January 2021, 4 February 2021, August – September 2021, 29 November 2021, 30 November 2021, 24 January 2022, 29 January 2022, 1 February 2022 and 2 February 2022. He claimed that these were bare assertions, and as to any police reports made, no action was taken. He also submitted in his affidavit that incidents occurring more than six months before the filing of the Writ for divorce (dated 4 August 2022) should not be relied upon. I note that this position arises out of his erroneous reading of section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (which is now rephrased as the new section 95A(3) that came into force after the filing of the writ). Section 95(6) states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of subsection 3(b) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The above provision has no relevance in the present case because parties had essentially ceased to live together since October 2019, and all the alleged incidents of unreasonable behaviour had taken place after that date. There is therefore no question of the Wife having acquiesced to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour by continuing to reside with him for more than six months after the fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In his AEIC, the Husband also provided his explanations for the series of incidents raised in the Wife’s Statement of Particulars. In summary, his explanations were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 5 February 2022, during a mediation session held with his two church friends, he did not lose his temper, point or yell at the Plaintiff, and the mediation was intended to help restore their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 7 February 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff through her boss at the hospital where she worked, and explained that his intent was to seek the boss’ help to persuade her to withdraw her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 16 March 2022, he claimed that he was unduly influenced by the Wife to sign the mutual agreement, did not receive independent legal advice, and did not understand is terms as he was English illiterate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 25 March 2022, he denied pointing his fingers at the Wife in the master bedroom, or yelling or scolding her in front of their daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 26 March 2022, he explained that he had told the Wife that the settlement agreement only applied to the PPO application, and should have no effect on the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 28 March 2022, he explained that he had confronted the Wife to tell her it was not right of her to use Mr Foo as he had approached the said counsel first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On 29 March 2022, he denied telling the Wife she was evil, that she would go to prison, or that he had shouted at the Plaintiff. He claimed they just walked and talked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 28 June 2022, he claimed he did not threaten to report the Wife to her employer or to IRAS for tax offences if she refused to give him monies to pay the car insurance premium. He also explained he had simply removed the CCTV camera as it was faulty and had not forcibly removed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 17 July 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff in relation to asking her for financial help for his car insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 17 and 18 July 2022, he denied that he had returned to the flat with Covid-19, and claimed that he just had a normal flu bug.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 30 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     After the first hearing date of 9 September 2024 was disrupted due to the planned arrival of paramedics, the Husband filed a recusal application (SUM 3015/2024) against me. On the resumption of the hearing on 30 September 2024, I heard and dismissed the recusal application. However, the Husband refused to proceed thereafter with the divorce proceedings, on account of his health condition. I therefore directed that parties exchange a list of questions to be asked of the other party via correspondence copied to the court by 7 October 2024, and that if no further questions were tendered, I would take it that there would be no questions to be raised in cross-examination. I further directed that each party file their final reply affidavits, to be limited to answers to the questions raised, by 18 October 2024. The hearing of the contested divorce was then adjourned to 22 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In making these unusual directions, I note that under the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”), the court has the ultimate discretion to decide whether a party is to be orally cross-examined at trial. In particular, Rule 590(1) of the FJR specifies that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">590.—(1)    Without prejudice to the generality of rule 589, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    evidence-in-chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>unless the Court otherwise orders</b> or the parties to the action otherwise agree —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>such a witness must attend trial for cross-examination</b>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Further, Rule 591 allows the Court to give evidence of any particular fact by a statement on oath:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">591.—(1)    Without prejudice to rule 590, the Court may, at or before the trial of any action, order that evidence of any particular fact shall be given at the trial in such manner specified by the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In particular, the Court may order <b>that evidence of any particular fact may be given at the trial —</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)     <b>by statement on oath of information or belief</b>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    by the production of documents or entries in books;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    by copies of documents or entries in books; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in the case of a fact which is or was a matter of common knowledge either generally or in a particular place, by the production of a specified newspaper which contains a statement of that fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I considered that given the manner in which the Husband repeatedly replied on medical certificates in relation to his heart condition to brazenly delay or avoid court proceedings, the only way to move the matter forward was to convert oral cross-examination to the written process described, since the Husband was simply unwilling to cross-examine the Wife nor allow her to cross-examine him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I would add that it was essential to take this case firmly in hand as by September 2024, more than two years had passed since the filing of the divorce writ. It would be an abuse of process to allow the Wife to be continually stymied by the Husband’s refusal to proceed with court testimony, in spite of every accommodation being made to allow him to participate remotely from a clinic or hospital if need be. I also note that allowing the Husband to write and respond to questions in his own time outside of trial would surely not tax his constitution. To date, he has not complained of any inability to file documents, and indeed has pursued appeals relentlessly during periods covered by his medical certificates. Nor would he suffer any prejudice by way of written exchange, since any issue which merited closer examination could have been followed up with a request for further questions and responses in writing. For these reasons, I was of the view that proceeding by way of written questions and answers would be the most expeditious and fair way to move forward given the Husband’s refusal to proceed with oral cross-examination in the contested divorce hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Written Cross-Examination Questions and the Wife’s Reply</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Both parties filed their cross-examination questions to the other on 7 October 2024. However, only the Wife replied with her reply affidavit dated 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the Wife’s reply, she made the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mutual Agreement was initiated by the Husband to get her to withdraw the PPO application, and he had pressured her to enter into the proposal. The lawyer Mr Foo was appointed by her Husband, and she had no prior contact or discussion with Mr Foo prior to its signing. Neither had she paid for Mr Foo’s services. She also denied that the Mutual Agreement was intended as a warning, and that they would reconcile after its signing. She subsequently employed a lawyer from PKWA Law Practice to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, she pointed out that Mr Foo was fluent in Mandarin and that the Husband had received independent legal advice from his counsel before entering into the Mutual Agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     She denied that the discussion with two church members on 5 February 2024 was for the purposes of reconciliation, and that the Husband’s request was for her to withdraw the PPO application against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 14 February 2024, the Husband had sent her an email in relation to his report against her to the hospital at which she was employed. The email reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Thank you (XXX Hospital) for a thorough internal investigation… I have evidence on my side that some of the actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) have seriously damaged the reputation of (XXX Hospital). If these actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) were published on the electronic network of mass communication, if they were published in mass media, the nurse manager (Wife) is going to jail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In 2024, the Husband had promised to send the car to the scrapyard by 12 January 2024 but failed to do so. He instead demanded that the Wife pay $5,274.69 that was owed by him to the car dealer. She had no choice but to make this payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To date, the Husband has failed to file a reply in response to the Wife’s cross-examination questions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I would also point out that the Husband was not labouring under the misapprehension that his intervening appeal filed on 7 October 2024 against my dismissal of his recusal application operated as a stay of proceedings. I had reminded the Husband of this point at the hearing of 30 September 2024, and the Husband had actually filed a separate application for a stay pending appeal in SUM 3232/2024, which was dismissed by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat on 23 October 2024. Nevertheless, in the interest of natural justice, the hearing of the contested divorce was adjourned to allow the Husband’s appeal regarding the recusal application to be heard. After two fixtures on 19 November 2024 and 11 December 2024 before the High Court were adjourned, again on account of the Husband’s heart condition, the appeal was heard and dismissed on 28 February 2025 by Choo Han Teck J.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 5 March 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the reconvened hearing of the contested divorce on 5 March 2025, I considered that the Husband had had more than four months since the deadline of 18 October 2024 to file his reply affidavit. I could only take his failure to do so as a clear indication that he did not wish to respond to the Plaintiff’s questions in cross-examination. Indeed, from his conduct through the course of these proceedings, it did not seem that the Husband had any serious intent to contest these proceedings, apart from causing incontrovertible delay and inconvenience to the Wife. With regard to his explanation that his purported medical condition necessitated the delay, I repeat the observations made in my grounds of decision in the recusal application that the court has provided sufficient accommodation to his medical condition (<em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, every reasonable accommodation has been made in view of the Defendant’s medical issues, including multiple adjournments and a shift in the modality of hearing, first to a remote hearing, and finally to an exchange of questions and answers by way of affidavit. There is no indication that the Defendant is unable to pen thoughts to paper to further his case, and these special directions have been given to move proceedings along in a manner that minimises any risk posed to the Defendant’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I further note that it had at this point been 2 ½ years since the writ had been filed on 4 August 2022, and an immense amount of latitude that had been granted to the Plaintiff at both the Family and the High Court on account of his alleged medical condition. This contested divorce hearing had itself been adjourned nine times over ten fixtures on 13 August 2024, 27 August 2024, 9 September 2024, 18 September 2024, 26 September 2024, 30 September 2024, 22 October 2024, 2 December 2024, 2 January 2025, and 5 March 2024. As mentioned, special arrangements had been made to ensure that proceedings could move forward while giving the Husband the option of arranging for medical assistance as needed during the hearing. Instead, the Husband had cynically taken advantage of this latitude by scheduling an emergency pickup by paramedics some four to five days in advance of the first hearing date of 9 September 2024. There can, to my mind, be no clearer indication of his intent to thwart and delay these contested divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As I had observed in my written grounds for the recusal application, justice delayed would be justice denied. In family matters, this adage carries even greater weight as the welfare of parties and their children may be irrevocably prejudiced by lengthened proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Indeed, as a general principle of litigation, once trial dates are fixed, the expeditious resolution of the matter before the court is paramount. It is not for a party to dictate timelines by its own default. This was recognised by the High Court in <em>Affert Resources Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v Industries Chimiques du Senegal and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30495-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 305</a>, where the appellant had disregarded multiple court deadlines backed by an unless order to file its expert affidavit. In that case, Goh Yihan J dismissed the application for an extension of time to file the affidavit, which would have necessitated an adjournment of the trial, noting at [37] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is the respondents’ prerogative to want the matter to be determined as expeditiously as possible. Indeed, it is also the court’s prerogative for the expeditious determination of the matter in order to uphold the due administration of civil justice, where a party cannot hog a court’s time and resources for adjudication. Therefore, the appellant should not be allowed to dictate timelines by its own default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This sentiment finds expression in English authority as well, in the case of <em>Wallersteiner v Moir</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/12194-E-M.xml')\">[1974] 1 WLR 991</a>. The plaintiff in that matter (Dr Wallersteiner) had his claim dismissed for want of prosecution, and judgment was entered on a counterclaim against him, as he had delayed proceedings by failing to file his pleadings for 12 months. On appeal, Lord Denning MR upheld the decision, emphasising that intentional prolonging of proceedings undermined the course of justice and would bring the legal system into disrepute. The learned judge noted at page 1017 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The evidence shows that Dr. Wallersteiner has grossly abused the process of the courts. He has staved off the hour of judgment by one shift after another. He has fabricated documents in an attempt to deceive the courts. Even now he would seek more delay so as to put in a defence. If it were given to him, the case might go on for ever. It would so exhaust &quot;courage, finances, patience, hope&quot; that those who have lost their money would say of this court: “Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than go there.” I know there has been no trial of Dr, Wallersteiner. These proceedings are only interlocutory. But, even so, something must be done now. We must brook no further delay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In a similar vein, the present proceedings for an interim order for divorce should not be delayed any further. On the basis of the pleadings and affidavits filed, as well as oral evidence given at the earlier hearings, and the Wife’s reply affidavit to the Husband’s written cross-examination questions, I considered that there was ample evidence to proceed to decide the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     At the close of the hearing on 5 March 2025, I found that there was incontrovertible evidence of harassment by the Husband of the Wife over the course of the marriage in the years leading up to the filing of the divorce on 4 August 2022. The Husband had clearly threatened the Wife in relation to reporting her for alleged tax offences. He had seen through his threats to air their grievances to her friends, colleagues and her boss, the latter of which was clearly evidenced in his email of 14 February 2024. His behaviour had resulted in an investigation that had taken place at her workplace, which would have caused the Wife considerable embarrassment and humiliation. Further, the Husband’s explanation that he had written to the Wife’s boss merely to seek his help to get her to withdraw the PPO is specious and flies in the face of reason. There is no justification whatsoever for raising their familial dispute in the workplace context, except to humiliate her and pressure her to bend to his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I further observe that in the course of their disagreements, both at home and in public, the Husband’s tone had been consistently threatening and aggressive. This was evident in the various audio and video recordings tendered by the Wife. The numerous police reports made by the Wife also speak to the clear breakdown of their relationship in the years prior to the filing of her writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Financially, the Husband had also not provided for the household for many years, and despite taking the rental proceeds for the rental of two spare rooms in the matrimonial home, he continually badgered the Wife for financial assistance, most notably in respect of payment of the car insurance and related expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband had also left the matrimonial home since October 2019 and the parties had not had any meaningful relationship as husband and wife since that date. Quite to the contrary, it was abundantly apparent that the Wife lived in constant fear and trepidation of his harassing and controlling behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I also did not accord any credence to the Husband’s bare denials regarding the multiple incidents raised by the Wife in her pleadings. His refusal to subject himself to oral cross-examination or to provide answers to her written questions casts serious doubt on his credibility and motivation in contesting these proceedings. His intent is clearly not to preserve the marriage, but to inflict maximal pain and punishment against the Wife for her temerity to seek a divorce against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Given the compelling and overwhelming evidence, I had no doubt that the marriage had irretrievably broken down on account of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. It was also evident that there was no possibility of reconciliation given the failed interventions by mutual friends and the pattern of hostility exhibited by the Husband over the years. I therefore granted interim judgment in the Wife’s favour. As she did not request for costs, I directed that there be no order as to costs in these contested divorce proceedings.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property is considered to have been “acquired” before marriage if it was purchased and partially paid for before marriage while the balance of the purchase price was paid for during marriage via the property’s rental income – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property which had been occupied for a total of about 16 months (in two periods) during an 8½ year marriage is considered to have been “ordinarily used ... by both parties ... while the parties are residing together for shelter” – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Care and control – Child – Whether there should be an order of shared care and control on the facts","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Child placed under shared care and control of his parents – Applicable considerations","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Applicable considerations – Difference with maintenance for wife – Sections 69(1) and 114(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Appropriate multiplier and multiplicand to compute maintenance for former wife in an 8½ year marriage who is gainfully employed and has one child"],"date":"2025-06-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1469 of 2023 (Ancillary Matters)","title":"XCR v XCS","citation":"[2025] SGFC 64","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33368-SSP.xml","counsel":["Eugene Chan Qi Ming (M/s Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Husband","Malcus Poh June Zhe (M/s Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-06-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XCR v XCS</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCR <em>v</em> XCS </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33368-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 64</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

It was purchased in 2011, i.e., about four years <em>before</em> the marriage (2015). The Husband had paid the bulk of its purchase price <em>before</em> the marriage. The balance of the purchase price was paid <em>during</em> marriage via (a) funds from his parents (between 2016 to 2017) and (b) rental income from the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the Wife did not make any payment towards the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the Beijing property is a “matrimonial asset” and she should thus be given a share of it.

They continued to reside there after the marriage, until the Plaintiff’s relocation to Singapore in May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Beijing property was jointly renovated and prepared specifically for marriage, with the Wife personally overseeing the renovation, choosing furniture, fittings and interior design, with clear evidence of intent to use the property as the first matrimonial home have been provided by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Even after the parties moved to Singapore, the Wife continued to reside there for a period with her mother, and the parties returned to live in the Beijing home from May 2017 to August 2018 during the Husband’s employment in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties also hosted both sides of the extended family in the Beijing home for festive celebrations, including Chinese New Year and birthdays — affirming its role as the central family dwelling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Even after relocating to Singapore, the parties resumed residence at the Beijing property when the Husband worked in China between May 2017 and August 2018. It is significant that they did not lease out the property prior to this period, a telling fact that shows the property was held back for personal use rather than treated as an income generating investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The family’s use of the property was consistent and deeply embedded. The couple celebrated multiple Chinese New Years, birthdays, and reunions in this home with both sides of their family. It was a site of joyful family gatherings and shared tradition, further cementing its emotional and symbolic status as the nucleus of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The parties deliberately left the property vacant for the bulk of the marriage rather than leasing it out — a significant financial sacrifice that underscores the symbolic and practical role of the Beijing home as a family sanctuary, not an investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_h\"></a>(h)     It is further not disputed that the parties have resided in the matrimonial home during the significant months leading to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband submitted that the Beijing property is not a matrimonial asset.

Such works were carried out by the Husband with the assistance of a home designer and a foreman. As the parties were dating at the material time, the Wife would occasionally visit the renovation site and he would seek her inputs on the renovations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband had allowed the Wife and her mother to stay in the Beijing property shortly after the marriage. This was because he did not want them to incur rental expenses for their short stay in Beijing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Contrary to the Wife’s evidence, the parties did not have the 2015 Chinese New Year reunion dinner at the Beijing property. This dinner took place before the marriage and was held at the property for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     When the Husband was working in China, the Wife had lived with him at the Beijing property for only about <em>nine months</em> – in June 2017 and from January to August 2018. Contrary to her evidence, she did not stay there in May and July to December 2017 as she was studying at NTU at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Apart from the periods stated in (d) above, the Beijing property was either rented out by the Husband or used to house him, his relatives and/or his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband was the sole party who dealt with the Beijing property. He did not need to account to the Wife for such dealings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Wife did not make any mention about the Beijing property in her first ancillary matters affidavit. This showed that she did not regard the property as their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife’s case that the Beijing property is matrimonial asset is based on s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Charter. Accordingly, the issues are as follows. Was the Beijing property “acquired” by the Husband before the marriage? If the answer is yes, then was the property “ordinarily used by both parties ... while [they were] residing together for shelter”. If the answer to also yes, then the Beijing property is a matrimonial asset. I will now address these issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Beijing property acquired before the marriage</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the outset, I note that the parties took the position that the Beijing property had been acquired before their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I have difficulties accepting this position. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to s 112(10)(b) of the Charter, matrimonial assets include “any other asset of any nature <em>acquired during the marriage</em> by one party or both parties to the marriage”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring <em>not merely to the point of purchase</em> of an asset, but to the entire course of its acquisition. See, for instance, <em>BHN v BHO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0091.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 91</a> (“<b><em>BHN</em></b>”) at [36] where the court accepted the following observations in <em>Chee Kok Choon v Sern Kuang Eng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/48907-M.xml')\">[2005] 4 MLJ 461</a> (“<b><em>Chee Kok Choon</em></b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">9    ... The word ‘acquired’ is not the same as ‘purchased’ as ordinarily understood. In a family law setting, especially in terms of division of matrimonial assets, a down-payment may have been paid, and one party may continue mortgage instalments for the next 15 or 20 years. <em>In such a case, the ‘acquisition’ continues until the asset is fully acquired.</em> ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Courts have applied the above interpretation of “acquired” to cases where the property was purchased by the owning spouse <em>before</em> marriage and the mortgage instalments were paid using the owning spouse’s <em>CPF funds during</em> marriage. Here are some examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>BHN</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">39    ... <b>even if</b> Lagoon View was <b>purchased before</b> the marriage, the plaintiff continued to service the housing loan through her CPF contributions <em>during</em> the marriage, until 1998 when the property became fully paid up. If the plaintiff had not been paying for the housing loan, any CPF contributions earned by her during the marriage <b>would have remained in her CPF account and would have to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets</b> for the purpose of the determination of ancillary matters. As such, at least a portion of Lagoon View should be viewed as having been “acquired during the marriage” and a matrimonial asset. Simply put, the fact that the defendant made no financial contribution to Lagoon View is irrelevant as matrimonial assets rightly include assets acquired by <em>either</em> spouse’s personal efforts during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>BGT v BGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 50</a> (“<b><em>BGT</em></b>”) –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">29    ... it is well established that any contributions to [the husband’s] account from moneys earned <em>after</em> the marriage would form part of the matrimonial assets. If the husband had not been paying for the Tanamera property, his monthly contributions during the marriage would have remained in his CPF account and there would have been no doubt at the end of the marriage that those contributions would have to be included as part of the matrimonial assets. ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In our case, the Husband did not, during marriage, use his CPF funds to pay the mortgage loan for the Beijing property. Instead, the loan was paid with (i) funds from his parents and (ii) <em>rental income</em> from the property. Does the source of funds used to pay the mortgage loan affect the identity of the person “acquiring” the property?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>THL v THM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18154-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 11</a> (“<b><em>THL</em></b>”), the court answered the above question in the negative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">41    ... The question which next arises is whether, on the Father’s argument, the London Properties should nevertheless be taken <em>out</em> of the scope of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>) because, as he says, <b>the funds used for repaying the mortgage loans come primarily from the rental income generated on those properties</b> and, to a lesser extent, his pre-matrimonial income. In other words, <em>BHN</em> only applied where the acquisition is serviced by “active earnings”; in <em>BHN</em> the acquisition was paid with salary earned. The unarticulated premise of this argument is that notwithstanding that an asset appears to have been acquired during the course of a particular marriage, the court should go on to scrutinise the <em>source of funds</em> for the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">42    In my judgment, this does not accord with the wording of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>), which <b>simply directs the court’s inquiry to the </b><b><em>timing of the acquisition</em></b> <b>of the property concerned</b>. ... Whether he funds a specific investment within this portfolio out of his salary or a pre-existing pool of money is arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f\"></a>(f)     To sum-up –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring not merely to the point of purchase of a property, but to the entire course of its acquisition. A property is “acquired” only when it has been fully paid for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       If the owning spouse continues to pay for the property during marriage for the purpose of acquiring it, then it is a matrimonial asset pursuant to s 112(10)(b). This is so regardless of the source of the spouse’s payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g\"></a>(g)     This leads to the next issue. Should the above interpretation of “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) similarly apply to the same word in s 112(10)(a)(i)? In my view, the answer should be yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, it is settled law that a piece of statute should be construed as a whole and purposively. It is well accepted that “the Parliamentary draftsman would not indulge in elegant variation, but would keep to a particular term when wishing to convey a particular meaning”. In line with this, a word or a phrase has the same meaning throughout the statute unless the contrary intention is shown. See e.g., <em>Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0360.xml')\">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 360</a> at [101]; <em>Fernandez Joseph Ferdinent v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0065.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 65</a> at [24]; <em>Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 461</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/13184-SSP-M.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 777</a> at [19]. In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that Parliament had intended the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i) and s 112(10)(b) is to have different meanings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, to interpret the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) and s 112(10)(a)(i) differently will mean that the <em>same</em> property in the scenarios in [11(c)] and [11(e)] above is simultaneously (1) a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(b)) and (2) not a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(a)(i)). This is absurd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I am mindful that there is <em>dictum</em> in <em>USB v USA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“<b><em>USB</em></b>”) that <em>may suggest</em> that a property can be treated as having been “acquired” even though it has not been fully paid for. For ease of reference, I reproduced substantively [19] of <em>USB</em>. Note in particular [19(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19    ... Section 112 of the Charter contemplates that assets in at least three categories may be subject to the court’s powers of division. The classes of assets that the parties may possess are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    “Quintessential matrimonial assets” ...: these are assets which either spouse derived from income earned during the marriage or to which either spouse or both spouses obtained legal title during the marriage by applying their own money, and the matrimonial home, whenever and however acquired. The <em>entire value</em> of these assets assessed as at the ancillary matters date (generally) will go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but ... which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the <em>whole asset</em> goes into the pool but <em>if there is no transformation then, subject to (c)</em> below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with <em>general principles of property law.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    “Pre-marriage assets”: these are assets that either spouse <b><em>acquired </em></b><em>before</em> the marriage and ... which are not used for family purposes. These stay out of the pool unless ... they are <b><em>partially paid for </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage by the owning spouse with income that would have been a quintessential matrimonial asset had it been saved up rather than expended on the pre-marriage asset. Then, the proportion of the value of the asset that was<b><em> acquired </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage should go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, <em>USB</em> do not preclude the view taken in [11(g)] above. <em>First</em>, the court there did not seek to lay down a definition for the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i). <em>Second</em>, there is nothing in its judgement to show that the court had been alerted to the caselaw and considerations in [11] above on the interpretation of the word “acquired”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Thus, in line with well settled caselaw, since the purchase price of the Beijing property was paid by the Husband (via funds from his parents and the property’s rental income) <em>during</em> the marriage, the property is a “matrimonial asset” pursuant to <em>s 112(10)(b)</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the parties “ordinarily use” the Beijing property together for shelter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given the above, there is no need for me to further determine whether the Beijing property qualifies as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, since the parties had made substantial submissions on this issue, I will make some observations regarding this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I begin by setting out the applicable principles. To qualify as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i), a property must satisfy three requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “<u>Residing together</u>”. <em>First</em>, both parties must have resided “together” at the property. Section 112(10)(a)(i) is not met if only one of them had resided there: <em>UZK v UZL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24585-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 1248</a> at [35]; <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> at [66].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “<u>For shelter</u>”. <em>Second</em>, the property must have been used “for shelter”. Unlike s 112(10)(a)(ii) (which provides for the transformation of solely owned assets into matrimonial assets by way of “substantial improvement”), it is <em>not</em> necessary under s 112(10)(a)(i) for the property to have been used for shelter “during the marriage”. In other words, a property may be transformed into a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) even if the parties’ residence at the property had occurred <em>before</em> their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “<u>Ordinarily used</u>”. <em>Finally</em>, the parties’ residence at the property must be of “sufficient regularity and frequency”: <em>USB</em> at [24]; <em>CLB v CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27504-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 1 SLR 658</a> at [26]; <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a> at [18]; <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> (“<b><em>BJS</em></b>”) at [23] and [24]. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The requirement of ordinary usage is intended to prevent the non-owning spouse from enjoying an “unmerited windfall”. Put in another way, the purpose of this requirement is to prevent a party from acquiring a pre-marriage property by simply staying there “casually” or “occasionally” without contributing to the “marital partnership”: <em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0405.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 405</a> at [43]; <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32591-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 2 SLR 557</a> at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In line with this, courts have held that a property is not a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) in the following cases: (1) it was occupied only occasionally during a two-year marriage (<em>BJS</em> at [23] and [24]), (2) it was a holiday home that was occupied for only 21 days in a 14-year marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [59] and [60]), and (3) it was occupied on only two occasions during a 10-year marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> [2016] 3 SLR(R) 717 at [15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       At this juncture, it bears noting that while the length of stay at the property is relevant in determining whether it is a matrimonial asset – this is not a decisive factor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> What is more important is whether the property had been used as a <em>matrimonial home</em> – or, to put it more elegantly, as the “cradle of the family”: <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0605.xml')\">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 605</a> at [33]. If the answer is yes, then the property is a matrimonial asset. For examples, see, e.g., (1) <em>CXR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a> (“<b><em>CXR</em></b>”) (property was used as a matrimonial home for 21 months during a nine-year marriage), (2) <em>VGR v VGS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24217-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 27</a> (“<b><em>VGR</em></b>”) at [140] (property was used as a matrimonial home during the first one to two years of a 10-year marriage), (3) <em>TND v TNC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20287-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 34</a> at [36] (property was used as a matrimonial home for 15 months during a 13-year marriage), and (4) <em>XGW v XGX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32690-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 2</a> at [1], [2] and [21] (property was used as a matrimonial home for about two years during a five-year marriage).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Applying the above principles to the present facts, I find that the Beijing property is a “matrimonial asset” under s 112(10)(a)(i). Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties’ residence at the Beijing property is neither “casual” or “occasional”.

They began co-habiting in the Beijing property in October 2014 and continued to reside there together after their marriage in February 2015. (As stated in [17(b)], the period of their residence in the property <em>before</em> marriage can be considered under s 112(10)(a)(i).) The parties eventually left the property in May 2015 when the Husband began working in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <u>Second period (Nine months)</u>. The Husband subsequently found work in Beijing. When he returned there in May 2017, he resided at the Beijing property. The Wife stayed with him at the property in June 2017 and from January to August 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Beijing property had served as the parties’ matrimonial home at the start of the marriage. They would probably have continued to live there but for the fact that the Husband had found a job in Singapore in 2015. When the Husband returned to Beijing to work, the property once again served as the parties’ matrimonial home. The property would have continued to serve as their matrimonial home if not for the Husband’s decision to work in Singapore in 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Value of the Beijing property</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Having determined that the Beijing property is a matrimonial asset, the next step is to assess its value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The parties’ submission on this are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.92%\"><col width=\"50.08%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">RMB2.1M<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">RMB2,429,800<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I prefer to adopt the Husband’s valuation. <em>First</em>, it is based on an <em>actual offer</em> made for the Beijing property (in November 2024). <em>Second</em>, his valuation is <em>more recent</em> than the Wife’s, which is based on an appraisal report done 2½ years ago (in January 2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In valuing the Beijing property, I agree with the Wife that it is appropriate to deduct its outstanding mortgage loan.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I assess this loan to be RMB393,381.27.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> After deducting the outstanding mortgage loan from RMB2.1M, the value of the Beijing property is RMB1,706,618.73 (<b>$318,994.16</b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Disputed asset – Husband’s $500,000 bonus in 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now turn to the next disputed asset – the Husband’s bonus of about $500,000 in 2021 (“<b>Bonus</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife contended that the Husband had failed to account for the Bonus.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This contention had been “vehemently denied”.

It is also the Husband’s evidence that he had, among others, (i) coordinated the son’s weekly sessions with a speech therapist from September 2021 to February 2023, (ii) got the child ready in the morning and sent him to the childcare centre, (iii) picked up the son from the half-day childcare, (iv) enrolled him in full-day preschool, and (v) brought the child to the early intervention centre for four days a week since March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The foregoing evidence shows that the Husband is a hands-on father.

In my view, the Wife can co-parent. I note the following evidence from her:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Although my marriage with the [Husband] is coming to an end, my only wish is to create a nurturing and secure environment for [the son] to grow up in.

I accept the Husband’s submissions that the claims were raised only in the Wife’s last affidavit in February 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> and that he did not have the opportunity to respond to any of them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Given that the Husband had sought a shared care and control arrangement as far back as in his first affidavit (March 2024), the Wife could (and should) have raised her claims earlier as to why the Husband cannot be trusted to co-parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) For completeness, I wish to add that the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests. The <em>Husband is to note</em> that should he fail to involve the Wife in matters relating to the son, then this can affect, e.g., a court’s assessment as to whether such an order should be varied to a sole care and control order in favour of the Wife.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(e) <em>Finally</em>, I note the parties have been attending counselling to assist them in co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> This can help to reduce the acrimony between them.

These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Courts must “have regard to all the circumstances of the case” when ordering child maintenance in divorce cases: s 69(4) read with s 127 of the Charter. This includes considering whether there is a significant disparity in the financial positions between the parties, and if so, whether one of them will suffer hardship if he/she is made to contribute equally to the child’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_60-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If there is <em>no</em> such disparity, then courts have ordered the parties (i) to bear the child’s expenses equally, and (ii) to bear the costs for the child’s living expenses when he/she is in the party’s respective care. See e.g., <em>CXR</em> at [2], [117] and [119]; <em>VFS v VFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24144-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 15</a> at [36]; <em>VLE v VLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24918-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 74</a> at [54] to [56].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_60-p2_b\"></a>(b)     However, if there <em>is</em> a significant disparity and one of them will suffer hardship, then courts have the power to – and should – mitigate such hardship.

s 114(2)(f) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)       The Wife had suffered economic prejudice as a result of her sacrifices for the family. To support the Husband’s career, she had given up her own career in China to follow him to Singapore. The Husband accepted that despite having a master’s degree from China, the Wife had found it difficult to get a job here based on her qualifications. The situation became so untenable that she had to undertake a course lasting for a few months to improve her job prospects in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Further, the Wife had to relocate from Singapore to China, and then back to Singapore again, so that the Husband could seek better career opportunities. During the marriage, the Wife had also stopped work for about 18 months to care for the son. Such a lengthy period of unemployment would surely have an impact on her career. To be clear, in deciding to order spousal maintenance for the Wife, I am mindful that such maintenance is not intended to compensate her for loss of employment or for income that she might have had the opportunity to earn: <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [43] and [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplicand</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Having determined that it is appropriate to order spousal maintenance, the next issue is <em>how much</em> should be the amount in the present case. On this issue, s 114(2) of the Charter directs that if a court decides to order maintenance under s 113(1), then –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... the court is to endeavour to <em>place the parties</em>, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, <em>in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down</em> and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation: <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [31]. In my view, one way of achieving the objective in s 114(2) is to consider (a) what additional expenses a former wife would have to bear on her own, and (b) what income she would lose, as a direct result of the divorce. After considering these matters, a court will be in a better position to determine the amount of financial relief needed to help a former wife weather the transitions brought about by the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     It bears highlighting that when determining the quantum of the maintenance to order, a court is not required to ensure that a former wife is put in the same financial position as she was pre-divorce. Instead, a court is simply required to “endeavour” to minimise the financial disruption to her in “so far as it is practicable”. In this regard, s 114(1) stipulates that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>114.</b>—(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>a</em>) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>b</em>) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>c</em>) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>d</em>) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>e</em>) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>f</em>) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>g</em>) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Applying these principles to the present case, I make the following findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The maintenance sought by the Wife is unreasonable. <em>First</em>, she had failed to prove that if the marriage had not broken down, the Husband would have ordinarily paid for her expenses at $7,580/month. <em>Second</em>, I find that a number of the expenses that she had claimed for – e.g., transport (at $1,000/month), clothing (at $200/month), accessories (at $300/month), and holiday (at $1,000/month) – is excessive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span><em>Finally</em>, I fail to understand why she is unable to pay for her personal expenses given that her income is $3,009/month: s 114(1)(a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the divorce, the Wife will have to incur rental expenses: s 114(1)(b). She would not need to bear such expenses “if the marriage had not broken down”. Accordingly, I find it appropriate for the Husband to pay the Wife <b>$2,500/month</b> as financial relief to help cover her likely monthly deficits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplier</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The next question is for <em>how long</em> the maintenance should last.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Husband had submitted that the maintenance be limited to only six months. I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The period of maintenance proposed by the Husband is sufficient to cover the Wife’s rental expenses for only half a year. Her income is unlikely to increase by $2,500 in that time. After this period, is she supposed to dip into her share of the matrimonial assets to cover the deficits?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, a short multiplier (such as six months) is generally ordered where there is a need to tide a former wife over for a short period to meet her immediate financial needs. One example is <em>UYD</em>. In that case, the High Court had ordered the man to pay his former wife six months’ maintenance to tide her over until he transferred $384,006.27 (of matrimonial funds) to her. Pursuant to the divorce, she had received four properties worth more than $15M. One of them was for her residence, and she could receive rental income from the other three properties as a substitute for maintenance: <em>UYD</em> at [65] to [67].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In my view, the period of maintenance should give the Wife sufficient time to adapt to her new circumstances post-divorce and to stabilise her finances. In this regard, applying s 114(1), I note the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife has a take-home income of about $3,009/month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, she has the capacity to earn more income because she (i) is relatively young (about 38 years old),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> and (ii) has a master’s degree in sports science and a Master of Arts’ degree in teaching Chinese as an international language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the marriage is about 8½ years. The duration of the marriage is important to ensure that the period of maintenance is not excessive. See e.g., <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [55] where the High Court rejected a prayer for a multiplier of three years of maintenance as being excessive when the marriage had lasted for only three years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Considering the factors wholistically, I find that a multiplier of <b>four years</b> of maintenance is reasonable. Such a multiplier is consistent with the following precedents:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col

On 2 December 2024, they had set ablaze the door of an apartment and had scrawled “O$P$” in indelible ink on an adjacent wall. They had done so in response to a job offer on a social media platform that promised payment of $2,000 upon the completion of these tasks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 5 February 2024, the youth pleaded guilty to the offence in the Youth Court, which called for a probation suitability report to assist its formulation of dispositional orders for the youth. While that report was prepared, the court extended the bail that had been granted to the youth on conditions that included a curfew from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am and a requirement to attend school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 30 April 2025, a probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development submitted the probation suitability report. Therein, she assessed the youth to have a “High” risk of re-offending. He led an “unbridled and unstructured lifestyle” marked by “chronic school absenteeism since 2017”, associated with negative peers, and minimised the effects of his actions. His family provided “inadequate supervision, permissive and neglectful parenting” that left unaddressed his behavioural issues. Given these factors, the probation officer concluded that the youth was unsuitable for community-based rehabilitation such as probation and instead recommended a 21-month placement at the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (the “JRC”) of the Singapore Boys’ Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The prosecution endorsed these recommendations and submitted that a 21-month placement in the JRC was in the best interests of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The youth and his parents asked he be placed on probation. The youth desired to reside with his family and promised to submit to electronic monitoring and the supervision of his parents to secure his compliance with a probation order. The parents of the youth aligned themselves with this position and were confident that the youth could comply with a probation order because they had “observed positive changes in him since the offence”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Everyone thus accepted that rehabilitation was to be the predominant consideration and was in the best interests of the youth, whose welfare was paramount concern in these proceedings pursuant to s 4(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”). I agreed. The offence, although serious, was not grave. The harm caused was limited to a charred door. The youth was just 14 years of age. Focusing on his rehabilitation was justified given the characteristically impulsive nature of his adolescent decision-making. Further, society was keen on his reform given the years that he had ahead of him (see <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [37]). What remained was for me to decide whether that rehabilitation would be realised better by placing him on probation or in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As VK Rajah JA observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')\">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“<em>Al-Ansari</em>”) at [55], a probation order is a community-based dispositional order. Even as it seeks to “protect society through the supervision to which the offender is required to submit, it both minimises the restrictions placed upon him and offers him the help of society in adjusting his conduct to its demands.” It aims to “strengthen the offender’s resources so that he may become a more responsible member of the community, which must also play a part in rehabilitating him.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As the Youth Court observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v XML (a minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33193-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGYC 1</a> (“<em>XML</em>”) at [8], two conditions must exist for a probation order to be viable. First, the characteristics of the offender must render him amenable to community-based rehabilitation. He must accept responsibility for his actions, desire to change for the better, and possess the self-discipline to bring that desire to fruition. Second, the offender must have adequate family support because probationary supervision takes place substantially in the natural setting of the offender and not in a closed institution. The probation officer is “never going to be able to supervise the offender closely on a day-to-day basis” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> at [24]). It is thus incumbent on the family of the offender to ensure that he remains on the straight and narrow. In the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> (“<em>WLK</em>”) at [12], “a disciplined home is essential”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Given the characteristics of the youth and his home environment, I agreed with the prosecution and the probation officer that the structured environment of the JRC would best realise the rehabilitation of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     First, the youth tended to disregard rules while in the community. His school records from 2017 to 2024 revealed unjustified absences for between 38% and 91% of each academic year. In the limited time that he spent in school, he was disruptive during lessons, had altercations with his peers, used profanities, and was frequently late. Outside school, he had in 2024 paid a composition fine of $300 for using an e-vaporiser in breach of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed). Subsequently, he perpetrated the acts of mischief by fire that were the subject of these proceedings and was arrested by the police. But these events did not deter him. In February 2025, he was found to be in unlawful possession of an article resembling a tobacco product and paid another composition fine of $300 for it. This recidivism demonstrated a resistance to authority that would compromise community-based probationary supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Second, even as the youth professed remorse, he showed limited commitment to reform. He expressed unwillingness towards working with social service professionals on his rehabilitation but promised to do so “if it meant he would be able to be placed on probation”. He claimed that he would abide by the terms of a probation order but offered few substantive details on how he would do so. Indeed, compliance with even the conditions that secured his release on bail (see [2] above) proved beyond him. In April 2025 alone, he was absent at least 16 of the 21 school days that month and was late on four of the remaining school days. And he fared little better on the curfew despite the reminders of the probation officer. I excerpt the observations of the probation officer, which observations were not challenged by the youth or by his parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Irregular compliance to trial time restriction (TR) of 9pm to 6am imposed by PO [<em>ie</em>, the probation officer] since 7 Feb 2025. Was present at home during video call checks on 22 Feb, 8 Mar 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    It was noted that [the youth] was behind time in sending his live location on various occasions. Attributed his lapses to forgetfulness and being preoccupied with other tasks like showering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Returned home at 9.57pm on 15 Mar 2025 after visiting his maternal grandmother in the hospital. Both [the youth] and parents did not seek prior approval from PO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Was not present at home during a video call check on 25 Apr 2025. [the youth] explained to PO that he had misplaced his phone and transportation card during his commute home from school. Returned home at 11.19pm. However, according to [the youth’s school], [the youth] was absent from school without a valid reason that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Returned home at 9.38pm on 27 Apr 2025. Father only informed PO at 8.55pm that [the youth] was out visiting and caring for his sickly great grandmother at her house. [the youth] did not seek prior approval from PO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    In addition, paid no heed to PO’s instructions to regularly attend school during the period of social investigations. It was noted that it was a school-going day during a scheduled interview with PO on 1 Apr 2025, but [the youth] did not attend school. Reasoned that he had overslept that day and found it pointless to attend school as he would be eventually sent home due to latecoming anyway.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Attributed his failure in attending school to persistent ill health (that were not covered by valid MCs) and him oversleeping.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Third, the inability of the youth to work with the probation officer as she prepared the probation suitability report showed his unfitness for community-based rehabilitation. He missed interviews that she had scheduled with him to assess his suitability for probation. He evaded her questions on his school attendance and general conduct. And he disregarded her instructions to obtain medical certificates and to undergo a medical examination to determine if his health had affected his conduct. I reproduce the observations of the probation officer, which observations were not disputed by the youth or by his parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Defaulted a scheduled interview with PO [<em>ie</em>, the probation officer] on 14 Mar 2025 as he claimed that he was unwell. However, despite PO’s instructions to obtain a valid medical certificate (MC), he did not do so. No reason was provided for his failure to provide a valid MC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Defaulted another scheduled interview with PO on 20 Mar 2025, citing persistent ill health from the week before. PO had instructed parents to accompany [the youth] to obtain a valid MC, but they did not do so until 21 Mar 2025. Father claimed that [the youth] was so ill to the point that he could not leave the house to visit the doctor, and parents were unable to assist him out of bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    PO had also directed [the youth] to undergo a comprehensive medical checkup on 1 and 9 Apr 2025 to rule out underlying health concerns. However, there were no further updates provided to PO by [the youth] and parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On their part, the parents of the youth struggled to supervise him. First, they were “uncooperative” with the probation officer. They were “unforthcoming about their history with social service professionals” and “presented to have difficulties recollecting past events, including [the youth’s] attendance and conduct in school.” Second, they failed to enforce the curfew and the attendance of the youth in school despite the reminders of the probation officer, even as this failure was a breach of the conditions of the bail that the mother of the youth had furnished to secure his release in these proceedings. Third, their proposals on supervising the youth on a probation order lacked substance and were limited to “trusting him, checking his bags whenever he returned home, and locking the house gate by a stipulated time to ensure that he would return home before his curfew hours”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under a probation order, an offender is “conditionally entrusted with freedom so that he may learn the social duties it involves” (see <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [55]). But the youth lacked the discipline of his self and of his home environment to be entrusted with such freedom. The option that would best secure his rehabilitation was the closed and structured environment of the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     For completeness, the two accomplices of the youth were dealt with respectively in YC-900005-2025 and YC-900006-2025. The former accomplice was motivated to change his ways, was responsive to authority, and had strong family and community support that conduced to his rehabilitation. He was thus placed on a probation order for 18 months. The latter accomplice, by contrast, showed limited commitment to reform, was poorly supervised by his family and his community, and needed a structured environment for his rehabilitation. He was thus placed in the JRC for 21 months, with the Youth Court recording its grounds for this decision in <em>XML</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Parity in sentencing between co-offenders in a joint enterprise serves the penal objectives of retribution (ensuring just deserts) and deterrence (discouraging future offending). But these objectives held reduced significance in these proceedings. Here, the “first and paramount consideration”, as in all proceedings under the CYPA, was the “welfare and best interests” of the child or young person before the court (see <em>WLK</em> at [10] citing s 4(b) of the CYPA). My concern was thus less on ensuring utilitarian sentencing symmetry between the youth and his accomplices, and more on crafting dispositional orders that best rehabilitated the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having found that the institutional environment of the JRC would best rehabilitate the youth, I turned to consider the length of the time that he should spend there. In <em>XML</em>, the Youth Court had observed that the welfare of the latter accomplice was served by a 21-month stint that involved three sequential stages: 3 months to introduce discipline and structure in his lifestyle; 12 months to build his capacity for change and strengthen his support networks; and 6 months to re-integrate him into the community (at [4]). In my judgment, the characteristics of the youth and of his home environment were not unlike those of the latter accomplice. His best interests would be promoted by a similar stint in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I thus ordered the youth to reside in the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for a period of 21 months, with effect from 14 May 2025. The youth is dissatisfied with this decision and has filed an appeal against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I record my appreciation to Mr Philip Leong and Mr Jasper Yap, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court for these proceedings pursuant to s 38 of the CYPA, for their service and their advice in these proceedings.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2025-06-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 2058 of 2023","title":"XNQ v XNR","citation":"[2025] SGFC 65","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33354-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Connie Kuan and Mr Tan Jin Song (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Mr Daniel Atticus Xu (Exodus Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-06-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Phang Hsiao Chung","html":"<root><head><title>XNQ v XNR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XNQ <em>v</em> XNR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33354-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 65</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

These were affidavits filed in relation to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories in FC/SUM 1770/2024 and FC/SUM 1771/2024, respectively. On 13 September 2024, an Assistant Registrar ordered the Husband to make certain clarifications, on affidavit, in relation to 2 withdrawals (of $5,000 and $25,000 made on 1 and 3 June 2023, respectively) from the Husband’s bank account, and to provide documents in support of these transactions or, if the Husband was unable to do so, to provide an explanation on affidavit and disclose any documents in support of the explanation.

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under the Interim Judgment, the following ancillary matters were adjourned to be heard in Chambers:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     division of matrimonial assets (including the Matrimonial Home);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s claim for maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     costs of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As regards the division of matrimonial assets, the parties agreed that the structured approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> should apply. The parties also agreed that the parties’ direct financial contributions ratio should be 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour. However, there was no agreement on the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions. The Wife argues that the indirect contributions ratio should be 70 : 30 in the Wife’s favour. The Husband asks the Court to consider a 50 : 50 ratio for the parties’ indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife also submitted that there should be a further uplift of at least 3% of the average ratio in her favour. After the Wife commenced the divorce on 5 May 2023, the Husband withdrew a sum of $5,000 on 1 June 2023, and a further sum of $25,000 on 3 June 2023, from his OCBC bank account. The Husband claimed, in DA4, that the withdrawals were made “completely for [the parties’] son”, to “help [the parties’] son defray his expenses towards his tuition fees and the initial payment of his BTO (Built to order) flat”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband also exhibited certain documents in DA4 in support of this claim. The Wife submitted that those documents did not show that the combined sum of $30,000 was transferred to the parties’ son or used as payment for the son’s tuition fees or HDB flat, and that therefore an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband, and there should be an uplift in the Wife’s favour of at least 3% of the average ratio of the Wife’s direct and indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As regards the Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife sought maintenance of $800 per month for 3 years. The Husband submitted that there should be no maintenance for the Wife. However, the Husband listed in DA1 and DA2, among his direct financial contributions towards the Matrimonial Home, a monthly payment of $300 described as “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterated, at paragraph 26 of DA1, that he was “currently repaying” a “Loan of S$20,000.00 taken up by the Plaintiff”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of the matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I deal first with the division of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife explained in considerable detail at paragraph 15 of PA1 why she was the main caregiver of the son, and why she should be regarded as having made the larger proportion of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the matrimonial assets. The matters set out in paragraph 15 of PA1 that are relevant to the Wife’s indirect financial and non-financial contributions include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 1989, the Wife set up a printing business called APG using her savings. In order to take over the premises to be occupied by APG, the Wife paid the landlord around $20,000 of outstanding rent owed by the previous tenant. The Wife purchased machinery and equipment, including 4 cameras that cost more than $30,000 each. The Wife also paid for renovations costing around $15,000. The Wife estimated that she spent over $100,000 to set up APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties registered their marriage on 3 March 1992. The Wife paid for the parties’ first matrimonial property on her own, using her CPF moneys and cash. The Wife also paid for the renovations to, and furniture for, the matrimonial property. The Wife made all of those payments, as the Husband was then unemployed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband was assisting the Wife with the running of APG by the time the Wife became pregnant in 1995. However, the Wife still had to go to work during her pregnancy, because the Husband was not familiar with the running of APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties’ son was delivered by caesarean section, had jaundice after he was born, and had to be hospitalised for over 10 days. The Wife also had to return to the hospital after she was discharged, when the “wound split”. The Wife paid for the hospitalisation fees of over $20,000 using cash and her CPF moneys.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Wife continued to cook and do household chores after giving birth to the parties’ son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     After the parties’ son was discharged from the hospital, the Wife brought the son out for “suntan” every morning. The Wife also brought the son for check-ups at the polyclinic for 18 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_g\"></a>(g)     As the Husband was unfamiliar with aspects of APG’s business, the Wife would return to the office with the parties’ son to finish the work. While running APG’s business, the Wife topped up $30,000 into the Husband’s “Medishield account” (sic) for him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_h\"></a>(h)     In 1997, the Husband refused to let the Wife go back to running APG full-time, even though the Wife wanted to do so. The Wife therefore found a job, and engaged a domestic helper to look after the parties’ son while the Wife was at work. The Wife paid for the domestic helper’s salary and related expenses on her own, without help from the Husband. The Wife also took care of the parties’ son, and cooked dinner, after returning home from work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In 1998, whenever the parties’ son fell sick while attending daycare, the Wife attended to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_j\"></a>(j)     In 1999, when the son was in kindergarten, the Wife would send the son to school and pick up the son from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_k\"></a>(k)     The Husband left everything concerning the education of the parties’ son to the Wife. The Wife visited several schools before enrolling the son in a kindergarten that the Wife thought would provide a better environment for the son. The Wife also enrolled the son in an English course that cost around $1,600, which the Wife paid for using her salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_l\"></a>(l)     When the parties’ son started primary school in 2003, the Wife would wake him up, get him ready for school, and wait with him for the school bus. The Wife also took leave to accompany the son on the first 3 days of school. When the son attended primary school in the afternoon, the Wife would go to work later, and pick up the son after work. The Wife cooked the family’s meals when she did not have to work on Sundays. The Wife helped the son with his homework until he was in Primary 4, when she could no longer help him. The Wife attended all the meet-the-parents sessions of the son’s school on her own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_m\"></a>(m)     Until 2007, the Wife continued to go back to APG after work to complete tasks that the Husband did not know how to do. When the parties’ son was young, the Wife would bring him along, and watch over him while she finished tasks. Throughout the years from 1989 to 2007, the Wife would liaise with APG’s clients, take orders, give quotations, and meet with APG’s clients after work, on Saturdays or while she was on leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_n\"></a>(n)     The Wife paid for the family’s expenses without help from the Defendant, including car-related expenses for 5 cars purchased over 12 years and registered in the Husband’s name. The car-related expenses included monthly instalments, road tax, petrol, car park charges, insurance, ERP (or “Electronic Road Pricing”) charges and fines. The Wife paid for the expenses using her salary and the moneys in APG’s bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_o\"></a>(o)     The Wife gave the parties’ son pocket money (on top of what the Husband was giving) all the way until the son was in National Service. The Wife also paid for the son’s toys and other items while he was growing up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_p\"></a>(p)     When the Wife injured her spine in 2005, she had to pay for her surgery on her own. The Husband did not care for her after the surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_q\"></a>(q)     In 2007, when the Husband told the Wife that his friend wanted to join APG for $25,000, the Wife agreed and transferred the business to the Husband’s name. However, the Husband did not pay the Wife for the business, even though she followed up with him a few times; the Husband kept telling the Wife that the business was not making money and he could not pay her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_r\"></a>(r)     In 2009, when the parties’ son started attending secondary school, the Wife would send him to school. The Wife continued to send the son to school until he completed polytechnic education. She also sent him to his campsite, and sent him home when he booked out from camp, until he almost finished his National Service in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In contrast, paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA1 merely contained particulars of the Husband’s direct and indirect financial contributions. The indirect contributions particularised in paragraph 19 of DA1 comprised the son’s school expenses, pocket money, handphone charges, and expenses for weekend meals and healthcare. The bulk of those expenses were incurred after the Wife was retrenched in January 2010. The Husband repeated those particulars at paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA2. Although the Husband stated at paragraph 21 of DA2 that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities during the course of [the parties’] marriage”, the Husband provided no details of his indirect non-financial contributions. The Husband did not deny any of the Wife’s statements concerning her indirect financial and non-financial contributions. The Husband in fact acknowledged the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions when he stated in paragraph 21 of DA2 that “both parties have expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son during the course of [the parties’] marriage”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The parties’ son made certain allegations concerning his upbringing in paragraph 6 of SA1. However, I disregarded those allegations, and similar allegations made by the Husband in paragraph 6 of DA4. To begin with, none of those allegations were relevant to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, or to the Husband’s compliance with the orders made on 13 September 2024. Any allegations disputing the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions should have been contained in DA2, and should have been made within the time allowed by the Court for the filing of DA2 (i.e. by 29 February 2024). Those allegations appeared to be an attempt to introduce belatedly, without the permission of the Court, evidence that is designed to prejudice the Court against the Wife, on an occasion where the Wife had no opportunity to respond to those allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having regard to the evidence contained in PA1, PA2, DA1 and DA2, it is clear that both parties have made indirect financial contributions over the course of the marriage. Given the course of time, and the lack of documentation, it will not be possible to say with certainty whether the Husband or the Wife made more indirect financial contributions. The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s contentions that she supported him and the family financially during the marriage. It appeared that the Husband stepped up after the Wife encountered difficulties with her health, employment and undertakings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     However, the Wife appeared to have made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions than the Husband over the course of the marriage. For instance, the Wife appeared to have been the son’s main caregiver until the Wife started to drive a taxi full-time in 2011. The bulk of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions were made in the early years of the parties’ marriage, during the formative years of the parties’ son. The details of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions, which were asserted in paragraph 15 of PA1 and summarised at paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Plaintiff’s written submissions, were not denied by the Husband in DA2. The Husband made vague statements, such as that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities” and “expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son”, but provided no particulars of his indirect non-financial contributions, in DA1 and DA2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     All things considered, I assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I agreed with the Wife’s submission that the Husband had failed to properly account for the total of $30,000 withdrawn from the Husband’s OCBC Account on 1 and 3 June 2023. The Husband did not explain how the documents exhibited at pages 5 to 13 of DA4 supported his claim that the withdrawals were made completely for the parties’ son, to help the son defray the son’s expenses. The exhibited documents did not suggest that the parties’ son was required to pay any amount of his tuition fees, or to repay any amount of his tuition fee loan, on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. Nor did the documents suggest that the son was required to pay any amount to the HDB for the son’s flat on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. The writ for divorce, statement of claim and statement of particulars were received by the Husband on 13 May 2023. The withdrawals were made just a few days before the Husband filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 7 June 2023, and appeared to be timed to reduce the amount of matrimonial assets available for distribution. Even if the son ultimately benefitted from the withdrawals made on 1 and 3 June 2023, that did not change the complexion of those withdrawals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I did not think I should make an arbitrary uplift of 3% in the Wife’s favour on account of the Husband’s failure. If the Husband had properly accounted for that sum of $30,000, it would have formed part of the Husband’s direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets, and enlarged the pool of matrimonial assets available for distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The parties arrived at the direct financial contributions ratio of 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour on the basis that the Husband’s direct financial contributions amounted to $287,533.62 while the Wife’s direct financial contributions amounted to $272,785.35. If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the Husband’s direct financial contributions would increase to $317,533.62, or 53.8% of the parties’ total direct financial contributions of $590,318.97. The direct financial contribution ratio would then be 53.8 : 46.2 in the Husband’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I have assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour, after averaging the parties’ direct and indirect contributions, I would arrive at a final ratio of 53.1 : 46.9 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the matrimonial assets available for distribution would be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

However, there were other expenses listed by the Husband that appeared reasonable. For instance, the Husband claimed, when DA2 was affirmed on 11 March 2024, that he was paying the following monthly expenses (which collectively would expend most of the Husband’s monthly take home salary): (a) $837 for the housing loan for the Matrimonial Home; (b) $67.50 for service and conservancy charges; (c) $40 for water; (d) $100 for electricity; (e) $13 for property tax; (f) $100 for transportation; (g) $450 for food and beverages; and (h) $300 for “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It was not disputed that the Wife had borrowed at least $18,000 under a loan for which the Husband had acted as a guarantor, and that the Husband had made monthly repayments of $300 towards the loan, at least until 28 April 2023,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> before the Wife filed the writ for divorce.

However, the Husband declined to reciprocate when the Wife was in poor health and unable to work, primarily on the ground that he lacked the means to support her. While the amount to be paid by the Husband to the Wife for her share of the Matrimonial Home may go some way to meeting her expenses, a part of that amount would have to be refunded to her CPF accounts in accordance with the applicable CPF legislation, and another part of that amount would be required by her for alternative accommodation. I was mindful that both parties had limited financial resources. As the Husband claimed that his monthly expenses included a repayment of $300 a month towards the discharge of the loan taken by the Wife (for which the Husband was a guarantor), there would be no increase in the Husband’s monthly expenses if he was ordered to continue the monthly repayments, for a period of 2 years, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the matters listed in section 114(1)(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>), (<em>d</em>), (<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, I ordered the Defendant to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     At the hearing on 21 January 2025, the Wife’s counsel applied for the Husband to pay costs of $1,500 to $2,000, as the Court had agreed with the Wife’s submissions for indirect contributions and her claim for maintenance. The Wife’s counsel also sought costs for the original hearing of the ancillary matters on 18 December 2024, which had to be adjourned when the Husband’s counsel failed to attend the hearing. By a letter dated 18 December 2024 sent after the hearing, the Husband’s counsel apologised for his absence, and explained that due to an oversight following the departure of a paralegal, the Husband’s counsel was scheduled with 3 other matters (including a mediation at the State Courts) that clashed with the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband’s counsel left the issue of costs to the Court. He pointed out that this was a “small family matter”, and asked for the costs of the adjournment to be awarded against him (instead of his client) as the adjournment was caused by his error.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I am mindful that in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17741-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 6</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>, at [32] and [33], the Family Division of the High Court observed that there are usually good reasons in the context of matrimonial proceedings to depart from the guiding principle that costs should follow the event. Citing rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force at the time that <em>JBB v JBA</em> was decided), the Court also observed that the principle that costs should follow the event may be departed from where it is appropriate to do so. In the context of divorce proceedings, the Court gave as examples (of when this would be appropriate) cases where the judgment of divorce was obtained based on a “neutral” fact such as “living apart” or upon compromise by the parties to proceed on an uncontested basis (whatever the fact relied on), or where an order of costs would aggravate the acrimony between the parties and it was important in the circumstances to reduce the risk of increasing hostility. The Court also observed that in the context of the hearing of ancillary matters (which may be considered to be discrete from the divorce proceedings), it is the conduct of the parties in the proceedings which will have greater relevance in the exercise of the discretion in determining costs, and that a party who has been uncooperative in disclosing his or her assets and means would be unlikely to receive a favourable costs order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Under rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force immediately before 15 October 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> if the Court in its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Court shall order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made. The hearing of the ancillary matters before me was not one to which any of the usual reasons (for departing from the principle that costs should follow the event) applied. As the Wife had substantially succeeded in obtaining the share of the Joint Assets that she was seeking, and as the Husband was also ordered to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife in satisfaction of Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife was the successful party at the hearing of the ancillary matters, and should therefore in principle be awarded the costs of that hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Wife and the Husband filed 2 affidavits each. These were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     PA1 (16 pages of statements and 126 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)     PA2 (5 pages of statements and 6 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_c\"></a>(c)     DA1 (7 pages of statements and 174 pages of exhibits); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_d\"></a>(d)     DA2 (8 pages of statements and 87 pages of exhibits).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The main hearing of the ancillary matters on 14 January 2025 lasted from 2:30 pm to 3:13 pm. The short hearing was made possible by the prior filing of a 14-page written submission on behalf of the Wife (the page count excludes the cover page, the table of contents and the Annex to the written submissions) and a 13-page written submission on behalf of the Husband (the page count excludes the cover page). This was followed by a hearing on 21 January 2025 lasting from 8:30 am to 9:35 am, at which I delivered an oral judgment and received submissions on the form that the order for maintenance should take and on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     All things considered, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the costs of the ancillary matters fixed at $1,500 all in. I also ordered the Husband’s counsel to personally bear the costs of adjournment on 18 December 2024, fixed at $100.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraphs 2 and 6(b), and DA2 paragraphs 2 and 6(b).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3 and Annex A, DA1 paragraph 3, and DA2 paragraph 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraphs 3 and 4 and Annexes A and D.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex C, DA1 paragraph 12, and DA2 paragraph 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex B.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See PA1 Section B paragraph 9 and Annex F.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraph 12.

Both the Mother and the Father were unrepresented at the hearing before me. The Mother had one witness at the hearing: her current Husband (“X”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I reserved judgment after hearing oral submissions from both parties. On 2 April 2025, I delivered judgment, dismissing the Mother’s application. These are my grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The law makes it clear that to succeed in an application for a PPO, the applicant must establish two things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       First, that the respondent had committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that the respondent was likely to commit family violence. What this means is that the applicant does not actually have to show that the respondent had committed family violence – rather, it is sufficient to show that the respondent was likely to do so: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Second, the applicant must show that the PPO is “necessary for the protection” of the family member that is sought to be protected. This is, in essence, a risk assessment: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [70] citing <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. The court will consider factors such as the likelihood of interactions between the parties, whether the underlying cause for family violence remains unresolved, and respondent specific factors (<em>eg</em> where the respondent has displayed a propensity for violence).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The applicant must establish both these aforementioned elements on a balance of probabilities. As to what the “balance of probabilities” means, a useful definition may be found in <em>Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22830-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 145</a> where the Court of Appeal observed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65    Proof on a balance of probabilities is a standard of proof that is applied in civil cases generally to discern whether a past event happened. Such proof is necessary for the court to determine “whether [the plaintiff’s] case is more probably true than untrue” (see Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at para 12.092). <b>In the absence of an exhaustive historical record, the notion that an event was more likely than not to have happened is an epistemic proxy for whether it did in fact happen…</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is with these principles in mind that I turn now to consider the Mother’s application in SS 1477.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Alleged incidents of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 29 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The latest incident of family violence which the Mother complained of took place on the 29<sup>th</sup> of July 2024. This was the Mother’s account of events as set out in her complaint form.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to the Mother, when she was arriving at her parent’s residence, she saw the Father grabbing the son forcefully by his shoulder. At this time, the Mother’s niece was next to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother was shocked to see the Father. Although there was a court order granting care and control of the son to her, the order also provided for the Father to have access. However, the Father had to give two weeks advance notice. The Mother says that the Father never gave such notice and would simply turn up unannounced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother confronted the Father as to where he was taking the son. The Father ignored her and simply asked why she cared before heading off with both the son, and the Mother’s niece, to the carpark.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Not wanting to confront the Father (because she was pregnant at the time and thus feared for her safety), the Mother went up to her parent’s home to ask why the Father had taken the son. Her parents told her that they were unaware of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Afraid that the Father would take the son away to Malaysia, given that he had mentioned doing so previously, the Mother called X for help. X sought police assistance and made his way down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     When the Mother went down to the foot of the block, she saw the Father “provoking and instigating” her Husband to a fight with “vulgar actions and verbal abuse”. The Mother called out to the son and her niece to come with her. The Father, and his girlfriend, pulled the son away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father kept mocking and taunting the Mother’s family members. The Mother claimed that the Father had grabbed the son by the neck, which caused the son “fear and hurt”. The son was traumatised and “started crying all the way”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother pleaded with the Father to let the son go. The Father refused. He continued to hurl insults and instigated X to fight him. The Mother alleges that the Father was “behaving like a wild insane person as he has always done before”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     X began to record the incident. This deescalated the situation somewhat, although the Father continued to “grab on” to the son’s neck.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     When asked to let go of the son, the Father pulled the son “even tighter” and told the Mother to keep her hands off the son otherwise he would hit her. The Mother says that this caused “fear in [the] son, [her] niece and other family members” as she was “26 weeks pregnant” and “all feared that [the Father] would harm [her] and [the] baby”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The situation was defused when the police arrived on the scene. The Mother says the officers advised her to apply for a PPO after hearing why they had called for police assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I do not find that the Father had committed an act of family violence on the son in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother had produced a set of images and videos which were taken by X. The images and videos show a tiny snippet of what had taken place during that incident. It was clear that the son had, unfortunately, been caught up in the heated argument between the Father, and the Mother and her relatives (including X). Both sides were shouting at each other, and any verbal abuse which the Father had hurled, was certainly not directed at the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As to the Mother’s specific allegation that the Father had held the son by his neck during this incident, I do not find this to be the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For one, the Mother had considerable difficulty describing exactly how the Father had allegedly grabbed the son by the neck. Initially, the Mother said:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Yes. And my son’s face was frozen up because when I called---when <b>I called him then he was actually holding my son over the neck, like over the shoulder like that.</b> So, I’m not so sure what was that. So, when I went back home then my ha---uh, I called my husband immediately, then my sister also realised that, uh, it was not a access date or---so, she went down to bring my son back, lah. And I also went down together to see---to bring my son back. Then what I noticed is I saw---uh, my hus---when my husband arrived, I saw my husband below also, ah. So, I saw [the Father] is like, you know, scolding my husband in vulgarities. <b>He was holding my son’s neck like that, grabbing my son neck when I saw him also, ah.</b> So, I---he was---and scolding my husband vulgarities and taunting him to fight in front of the child, lah. Then I---immediately I went in front of him and---and told him, “Please leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. That I’m here already, I’m the mother, I’m here already. You let him go.” But he insists not to let go, and he asked me to move away before he hit me. I’m actually pregnant that time, ah. I was 7, 8 months pregnant, lah. So, he was saying that he will hit me if I come nearer or touch my son. So, my husband was a bit---my husband was very, uh, upset with this, ah. Then my mum also came down because it was a big commotion down---it was so loud, the neighbour also was there. And he was dragging [the son] by the neck, pulling him here and there, not letting him go. So, I was like wondering why he’s doing this? But when I want to approach him, he keep on saying that he will hit me and hit me, ah. Then, uh, he keep on, like, you know, mocking, threatening, you know, all this, what he used to do he was doing it on that day, ah. He---he stopped when the police arrived. Until then he was just dragging my son here and there. So, this was---happened on that day, huh, then, uh--- yah, then my husband took a video and some shots like, uh, some shots that he’s been---he threatening my son and scolding my son, and---and he also like, uh, telling me that he will hit me, repeating again and again, approaching me. The girlfriend was actually stopping him, ah. In the video, you can see, yah. Then, uh, when I went back home, I had a conversation with my son. So, my son was actually very traumatised by the incident. I’m calmed him down and you know, we had a talk over this incident. He was saying that he was very upset. I asked him why---like when I was---I saw you below under the lift why didn’t you just come? Then he said that he was grabbing him very hard here, not letting him go. Then he---he also very worried that he might harm me. So, because I’m also pregnant. So, he---he’s very scared he will harm me so, he just followed him. Then when, uh---then he said that---uh, he was very upset that he was not letting him go when he was---<b>he was grabbing during the incident when he saw my husband, right, so, he was in pain also, ah</b>. So, the next day he didn’t go to school because he was very traumatised that he will appear again and create this, uh---this, uh, this unpleasant scene again, ah. So, he was very scared to open the door also then, uh, I let him rest. He was---he was very, um, threatened and he was full of fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     However, it soon became apparent that there were gaps in the Mother’s memory when she was asked to describe, in detail, how the Father had grabbed the son by the neck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even if one accounts for the erosion of memory with the passage of time, one cannot ignore the context in which the Father had allegedly grabbed the son by the neck. It was clear that this had taken place amidst a heated quarrel between the Father, the Mother and her relatives. The videos and the images that had been produced showed that there was a tussle over the son, and the Father was trying to hold on to him by his left shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Considering the above-mentioned points together, I found it highly unlikely that the Father had grabbed the son by the neck, in a manner that would have caused the son hurt, as the Mother had alleged. In my judgment, this incident on 29 July 2024 was a dispute over whether the Father was entitled to see the son pursuant to the access order. Simmering tempers had boiled over and erupted into a full-blown argument, with both sides shouting at each other and tussling over the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 11 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this incident, the Mother alleges that the Father had made a phone call to her parent’s house, knowing that the son was there. The Father had scolded the son and asked why he did not want to stay overnight with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The son had told the Father that he was afraid of being beaten by him if he stayed overnight. The Mother intervened when she saw the son crying and shivering in fear. She told the Father that the son did not want to stay overnight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father was incensed. He began to hurl vulgarities at the Mother over the phone. The Mother hung up. At this point, the son had gone to close the house door, fearing that the Father would turn up to cause trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Mother says that the Father had, through his actions, placed the son in fear of hurt. She also alleges that his actions constitute continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Father’s account is markedly different. He says that the son was not speaking properly to him when he called. He asked the son to ask the Mother why he could not come and see him on his birthday. The son kept quiet for a while, and then began to cry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     That was when the Mother picked up the phone. The first thing she asked was: “why did you make my son cry?”. The Father was puzzled. He said he did not know. He also confronted the Mother for interrupting the conversation he was having with the son. The both of them started arguing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I do not find that the Mother had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Father had committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother’s evidence of what the Father had said to the son, and the manner in which he had spoken to the son was based on what she claims the son had told her. The Mother testified that she had asked the son what the Father had said to him, and the son had shared that the Father was forcing him to stay with him overnight, and was scolding him harshly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The basic point is that the Mother did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son. She had only seen the son crying, before she stepped in to intervene. She did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son, nor did she hear how the Father had spoken to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Even if I were inclined to accept the Mother’s account, that this was how the Father had spoken to the son and that he had tried to force the son to stay overnight with him, this would not, in my judgment, constitute family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961. One might say that the Father should have, and could have, handled his disappointment at his son’s refusal to stay overnight with him a little better. But the mere act of scolding the son for refusing to stay overnight, and trying to force him to do so, does not, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 24 October 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The next incident complained of happened on 24 October 2023 – this happened a day before the son’s birthday. The Mother claims that the Father had called the son and shouted at him. The Mother also claims that the Father had told the son that he was going to kill her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I do not find that the Mother had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Father had actually told the son that he was going to kill her, or that the Father had indeed shouted at the son. Again, the Mother did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 6 November 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I deal next, with the incident on 6 November 2023. The Mother’s complaint is that the Father had gotten angry when she rejected his requests for access to the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She says that she had rejected his request for access because the son was uncomfortable being with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father had not committed any family violence on the son in this incident. The crux of the Mother’s complaint was that the Father had gotten very angry when his request for access was denied. There is nothing, even on the face of the Mother’s complaint, to suggest that the Father had done anything to the son on the 6th of November 2023. In any event, it is evident, from both the Father’s and the Mother’s account, that the Father did not speak to the son on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father was likely to commit family violence on the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Having dealt with the specific incidents complained of, I move now to consider whether it is likely that the Father would commit family violence on the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I do not find that the Father is likely to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     While the Mother had sought to characterise the Father as a violent individual, the evidence put before me had not gone so far as to establish that any propensity for violence that the Father may have had would make it likely that he would commit family violence on the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, while it was alleged that the Father was physically abusive towards the son (for example, the Mother alleged that the Father would hit the son with a belt), there was no evidence put before me to corroborate this (<em>ie</em>, medical reports showing that the son had been physically abused).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Finally, both the Mother and X had given evidence about the Father’s drinking habits. Specifically, the Mother had given evidence that the Father would get drunk, and when he did, he would lose all sense and control and become violent. Even accepting that the Father does have a drinking problem, and would turn violent when he becomes drunk, there was no evidence before me to suggest that this posed a demonstrable risk to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the contrary, the video which the Father had put in evidence, in my judgment spoke to the affection he had for his son. While I am conscious of the possibility that the son may have been encouraged to act as though he was happy in front of the camera, I do not find that to be the case. The son’s demeanour in the video does show that both the Father and the son were genuinely happy in each other’s company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether it was necessary to order a PPO </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In considering the necessity of ordering a PPO, it is well established that the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment as to the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence on the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In the present case, I did not consider it necessary to order a PPO. For one, the present arrangement was that the son would live with the Mother and her family, and the Father would have access. The Father is allotted a period of time every week to see the son. If there were any signs of family violence on his part, that would be easily picked up when the son is returned to the Mother upon the end of the Father’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Further, I do not find any hint of animosity or ill will directed by the Father towards the son. As I have mentioned, it was apparent to me from the video the Father had produced, that he does, indeed, love his son. One other piece of evidence pointing to this conclusion was the Father’s recollection of happy moments he had spent with his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I thus dismissed the Mother’s application in SS 1477. I would add that if one takes a step back and considers the evidence in totality, the real dispute at hand was over access arrangements to the son. It was clear to me that there was considerable frustration on both the Father’s and Mother’s part as to the practical aspects of the access arrangements as reflected in the court order. That had led to repeated arguments between them. The son had, unfortunately, been caught in the middle, and that thus gave rise to the basis for the Mother’s complaint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will conclude with some brief remarks to the Mother and the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     You are both an important part of your son’s life. While you may have chosen to each go your own separate ways after the divorce, your son is inextricably bound to the both of you by ties of kinship. That means you have but one choice: you must work together to give your son the best possible start in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The law makes it abundantly clear that parenting is a joint obligation. I would strongly encourage the both of you to take this opportunity to start on a clean slate – set aside your differences, and see how you can both work together for the sake of your son.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 2 at p 18, lns 22 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at pp 9 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at pp 12 – 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 2 at pp 31 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript Day 1 at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript Day 1 at pp 34 – 35.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Equity – Defences – Acquiescence","Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-05-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1306, 1308 and 1462 of 2024","title":"XMS v XMR and other matters","citation":"[2025] SGFC 56","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33324-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband in person and unrepresented","Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Hanipah (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) and Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-06-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XMS v XMR and other matters</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XMS <em>v</em> XMR and other matters </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33324-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 56</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1306, 1308 and 1462 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband in person and unrepresented; Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Hanipah (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) and Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XMS — XMR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Equity</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Defences</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Acquiescence</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties to these applications are Husband and Wife. They have three young children aged 14, 12 and 5. These were their respective applications that came before me:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 1306/2024 (“SS 1306”). This was the Wife’s application. She sought a PPO for herself. The Husband is the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 1462/2024 (“SS 1462”). This was the Wife’s application. She sought a PPO for the three children. The Husband is the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS 1308/2024 (“SS 1308”). This was the Husband’s application. He sought a PPO for himself as well as the three children. The Wife is the respondent. In addition, the Husband also seeks a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”), to exclude the Wife from the matrimonial property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of all three matters. The Husband was self-represented. The Wife was initially represented by Mr Abdul Rahman, and subsequently, by Mr Patrick Fernandez (“Mr Fernandez”) who took over conduct of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the trial, I reserved judgment and directed parties to file written submissions. I delivered judgment on 29 April 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These are the applicable legal principles relating to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To succeed in an application for a PPO, the applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, two things (see <em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a> at [5] – [9]). First, that the respondent had committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that the respondent was likely to commit family violence. Second, that it was necessary for the court to order the PPO. In assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There was, however, one other point which I had to consider. Both the Husband’s application in SS 1308, and the Mother’s application in SS 1306 were also premised on incidents that took place a decade ago. In light of this, I called for written submissions on whether acquiescence could be invoked in the context of an application under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Mr Fernandez argued, in relation to the Wife’s application, that acquiescence does not apply to a PPO application based on continual harassment. That is because, to establish continual harassment, the applicant must show that the acts complained of are sufficiently repetitive in nature. Application of acquiescence would therefore “prejudice every PPO application based on continual harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In this connection, Mr Fernandez argued that applying the law on acquiescence would also limit the court’s ability to determine whether “family violence is likely to be committed”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Fernandez, however, argued that acquiescence should apply to the Husband’s application, given his allegations that the Wife had caused him hurt, or placed him in fear of hurt. In this connection, Mr Fernandez argues that the Husband’s inaction to “file a PPO application for an incident that occurred between 2023 and 2025 constituted a waiver or an abandonment of rights”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I take, as my starting point, the concept of acquiescence as has been sketched out in our local jurisprudence. This was a point recently canvassed by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <em>Salaya Kalairani v Appangam Govindhasamy</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30736-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 40</a>, and a useful summary may be found in that judgment at [49] – [56].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In particular, the court noted (at [55]) that cases such as <em>Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0030.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 30</a>, <em>Genelabs Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0530.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 530</a>, and <em>Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22066-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 333</a> appeared to illustrate that acquiescence could be used as a defence against statutory claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The court also noted (at [56]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    In this context we note that the term acquiescence has been used in varying contexts by many courts and for that reason has been described as possessing “a chameleon-like quality” (see <em>Orr v Ford</em> [1989] 84 ALR 146 at 157) or a “mongrel concept that is drawn from other doctrines, but does not have a distinct breed of its own” (see Lusina Ho, “The Importance of Being Earnest: The Doctrines of Laches and Acquiescence” in <em>Defences in Equity</em> (Paul S Davies, Simon Douglas and James Goudkamp eds (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2018) at p 326). For the purposes of these grounds of decision, we define acquiescence as the Court of Appeal defined it in <em>Sakae Holdings</em>, as circumstances founding an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights. In <em>Sakae Holdings</em>, the Court of Appeal held at [188] that “<b><u>[t]he essence of acquiescence is that a plaintiff who knows about the conduct which it complains of and yet does nothing to object to or prevent such conduct may be taken to have made a representation to the defendant that it does not object to that conduct, which representation may found an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights</u></b>” [emphasis added]. Therefore, in considering whether acquiescence was made out on the facts, we considered the key question to be whether the plaintiffs had made a representation which may found an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Adopting the definition of acquiescence as set out by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <em>Sakae Holdings</em> and affirmed by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <em>Salaya</em>, it appears, at first blush, that acquiescence could be invoked in the context of applications for PPOs. Simply put: if an applicant is aware of incidents of family violence, but takes no steps to file an application for a PPO until several years have passed, this conduct could be taken as representing that the applicant has no objection to such conduct, and this representation may found either an estoppel, a waiver or abandonment of rights (to borrow the words used by the CA in <em>Sakae Holdings</em>). For example, such a representation could amount to a waiver in that the applicant had “voluntary[ily] or intentional[ly] relinquish[ed] a known right,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> claim or privilege”: <em>Salaya</em> at [58] citing <em>Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21409-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 317</a> at [54].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     However, that a representation had been made by the applicant in choosing not to file an application for a PPO is only half of the equation. As was noted in <em>Salaya</em> at [65], there must also be reliance by the defendant. In the familial context of PPO applications, one might argue that such reliance could manifest in the form of the defendant taking active steps to correct their behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     That being said, I do not find that acquiescence is applicable in the context of PPO applications under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     It must be remembered that family violence typically occurs in the context of our most intimate and personal relationships. There are reasons why one might be hesitant to file an application for a PPO – to quote the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Sun Xueling (Second Reading of the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and other Matters) (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2023) vol 95):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The third cause as to why family violence is complex is because it often happens behind closed doors which makes it harder to detect. <b><u>Survivors may hesitate to seek help due to shame, stigma, fear of breaking up their family and the perception that family violence is a personal matter. Similarly, individuals who observe family violence may remain as passive bystanders because they also consider it a private family matter.</u></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In this vein, I would add that the architecture of the family violence provisions impliedly excludes the application of acquiescence (see also the reasoning of the court in <em>Teh Siew Hua v Tan Kim Chiong</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0123.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 123</a> at [46]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> For one, there is no time bar as to when an application under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961 may be brought. This is consistent with the various speeches made in Parliament over the years which demonstrate a clear parliamentary intent to encourage victims of family violence to avail themselves of the PPO regime.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Second, the sort of conduct that is dealt with by acquiescence is already captured by the requirement of necessity. For example, the court will consider whether the act of family violence is a recent occurrence: <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [46(b)(ii)]. In particular, the courts have declined to issue a PPO where “a significant amount of time had passed (since the family violence) by the time of the hearing”: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20(b)] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [38] (more than two years had lapsed); <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“GFS”) at [113] (between one to 17 years had lapsed); <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> (“VFM”) (more than two years had lapsed) at [79].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For these reasons, I do not find that the equitable defence of acquiescence may be invoked in the context of applications for a PPO under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961. To do so would be to go against the very spirit of those provisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 1306 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I turn now to first deal with the Wife’s application in SS 1306. The essence of her application is based on the fourth definition of family violence found in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Her case is that the Husband had, by his actions, committed continual harassment “with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish” to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To establish that there was “continual harassment”, the following three requirements must be established (<em>XFL</em> at [37]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Wife had indeed established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband’s conduct over the years, amounted to continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     First, there is the incident in 2015 in which the Wife says the Husband had not only harassed her by saying that he wanted to marry another woman, but that he had also pushed her when she was pregnant, causing her to fall, and subsequently, miscarry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband does not deny having done so. His explanation, rather, is that he cannot be responsible for this because of black magic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I do not accept his explanation. As was noted by the court in <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [103], although “[a]llegations of black magic have from time to time been raised in criminal cases…the Courts have not recognised black magic as a defence”. I would also add that insofar as the Husband also says that he is not responsible for what had happened in 2015 because he was “sick and mentally unstable”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> he had not adduced any evidence to prove this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this connection, I would add that the fact that the Husband had pushed the Wife, and caused her to fall (which, as I noted above, he does not deny), would fall within the definition of family violence. By doing so, the Husband had caused hurt to the Wife “by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Second, the Wife also alleges that the Husband would not only insult her, but also use religious teachings to “gaslight” her into thinking that she was “wrong in the eyes of the [r]eligion”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I find that the text messages which the Husband had sent to the Wife did constitute continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     There was a screenshot of a text message from the Husband. The messages show the Husband comparing the Wife to another woman, whom he described as being much “[more] responsible [and] lovely”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Husband also went on to verbally insult the Wife in the subsequent messages, calling her “selfish”, “irresponsible”, “stupid”, and “stubborn”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In another series of text messages,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> the Husband had sent some religious teachings to the Wife. To be absolutely clear, I express no view as to the correctness of those religious teachings. What is apparent to me, however, is the Wife’s response: she expressed her frustration with the Husband and made it clear that his conduct was causing her stress, and that if he continued to cause her stress, she would have to speak with her lawyer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Then there is also what the Husband had set out in his own affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He does admit to sending the Wife religious teachings, but with the intention of “being grateful on all that we have achieved” and that the Wife had misconstrued his actions as “harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     That being said, as I have noted above (at [28]), the Wife did express her frustration with the Husband sending her religious teachings during a time where she was clearly under immense stress and pressure, and especially when their marital relations were under strain. It is thus apparent, to me, that the Husband must have known that continuing to send her such messages, in these circumstances, would cause her no small amount of unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I thus find that the Husband’s actions did amount to continual harassment. I also find it likely that the Husband will commit family violence on the Wife in that he will likely continue to harass her. For one, it is clear to me that while both the Husband and the Wife share the same religion, their perspectives are rather different. But it is not this difference that is in issue – rather, it is how the Husband manages and responds to the Wife’s different perspective of their shared religion. For instance, according to the Husband, he can still find no basis, in the religious teachings, for his Wife initiating divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Then there are also several audio recordings. The transcripts of these recordings detail arguments between the Husband and Wife. Those transcripts are telling. They are filled with much bitterness and vitriol. They demonstrate that the Husband lacks a healthy way of expressing the difference in religious viewpoints and is unable to bring himself to find common ground with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As to the necessity of ordering the PPO, I find that it is indeed necessary to do so in the present case. It appears to me that parties are going through an acrimonious divorce, and as I had observed above, one risk factor in the present case is how the Husband manages and responds to the Wife’s different perspective on their shared religion which in turn, affects how he deals with any conflict that arises between the both of them. It is also apparent to me, and I accept the Wife’s evidence in this regard, that the Husband is not only upset by the pending divorce proceedings, but has acted in a way that affects her negatively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Further, both the Husband and the Wife are still staying together.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> That they both still continue to share a common space makes it likely that they will continue to interact, and this, in my judgment, increases the risk of further incidents of family violence occurring.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the circumstances, I allow the Wife’s application in SS 1306. In addition, I am also ordering that they both go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 1462 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I turn now to consider the Wife’s application in SS 1462. She seeks a PPO on behalf of the three children against the Husband. She points to several audio and video recordings which she says demonstrates that the Husband had indeed committed family violence against the children, or that he was indeed likely to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In assessing whether the Husband had committed family violence on the children, or was likely to do so, one point I had to consider was whether the “correction exception” applied. That is because the definition of family violence excludes “any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age”. As I had noted in <em>XBC v XBD</em> at [14], the correction exception reflects parliamentary intent to afford parents “a wide degree of discretion when it comes to disciplining their children”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In assessing whether the acts complained of did fall within the correction exception, the court will consider: <b>a)</b> the reasons for the punishment, <b>b)</b> the nature of the punishment and <b>c)</b> the age and personal characteristics of the child: <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Of all the video and audio recordings submitted by the Wife, two videos stand out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In the first video, the Husband can be heard shouting angrily at the eldest son. The video also shows a blue, square shaped object, being flung across the ground at the eldest son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The second video shows the Husband aggressively manhandling the eldest son by grabbing his robes and lifting him off the ground in a rough manner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Husband can be seen raising his voice at and berating the eldest son. The video also shows the Husband taking the prayer mat and hurling it at the eldest son twice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife explained that the Husband was angry with the eldest son for not being properly attired when conducting his prayers. She explained that this was not a one-off occurrence, and that the Husband would scold the children when they did not perform their prayers properly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Wife also said that she had tried to tell the Husband repeatedly to not discipline the children in this manner, but he had refused to listen to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In his written submissions, the Husband attempts to downplay the manner in which he had disciplined his eldest son. He says that he had merely lifted the eldest son and put him down.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I find that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence on the children in such a manner that disentitles him from relying on the correction exception. While the Husband is well within his rights to inculcate religious values in the children, and to correct them when they have veered off course, I find that the manner in which he has chosen to discipline them has gone beyond the pale. In particular, the second video shows the Husband aggressively manhandling the eldest son. I also accept the Wife’s evidence, that the two videos that I have described (above at [39] – [40]), are symptomatic of the discipline which the Husband metes out to the children when they do not perform their prayers properly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I also find it necessary to order the PPO for the three children. It is apparent to me that the Husband has little insight into his own parenting methods, and sees no issues with how he chooses to discipline them. Absent such insight, I consider it likely that the Husband would continue to discipline his children in such a manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     For the reasons I have set out above, the Wife’s application in SS 1462 is allowed. I must emphasise that, in allowing the Wife’s application, I am not making a finding that the Husband is a bad father who does not want the best for the children. What I have found is that the Husband’s methods of disciplining the children, when considered in context of the child’s alleged misbehaviour, crosses the line laid down by the law. I have also found that because the Husband is likely to continue with such methods of disciplining the children, it is necessary to order the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this connection, I am also ordering that the Husband go for counselling so as to equip him with better methods of disciplining the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband’s application in SS 1308 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband seeks a PPO for himself and the three children against the Wife. He also seeks a DEO to exclude the Wife from the entirety of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I shall deal first with the Husband’s application for a PPO for himself. I find that the Wife had indeed committed family violence against the Husband, in particular, that she had caused hurt to him “by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt” (to borrow the language of limb b of the definition of family violence set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961). I also find it likely that the Wife will commit family violence on the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     First, the Wife admitted, in her affidavit and testimony in court,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> to slapping the Husband on the face. She says that she was frustrated with the Husband because he had gone to someone’s fiancé and asked for her hand in marriage. In my judgment, the Wife’s act of slapping the Husband was an act of family violence in that she ought to have known, minimally, that slapping him would have caused him hurt (<em>ie</em>, bodily pain)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Second, there was also the incident on 2 July 2024. The Husband had complained of this incident. He alleges that in this incident, the Wife had hit him 3 – 4 times on the head with her phone. He also alleges that the Wife had spit on him 3 – 4 times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     It was disputed as to whether the Wife had used her hands to hit the Husband, or whether she had hit him on the head with her phone. Mr Fernandez had cross-examined the Husband strenuously on this point.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> It was also hotly disputed whether the Husband had done an X-ray scan to check for any head injuries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I find that the Wife had indeed caused hurt to the Husband in this incident on 2 July 2024. For one, in her affidavit, the Wife did admit to hitting the Husband and spitting at him. She states:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The Husband] stopped me from leaving the house by standing in front of the door preventing me from leaving the house. This angered me further which caused me to spit at him and hit him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife also confirmed, under cross-examination, that she had indeed hit the Husband and spit at him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> She also admitted that she had hurt the Husband in this incident, but explained that she had done so because she wanted to leave the house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In any event, I also find it likely that the Wife will commit family violence on the Husband. It is clear to me that she has built up a deep resentment and anger towards the Husband for how he has treated her over the past 15 years of their marriage. For instance, this was what she had said when the Husband had cross-examined her:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.3%\"><col width=\"80.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I have to remind you that this is affirmed on the 6th September, that you make this statement.

She does not deny slapping and hitting him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     As to the necessity of ordering a PPO, I find that it is indeed necessary to do so. The risk factors which I have pointed out above (at [33] – [34]) are equally applicable to the Husband’s case. It was clear to me that their marriage was not a happy one, and this was only exacerbated by the fact that the both of them were unable to communicate their needs and settle their differences in a healthy and productive manner. Given their pending divorce, and the fact that they are still both living together under one roof, this would only create further opportunities for friction and further incidents of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I turn now to consider whether a PPO should be granted in favour of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Mr Fernandez argued, in written submissions, that the Wife did not, and was not likely to commit family violence on the children. The first prong of the argument is that the Wife was entitled to rely on the correction exception – that her use of force was justified given that she was disciplining the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The second prong of the argument is that the Husband never witnessed the past incidents of family violence that he alleges the Wife had committed on the children, and that the injuries he claims they sustained were from the rough and tumble of children playing, and not from any abuse on the Wife’s part.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Having examined the evidence, I find that the Wife was indeed likely to commit family violence on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the incident on 2 July 2024, the Wife discovered that the daughter had fallen victim to a scam. The Wife discovered this when she checked her phone bill and found that she had been billed about $500. After questioning the daughter, she discovered that the daughter had shared the one-time password with an unknown person. She also discovered that the daughter had been hiding this from her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Wife, in her testimony, admitted to slapping the daughter and hitting her on the thigh area with a hanger.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> It was, however, clear to me that the Wife had done so, not with the intention of disciplining the daughter, but out of sheer anger and frustration.

This left a dent in the wall. The Wife admits having thrown the stool at the wall.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It was clear to me, from this incident, that the Wife was under strain from having to pay the bills. That the daughter had been the victim of a scam only added to her financial burden. While one can understand the pressures that the Wife must have been facing, this does not, and cannot, condone her actions. It is clear from her own testimony that she had vented her frustration on the daughter by hitting her with the hanger and slapping her. Apart from that, the Wife’s action of hurling the stool at the living room wall, not only spoke to her inability to deal with her frustration, but also demonstrated her disregard for how her actions might frighten her children who had to bear witness to her outward displays of anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In addition to this, there is also evidence that the Child Protective Services (“CPS”) had become involved in the wake of the incident that had taken place on 2 July 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> That CPS had become involved, in my judgment, also demonstrated that it was indeed likely that the Wife would commit family violence on the children. The report exhibited in the Wife’s affidavit showed that CPS was concerned with how the Wife had behaved towards the daughter in the incident on 2 July 2024. CPS was also concerned that the children would be triangulated in the conflict between the Husband and Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I also find it necessary to order the PPO for the three children. As I have explained, the Wife’s actions were driven by her inability to regulate her emotions and to deal with the stresses she faced. Given the ongoing divorce proceedings, it is likely that the Wife will continue to encounter such pressures in her life. Coupled with her lack of a coping mechanism and proper tools to manage her emotions, it is likely that she may overreact when the children misbehave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To be clear, my finding that the Wife is likely to commit family violence on the children should not, and must not, be taken as an indictment of her as a mother. Simply put, my finding is that the Wife does not have a healthy way of dealing with her own emotions and challenges that she may encounter, and that this was likely to result in her venting her frustration on the children. It may be the case that (and one certainly hopes for such an outcome) both the Husband and the Wife learn how to better manage their emotions and how to interact with their children in a healthy manner. When this day comes, and there is evidence to support such change on the part of the Husband and the Wife, there may certainly be grounds for the PPO to be revoked. Until then, however, a PPO is indeed necessary to ensure that the children are safe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In this vein, I would also order the Husband, the Wife, as well the eldest son and the daughter to go for counselling. Such an order is necessary to ensure that they have the necessary resources to deal with their emotions and the stresses they may face, especially when navigating the ongoing divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Finally, I deal with the Husband’s application for a DEO. Based on the evidence before me, I do not find it necessary to order a DEO to exclude the Wife entirely from the matrimonial home. I do not find the Wife to have such a violent temperament such that she needs to be excluded from the matrimonial home to ensure the safety of the Husband as well as the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In summary, the Wife’s applications in SS 1306 and 1462 are allowed in its entirety. The Husband’s application in SS 1308 for a PPO for himself and the three children are also allowed, but his application for a DEO is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Finally, I conclude with some brief remarks to both the Husband and Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Stop fighting. You have come to court, and I have made a decision on your applications. Take this opportunity to start afresh. Move on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Spare a thought for your children. Your continued conflict at home will only serve to negatively affect them. They are bright children with much potential: I have seen, exhibited in your affidavits, a picture of them receiving Edusave awards. You owe it, to all three of them, to help them realise their potential, and to give them the best possible start in life. You can do so by setting aside your differences and learning to work together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Take the counselling seriously. Attend all the scheduled sessions and learn what you can from the counsellor.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Unless otherwise stated, references to provisions of the Women’s Charter are references to the relevant provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.

The PPO has been sought to protect the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     His son (born in October 2016), and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     His daughter (born in January 2018).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed in his PPO application, the Husband must satisfy two requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he must prove that the Wife had committed or is likely to commit <em>“family violence” –</em> defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter (“<b>Charter</b>”) – against the children and himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband must also prove that a PPO is <em>necessary</em> to protect the children and himself from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband had relied on five incidents to support his PPO application. After a trial, I allowed his application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">27 July 2023 – Caning and hitting the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the first incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       According to the Husband, the Wife had inflicted both “physical and emotional harm on the [son] on 27 July 2023” in the following manner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she had “verbally abused”, hit, and caned the son because of his poor spelling results. The Husband was not at home at the material time. However, he was able to tender a video recording (obtained from a CCTV camera installed at the home) to prove his claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, during the caning, the Wife had injured the son’s left eye and caused it to be bruised and swollen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife’s case is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she was not at home on 27 July 2023 from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. At the material time, she was attending a lecture for her nursing course. She adduced an “attendance” table from the course website to support this claim.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That said, the Wife did not deny that she was the person shown in the video recording. She explained that (i) she was disciplining the son at the material time, (ii) she had used only 10% to 15% of her strength during the caning,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and (iii) her actions did not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Wife vehemently denied having injured the son’s eye. She adduced a medical report (dated 30 July 2023) which stated that it was the daughter who had accidentally poked the son’s eye with a plastic stick while playing with him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given the positions taken by the parties, the issues regarding the 27 July incident are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Did the incident shown in the video recording take place on 27 July 2023?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Did the Wife’s actions towards the son – as shown in the recording – come within the correction exception of “family violence” (“<b>correction exception</b>”)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Did the Wife injure the son’s eye?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident had occurred on 27 July 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Regarding first issue, I find that the incident shown in the video recording did take place on 27 July 2023. These are my reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife had admitted that she is the person shown in the recording. The <em>timestamp</em> in the recording shows the date and time as 27 July 2023 and 3.50 pm respectively. The timestamp contradicts the Wife’s case that she was attending a lecture – and not at home – at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife claimed that the Husband had tampered with the recording. I am unable to accept this claim. The recording was made about <em>10 months before</em> the Husband decided to apply for the PPO against the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> There is simply no reason why he would want to tamper with the timestamp at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Second</em>, one day after the incident (i.e., on 28 July 2023), the Husband had sent a WhatsApp message to the Wife. In that message, he had told her that it was “not right” for her to “continuously hit” the son “<em>yesterday</em>”. In her replies via WhatsApp, the Wife did not deny having hit the child on 27 July 2023. She instead defended her actions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife had committed family violence – Correction exception inapplicable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This brings me to the second (and more important) issue. The Wife’s acts of hitting and caning the son would <em>technically</em> qualify as family violence. Does such conduct come within the correction exception?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On this issue, s 64 of the Charter provides that family violence “does not include any force lawfully used … by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age”. In <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> (“<b><em>XKJ</em></b>”) at [32], I had explained that to successfully invoke the correction exception, a respondent must prove two things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the respondent must prove that the use of force was <em>intended to benefit the child</em> – i.e., to inculcate in the child the appropriate behaviour and attitude (i) in his/her conduct as a person and (ii) in his/her relationship with others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the respondent must also prove that the use of force is <em>neither excessive nor unreasonable</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Has the Wife satisfied the <em>first requirement</em>? In my view, the answer is <em>yes</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a preliminary point, I note that the Wife had given conflicting reasons for caning the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>One day after</em> the incident (i.e., on 28 July 2023), the Wife sent the following WhatsApp messages to the Husband to explain why she had used force on the son:<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <u>Message sent at 10.57 am</u> – “I hit him Cauz he said that study is boring and crying to do (sic) homework”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <u>Message sent at 11.02 am</u> – “... I hit him for his direspect (sic) behaviour and everyday crying to do (sic) homework”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>It appears from the above that the Wife had used force on the son for two reasons. <em>First</em>, for his poor attitude towards his studies. <em>Second</em>, for showing “disrespectful behaviour”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       During the trial (i.e., about <em>17 months after</em> the incident), the Wife gave different reasons for having used force on the son on 23 July 2023. Initially, she testified that it was because he had <em>lied to her</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Upon further examination, the Wife testified that it was because the son had <em>copied during spelling</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I find that each of the Wife’s reasons given on 28 July 2023 and during the trial can provide a basis for punishing the son. Specifically, I am prepared to accept her evidence (i) that the son had been showing a poor attitude towards his studies, (ii) that he done badly in a recent spelling assignment, (iii) that he had copied during spelling, and (iv) that he thus needed to be disciplined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Next, has the Wife satisfied the <em>second requirement</em> to the correction exception? In my view, the answer is <em>no</em>. This is because while she had begun the punishment with an intention to correct the son’s attitude and behaviour, the video recording clearly shows that the execution of her punishment was later fuelled by <em>anger</em>. It is settled law that the use of force on a child in such circumstances falls outside of the correction exception: see <em>XKJ</em> at [32(d)]. Evidence that the Wife had punished the son out of anger include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, at the beginning of the punishment, the Wife had screamed repeatedly, and her demeanour was filled with rage. The son can be seen to be genuinely fearful of her at the material time. Indeed, during the hearing, I observed that the Wife was herself visibly distressed when reviewing the video recording of the punishment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife continued to cane the son even though the latter had apologised for his misbehaviour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, there was a lull period in the punishment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> At about 4.18 pm, the Wife suddenly broke the lull by beginning to cane the son again <em>for no apparent reason</em>. Apart from venting the Wife’s simmering frustration, the caning does not appear to serve any other function.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No evidence that the Wife had injured the son’s eye</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The remaining issue is whether the Wife had injured the son’s eye while caning him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Regarding this issue, I note the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is <em>no</em> evidence – either from the video recording<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> or testimony from the son – to prove that the Wife had caused the injury.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there are two <em>medical reports</em> which contradict the Husband’s claim that the Wife had injured the son’s eye. The first report is based on a consultation about three days after 27 July 2023. (This report is adduced by the Wife.) The second report is based on a consultation about one week prior to 5 August 2023. (This report is tendered by the Husband.)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Both medical reports suggested that the son’s eye injury was caused “accidentally” by a plastic stick.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Despite the above, the Husband submitted that the Wife had injured the son’s eye. The sole basis for this submission is that she had failed to deny such an assertion that is implicit in the following message that he had sent to her one day after the caning incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The son] don’t (<em>sic</em>) deserved to get hit that back (<em>sic</em>) like yest, <em>till hurt his eyes</em> and etc.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis and text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I find that the accusation in the message – that the Wife had injured the son’s eye – is indirect and equivocal. Such an accusation could easily have been missed by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Indeed, the Wife explained that she did not agree or deny the message because she was more focused at the material time on highlighting to the Husband that he had failed to take any responsibility to guide and discipline the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, during cross-examination, the Husband had acknowledged that the Wife did not admit to having injured the son’s eye in her replies to the implicit accusation in the message.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2 April 2024 – Threat to kill the children – Repeated messages to the Husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I now move on to the next incident. It had occurred on 2 April 2024. The following facts regarding that incident are not disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband had suspected that the Wife was having an affair with X. To gather evidence of this, he had installed a voice recorder at the home without her knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 2 April 2024, via phone call over WhatsApp, the Wife had an argument with the Husband regarding the voice recorder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At or around 7.01 pm that day, the Wife sent a message to the Husband stating, “im going to kill myself with my kids” (“<b>Threat over WhatsApp</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Shortly after receiving the message, the Husband reached home. The Wife held a knife and threatened to cut herself (“<b>Threat at Home</b>”). She wanted the Husband to disclose his evidence of the alleged affair. After a tense moment, the situation was defused. The Husband had a voice recording of the Threat at Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The parties disagreed about the circumstances of the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Husband –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Wife had made both threats to compel him to produce his evidence of the alleged affair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Threat at Home was made in the presence of the children and had caused them to be alarmed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       She had made the Threat over WhatsApp under the <em>pressure of the Husband’s accusations</em> of her having an affair. Specifically, he had kept “pushing and bullying her” to admit to the affair. During a WhatsApp phone call that day, he had even asked her to “go and die”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       As for the Threat at Home, the Wife agreed that her intention was to compel the Husband to produce the recording. When making this threat, the children were <em>not</em> present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       It is the Wife’s case that a threat to commit suicide did not constitute “family violence”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This is because she did not cause hurt to the Husband and the children at the material time. She did not wilfully or knowingly place them in fear of hurt. In any event, she did not intend to carry out the threats. If the Husband had played the recording, she would not have made the threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given the parties’ position, the factual issues for determination are

me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the records in [21(1)] to [21(9)] above show that the Wife had <em>initiated</em> multiple communication with the Husband in the 20 min period before sending the Threat over WhatsApp. If the Husband had been verbally abusive and harassing her, why did she initiate such communication?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the messages reveal that the Wife was in fact <em>angry</em> with the Husband at the material time:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       About one minute before sending the Threat over WhatsApp, she had called the Husband “idiot”: see [21(1)] above.

In response to this text, the Wife sent the Threat over WhatsApp. It bears highlighting that she then followed up with a message <em>explaining</em> that she had sent the threat <em>because of</em> his “stupidity”: [21(14)]. The Wife did not make any reference to the Husband’s alleged “pressure” as being the trigger for sending the threat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Wife made it very clear during the trial that she had sent the Threat over WhatsApp and the message at [21(18)] above <em>to get the Husband’s attention</em> – as he was not answering her calls at the material time. She had simply wanted him to play the recording and had no intention to carry out the threat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This shows that the Wife was in fact the one who was exerting pressure at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Children were present when the Threat at Home was made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I find that the children were present when the Wife made the Threat at Home. This is evident from the recording of the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In that recording, the following could be heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children were crying, shouting “Amma” and “Mama”, and pleading, “amma, no amma”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was desperately trying to de-escalate the situation and to get the children away from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Meaning of “family violence”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The next issue is whether the Wife’s threats constitute family violence. In this regard, s 64 of the Charter states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt; [<b>Limb A</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt; [<b>Limb B</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will; [<b>Limb C</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member, [<b>Limb D</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb B and Limb C had not been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Limb B and Limb C are clearly not applicable in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In the case of Limb B, “hurt” has been defined under s 64 to mean “<em>bodily</em> pain, disease or infirmity. This definition would not cover the <em>emotional</em> trauma suffered the Husband and the children because of the threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for Limb C, there is no evidence that the Wife had wrongfully confined or restrained the Husband and children at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This leaves us with Limb A and Limb D to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb A had not been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I start with Limb A. I accept the Wife’s submission that the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home do <em>not</em> fall within Limb A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Threat over WhatsApp involves a threat to cause harm to the children. However, there is no evidence to show that the Wife had intended the message to be read by the children, or that she would have known that the message would be read by them. Accordingly, the Wife did not wilfully or knowingly place, or attempt to place, the children in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Next, the Threat at Home. This involves a threat of <em>self</em>-harm by the Wife. She did not directly or indirectly threaten to harm either the Husband or the children. As such, she similarly did not wilfully or knowingly place, or attempt to place, them in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb D had been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, the Wife had committed family violence under Limb D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, on 2 April 2024, she had sent <em>two</em> messages in which she threatened to commit self-harm and to kill the children: see [21(13)] and [21(18)]. After sending these messages, the Wife <em>repeated</em> her threat to commit self-harm – this time holding a knife in the presence of the Husband and children at home. Such actions had <em>traumatised</em> the Husband and children. In the audio recording of the Threat at Home, the children could be heard crying. The Husband could also be heard trying to calm the Wife down. She clearly knew that her threats had caused anguish to her family members. During the trial, the Wife admitted that it was wrong for her to have picked up a knife at the material time, and that the children ought to have been protected from such trauma.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, earlier in the afternoon of 2 April 2024 (i.e., from 2.26 pm to 7.00 pm), the Wife had also sent to the Husband <em>multiple messages</em> demanding that he must (i) settle “the phone contract” and (ii) meet her at a place and time specified by her for this purpose. The Wife had made these demands despite the Husband informing her that he was busy at work and that he could meet her only after work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The Wife would have known that her barrage of messages, calls, and demands to the Husband while he was at work are likely to cause anguish to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">22 April 2024 – Hitting and caning the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I now turn to the next incident. It is not disputed that on 22 April 2024 at about 8.40 pm, the Wife had caned the children. A video recording from a CCTV camera at home of this incident was admitted into evidence. The Husband was not at home at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The issue regarding the 22 April incident centres on whether the Wife’s use of force on the children comes within the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, a day before the incident, she had already warned the children against using violence towards each other and their domestic helper. Despite this warning, the son had hit the helper and the daughter on 22 April 2024. The daughter had also fought with the son that day. Accordingly, she had caned the children to discipline them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is the Husband’s case that the Wife hit the son because of the daughter’s complaint over a minor matter – the son’s refusal to share a toy with her. The Wife had caned the daughter when the son complained that the daughter had hit his buttocks. The Husband submitted that the Wife’s use of force on the children (i) was unnecessarily severe given that the children merely had a “minor sibling conflict”, (ii) was motivated by “frustration and anger”, and (iii) was inflicted without concern for the children’s welfare and had traumatised them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Having reviewed the video recording, I find that the Wife had failed to prove that the correction exception applies to the 22 April incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reason for the use of force</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I am unable to accept the Wife’s claim that she had used force on the children because they had been physically violent towards each other and to the helper (in the case of the son).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32      <em>First</em>, such a claim is not supported by the video recording of the incident. The recording reveals the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Before the violence started, the children and the helper were in the living room, while the Wife was in the bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For more than a minute <em>before</em> the Wife started to use force on the children, the latter were apparently doing their own things in the living room. The son did not hit the helper and the daughter. Neither did the daughter fight with the son. There was also no verbal altercation between the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife started to use force only after the daughter had gone into the bedroom – apparently to complain to her about the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the complaint, the Wife went to the living room and began hitting the son. During this period, the son said something to her. The word “pigu” (meaning buttocks in Chinese) could be heard. The Wife then turned her attention to the daughter and began caning her repeatedly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>Second</em>, during the trial, the Wife could not recall what was the nature of the daughter’s complaint about the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Third</em>, given that the Wife did not see what the son was doing in the living room at the material time (because she was in the bedroom), there is no basis for her to claim that he had hit the domestic helper and the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In my view, the misbehaviour by the children, if any, is relatively minor. The Wife had failed to show why it is necessary to use force to punish them for such misbehaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Manner the force was used</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Additionally, I find that the Wife’s use of force at the material time had been excessive and unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Despite the relatively minor misbehaviour, the Wife had severely punished the children for about 5 mins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There are several instances when the use of force is <em>clearly gratuitous</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Wife had caned the daughter repeatedly even after the latter (1) had apologised for what she had done, and (2) was screaming and crying in pain from the caning.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       While the Wife’s initial motivation for the use of force might have been to punish the children for misbehaving, she subsequently used the cane to stop them from screaming out in pain from the caning.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Clearly, a more effective way to stop the screaming is to simply stop the caning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Despite the daughter having complied with the instructions to stop screaming, the Wife continued to cane the child. This caused the daughter to further scream in pain.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Caning in such circumstances is clearly unnecessary. The Wife’s actions suggest that she was seeking to assert power and control – rather than discipline – over the children through the infliction of pain: <em>XKJ</em> at [32(d)(iv)].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2 May 2024 – Kicking the Husband’s leg</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I come to the next incident. This took place on 2 May 2024 at about 1.30 am. The incident – which is captured on the CCTV camera recording<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> – occurred after the Wife had just returned home from Malaysia. The Husband was sleeping on the floor in the living room at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     According to the Husband, the Wife had harassed him (a) by kicking his leg repeatedly for about 90 s and (b) by taking away his sling back which contained items such as his wallet and phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife denied having harboured any intention to harass the Husband at the material time. According to her, she had merely nudged him with her leg as she felt pitiful for him to be sleeping on the floor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I find that the Wife’s actions did not amount to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is no evidence that her actions had caused “hurt” to the Husband. Put in another way, the Husband had failed to prove that he had suffered “bodily pain, disease or infirmity” because of the Wife’s actions. Accordingly, Limb A is not engaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband had also failed to bring his case under Limb D. Specifically, there is no evidence that the Wife had intended to cause, or knew that she was likely to cause, anguish to him at the material time. In the video recording, the Wife can be heard saying repeatedly in a normal tone, “Excuse me”, “I need the room”, “I am talking to you”, and “Hello”. The Husband can also be heard in the recording to have said, “Not now”. If the Wife had intended to cause anguish to him, one would have expected her to be more aggressive and forceful in waking him up – e.g., by shouting harshly at him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the recording shows that after failing to rouse the Husband to get up, the Wife took his sling bag and left. Soon thereafter, the Husband looked up in her direction, glanced at the position where his bag used to be placed, and then returned to his sleep. In my view, the Husband must have been aware that the Wife had taken his sling bag. Yet, he did not raise any issue with this at the material time. Neither did he seem to be distressed by the Wife’s actions. It is not inconceivable that the Wife had taken the bag to retrieve her room key, and the Husband was fine with this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">13 to 14 May 2024 – Harassing the Husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I come to the final incident. It is common ground that the parties had an altercation in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024. The altercation revolved around the Wife’s suspicion that the Husband had hacked into her laptop and her phone (“<b>hacking issue</b>”). The parties however gave very different accounts of what had transpired during the altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     According to the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had verbally abused him during the altercation over the hacking issue. At one point, she suddenly slapped his left cheek, leaving him stunned. The Husband remained calm and did not want to be provoked into committing violence against her. When he attempted to leave the home to avoid further conflict, the Wife blocked his path. In response, the Husband told her to leave him alone, or else he would punch her. (He did not have the intention to carry out this threat at the material time.) Despite the threat, the Wife continued to harass him. The Husband did not retaliate. She eventually stopped the harassment at about 2.00 am and went to her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 14 May 2024 at about 6.00 am, as the Husband was getting ready to leave home for work, the Wife resumed her harassment. She refused to let him go to work until the hacking issue was resolved. She followed him when he left the home. When the lift reached the ground floor, the Husband told her that he was going to the police station. At that point, the Wife took his office bag (which contained his laptop) and went home. The Husband did not want to return home to face further harassment. As such, he reported what had happened to the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife denied the Husband’s allegations. According to her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the altercation, the Husband had punched her, kicked her, and pushed her against a cupboard and a wall. He eventually told her that he would discuss the hacking issue the following morning. He then went to sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The next day, the parties left home together to talk about the problems in their marriage. When the lift reached the ground floor, the Husband suddenly ran towards the direction of the police station. In the midst of running, he dropped his office bag in the middle of the road and told her –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“I'm <em>not</em> mentally stable. Don’t make me do stupid things again. I'm going to call the police now and <em>act stupid</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The Wife retrieved the Husband’s office bag and returned home. She later learnt that the Husband had lodged a police report that she had committed violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The altercation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Wife submitted that her account of the altercation should be believed for the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband did not particularise her verbal abuse towards him during the altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife’s alleged abuse did not put the Husband in fear of hurt as he was able to sleep from 2.00 am to 6.00 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband’s claim that she had slapped his cheek during the altercation is a bare allegation. He had failed to produce any photographs, medical reports, or persons who had seen him after the altercation to corroborate his claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the other hand, the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had punched her is supported by an audio recording. In the recording, he could be heard saying, “I’ll punch your face now. Move”. (“<b>Husband’s Remarks</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I am not persuaded by the Wife’s submissions. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The fact that the Husband did not particularise the Wife’s verbal abuse is not fatal to his case. Based on the parties’ case, the altercation was clearly heated – with both sides alleging that family violence had been committed by the other side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s submission that the Husband could sleep after the altercation is also a neutral point. A similar argument can be made against the Wife that she was not in fear of hurt by the Husband at the material time. This is because (i) she had remained at home after he had allegedly assaulted her and (ii) she had chosen to leave the home together with him the next morning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Regarding the lack of evidence to corroborate the Husband’s account of what had happened during the altercation, again, the same point can be made of the Wife’s claim. Specifically, she had failed to produce photographs, medical reports, or persons who had seen her after the altercation to corroborate her claim that the Husband had kicked her and pushed her against a cupboard and a wall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I accept that the Husband’s Remarks can corroborate the Wife’s claim that the Husband had punched her. That said, I find this evidence to be far from conclusive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the remarks can also support the Husband’s evidence that the Wife had <em>blocked his path</em> when he attempted to leave the home to avoid further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband’s Remarks can be construed to be merely a <em>warning</em> of what the Husband might do <em>if</em> the Wife did not stop blocking his path.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, it is unclear from the recording whether the Husband did eventually punch the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the last point, I have doubts regarding the Wife’s claim that the Husband had assaulted her during the altercation. Based on the Wife’s account, the alleged assault would have been extremely violent – she was punched, kicked, and pushed against a cupboard and a wall. Despite this, the Wife did not mention about the assault until recently at the trial. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is the Wife’s case that she has a habit of texting the Husband’s brother (one S) (“<b>Brother-in-Law</b>”) to help solve her marital issues with the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Yet, there is no evidence to show that she had texted the Brother-in-Law for help soon after the alleged assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife also did not promptly file a police report or PPO application against the Husband for the alleged assault. Instead, she filed her police report and PPO application (SS 1138/2024) only on 20 May 2024 and 18 June 2024 respectively. It bears noting that her report and application was filed <em>after</em> – and apparently in response to – the Husband’s PPO application on 15 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, in her police report, the Wife had set out <em>comprehensively</em> her complaint against the Husband. In the report, she accused him of having (1) hacked her electronic devices, (2) stolen her identity card, (3) pawn her jewellery without her consent, and (4) <em>hit her on 26 January 2023</em>. Significantly, there is no mention in the police report that the Husband had assaulted her on in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> If the Wife could recall him having allegedly hit her on 26 January 2023 (i.e., an incident that had occurred about 1½ years before the lodging of the police report), why did she fail to mention the alleged assault during the altercation – which is a more violent and a more recent incident?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, in her PPO application, the Wife had similarly failed to mention the alleged assault during the altercation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Instead, she referred to (1) the hacking issue, (2) the incidents stated in her police report (dated 20 May 2024), (3) the Husband having allegedly slapped the son in March 2023, and (4) an alleged spousal abuse on 26 January 2023. Given that the very purpose of the Wife making the PPO application is to protect herself from family violence by the Husband, why did she fail (again) to mention in her application about the alleged assault in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In contrast, I find that the Husband’s account of the altercation to be more coherent and credible. Additionally, his evidence that the Wife was very aggressive at the material time is consistent with her own evidence that she was “particularly distress[ed]” by the hacking issue at the material time as her nursing course assignments and examinations were just around the corner. The Wife had also believed that the Husband was the culprit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, it is probable that she would have been harsh and confrontational towards the Husband over the hacking issue at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Events when the parties left the home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I now turn to the events when the parties left their home in the morning of 14 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     According to the Wife, the Husband had made two statements at the material time. <em>First</em>, that he was “not mentally stable”. <em>Second</em>, that he would <em>pretend</em> to be “stupid” (presumably, meaning pretend to be mentally <em>un</em>stable) in front of the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I find the Wife’s evidence regarding such alleged statements to be inherently incredible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it appears from the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had <em>suddenly</em> behaved in a bizarre manner. This is no evidence to show what had triggered such alleged behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if the Husband <em>was</em> “mentally stable” and rational at the material time, why did he make the alleged statements? Put in another way, what advantage did he seek to gain by declaring his mental state and intentions to the Wife?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, it is not disputed that the Husband had left home that morning intending to go to work. In the circumstances, there is no reason for him to suddenly leave his laptop bag in the middle of the road while running to the police station. Without his laptop, how would he be able to work?<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Third</em>, if the Husband was “<em>not</em> mentally stable” at the material time, then I have difficulty accepting that he would still have the presence of mind to declare to the Wife his intention to “act stupid” before the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Finally</em>, based on the <em>Wife’s account</em>, the Husband <em>would not have known</em> that she had kept his laptop bag at the material time. This is because according to her, the Husband had suddenly left the bag in the middle of the road while running away from her. Yet, it is <em>not disputed</em> that the Husband knew that his laptop bag was with the Wife at the material time. This is because he had complained to the Police that she had taken his laptop bag. It is also undisputed that the bag was later found in her possession by the Police. Such undisputed facts do not square with the Wife’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Summary – Family violence committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     To sum-up, I find that the Wife had committed family violence against the Husband and the children. Specifically –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had repeatedly caned and hit the son on 27 July 2023. Such use of force was excessive and unreasonable and had gone beyond the limits of the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had also continuously harassed the Husband on 2 April 2024. Initially, the harassment concerned the “phone contract” issue. Later in the evening, she had repeatedly threatened to kill herself and the children. The Wife’s actions had caused alarm and anguish to the Husband and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife had repeatedly hit and caned the children on 22 April 2024. Such actions did not come within the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, the Wife had slapped the Husband’s cheek and continuously harassed him regarding the hacking issue in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024. On 14 May 2024, she had continued the harassment and had also taken his laptop bag when he was going to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Having found that family violence had been committed, the next issue is whether a PPO is necessary to deter the Wife from committing further violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     On this issue, the Wife made several submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Wife loves the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55      <em>First</em>, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because she deeply loves the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     While I do not doubt the Wife’s love for the children, this fact alone does not mean that a PPO is unnecessary. The key issue is whether “family violence is likely to be committed” by the Wife against the children in the future: s 65(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In my view, the answer is yes. The Wife had made it clear during the trial that she did not see anything wrong with her approach to “disciplining” the children. This lack of insight on her part increases the likelihood that she will continue to use excessive and unreasonable force to discipline the children in future. A PPO is needed to remind her to exercise restraint when disciplining them: <em>XKJ</em> at [32(h)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Propensity to threaten harm to self and the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58      <em>Second</em>, the Wife had also submitted that the making of the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... was purely <b>situational in nature</b> and would not arise again. The evidence shows that since April 2024, which was more than a year ago, the [Wife] had not ever threatened nor contemplated suicide again. It will be speculative and against the weight of the evidence to find that the [Wife] would react in a similar fashion in future, when her conduct on that occasion was purely one-off in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[emphasis in original text; text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I am unable to agree with the Wife’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60      <em>First</em>, the mere fact that she has not made further threats of harming either herself or the children after April 2024 is neither here nor there. One possible reason why the Wife had desisted from making further similar threats is that the Husband had applied for a PPO against her on 15 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61      <em>Second</em>, there is ample evidence to show that to get attention and what she wants, the Wife has no qualm about (1) making casual references to death, and (2) threatening to cause harm to herself and/or the children. In addition to the threats made on 2 April 2024, the Wife had also made the following threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During courtship days, there was an occasion where the Wife was hospitalised following a suicide attempt when the Husband wanted to break up with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 28 July 2023, the Wife had sent the following message to the Husband when he pleaded with her that the son did not deserve to be caned for making mistakes in his spelling:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">This is you, u wan us to <em>die</em> at the very last minute ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 22 April 2024 (i.e., just three weeks after the 2 April incident), the Wife had <em>again</em> threatened to kill herself and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       On that day, the Wife had sent the following messages to the Brother-in-Law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">“I really mean it mama”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">“If he [the Husband] never come back tonight.

According to her, such feelings arose because (1) the Husband had installed a video recorder in the helper’s room, and (2) he had not returned home for some time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       I am unable to accept the Wife’s claim. According to her, she had sent the above messages so that the Brother-in-Law could question the Husband and solve her marital issues.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In other words, she had an ulterior motive for sending the messages. During cross-examination, the Wife reluctantly agreed that regardless of the personal issues a parent was facing, the parent should not make threats with a child’s life to get what he/she wanted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     At this juncture, I digress to highlight the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The present case is <em>not</em> one involving a threat (i) made in the heat of the moment under extreme emotional circumstances, or (ii) linked to an underlying psychiatric condition. In such cases, the facts may show that the maker of the threat did not intend to cause harm: <em>TDN v TDM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16446-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 143</a> at [26].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Depending on the facts, a PPO may still be an appropriate option to deter the respondent from making similar threats in future even if the respondent is mentally unstable: see e.g., <em>UMP v UMQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21906-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 57</a> at [23] and [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Husband is facing charges</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63      <em>Third</em>, the Wife had also submitted that a PPO is unnecessary to protect the Husband. The basis for this submission is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_a\"></a>(a)     After the trial had ended, the Wife complained to the Police that the Husband had (on 14 May 2025) breached an expedited order (“<b>EO</b>”) issued against him. Specifically, he had allegedly used his elbow to press onto the back of her neck area and thus caused her pain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 23 April 2025, the Husband was charged in court for (i) breaching the EO, an offence under s 63C of the Charter, and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt, an offence under s 323 read with s 74C of the Penal Code 1871.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Arising from the above, the Wife made two submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, that I should draw the appropriate “inference” from the fact that the Police and Attorney General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”) had seen it fit to press charges against the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, that the Husband is a “violent person ... and therefore cannot be said to require a personal protection order for himself”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I am unable to agree with the Wife’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s criminal case has not concluded at the time of this judgement. The fact that he is facing prosecution does not prove that he had committed the acts alleged in his charges. At the risk of stating the obvious, he is innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any event, whether the Husband is a “violent person” or not is irrelevant to the issue of whether <em>the Wife</em> should be deterred from committing family violence against him via a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In my view, a PPO is necessary. During the trial, it is clear to me that the parties have an acrimonious relationship. The risk of the Wife committing further violence against the Husband is heightened by the fact that they are undergoing divorce. It is likely that they will have conflicts regarding how the marriage is to be dissolved and on matters relating to the children – given their very different parenting styles and attitudes towards the use of corporal punishment: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Wife had moved out of the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66      <em>Finally</em>, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I am not persuaded by this submission. The fact that the parties are no longer residing together does not mean that family violence in the future is unlikely. In the present case, I note that the Wife appears to have a controlling personality and to tend to make inflammatory remarks towards the Husband <em>over WhatsApp</em>. This is evident, for instance, in the WhatsApp exchanges between the parties on 28 July 2023. The background to this exchange has already been set out in [5] to [16] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> To recap –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband told the Wife that her punishment of the son was unduly harsh – considering that it was just spelling. He had requested the Wife not to “overreact”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite the fact that the tone in the Husband’s messages was measured, the Wife responded with a barrage of accusatory statements. This included (i) asserting that the son’s poor performance was “definitely” due to the Husband’s “mistakes” (Message at 10.59 am), (ii) telling him “Don’t be stupid” (Message at 11.11 am), (iii) calling him an “irresponsible father who focus on money alone” (Message at 11.12 am), and (iv) scolding him, “shame on you” (Message at 11.15 am).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Another example of the Wife’s tendency to be controlling and to make inflammatory statements can be seen in the WhatsApp exchange between the parties on 2 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     At about 2.17 pm on that day, the Wife declared her decision to get a divorce. At about 2.25 pm, she sent several messages with <em>exaggerated claims</em> against the Husband – e.g., claiming that he might “record naked videos of me or our daughter for money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Within a minute after sending the above messages, the Wife asked the Husband to settle her “phone contract” issue. The way that she had engaged with him on this issue is very revealing about the <em>power dynamics</em> between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       When the Husband replied that he was at a meeting and that he was not free that day, the Wife insisted that the “phone contract” matter must be settled that day. Despite the Husband suggesting that she could check first with the Woodlands and Yishun branches of the service provider and that he would be free to be with her from 7.40 pm, the Wife replied “nope”, “somerset”, “Don’t instruct me to do that and this”, “you have to do – I can pay yr last 2 hours salary”, “need to get this settled”. (Messages from 3.40 pm to 3.41 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When the Husband highlighted that the “phone contract” matter was not urgent and that he would make the payment on 2 April itself, the Wife made clear that her demands were non-negotiable, stating that, “im not free”, “need to settle it”, “im planning to move out this weekends (sic)”, “U don’t decide behalf of me whether there is urgency or not”. (Messages from 4.35 pm to 4.39 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       When the Husband sought to negotiate with the Wife the time and place to meet her to settle the “phone contract” (by asking the Wife to meet him at Somerset at 7.20 pm), she demanded, “u fetch me at 5.30 pm”, “at woodlands”. (Message at 4.45 pm) At this juncture, I digress to highlight that the Wife had set the meeting time at 5.30 pm despite the Husband having told her that he would be free only after 7.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Wife had also chided the Husband thereafter by texting, “Don’t behave like an idiot, can? You are very free to do all the recording and nonsense things”. (Message at 5.31 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     To sum-up, the Wife’s tendency to be controlling and to make inflammatory statements towards the Husband over WhatsApp increases the likelihood of family violence being committed against him in future. In the circumstances, a PPO can remind her to avoid conduct that can constitute continual harassment against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For the above reasons, I grant the Husband’s PPO application for the children and himself. Additionally, I order the parties to undergo mandatory counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Before concluding, I wish to address one point raised in the Husband’s closing submissions. To protect the children, the Husband had requested that (a) a domestic exclusion order be issued and (b) the matter be referred to the Child Protection Specialist Centre (“<b>CPSC</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> I do not see the need to accede to these requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband has failed to prove that the nature of the family violence committed by the Wife is so severe that it is necessary to take the draconian step of excluding her from the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if the Husband thinks that it is appropriate to refer the matter to the CPSC, he is at liberty to do so himself.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Complainant’s Written Submissions dated 03.05.25 at [1] to [17]; Husband’s statement dated 01.07.24 (C1) at page 4; Record of Proceedings for 03.10.24 at page 87 (line 1) to page 92 (line 27).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Respondent’s Skeletal Closing Submissions dated 27.02.25 at [30] and [32]; Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at [30] and [31].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The attendance table is in the Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at page 100.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 20.12.24 at page 52 (line 17 to line 29).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>The medical report is at the Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at page 104.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>The Husband applied for PPO on 15.05.24.

After filing their respective papers, parties appeared for the substantive hearing on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Before commencing the trial, the Court saw parties in chambers to finalise, among other things, certain housekeeping matters. At that session, both the wife’s counsel, Mr Segeram, and the husband were present. However, as elaborated below, just before the Court was about to commence with the hearing, the husband made the considered decision <em>not to participate</em> further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Notwithstanding the defendant’s deliberate decision not to participate, the trial proceeded. On that basis, after hearing from the wife and her witness, the Court granted the wife’s application and granted interim judgment (<em>vide</em> FC/IJ 500/2025, or “IJ”) to dissolve the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Despite <em>choosing not to participate</em> in the trial, the husband has filed the present appeal against this Court granting IJ in the wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties were married in India, whereby the marriage was solemnised in October 2006, and subsequently registered in December 2007. Parties were originally from India, and the wife moved to Singapore after the marriage to be with the husband as he was already working in Singapore since 2005.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are two children to the marriage, both girls. The elder daughter (“C1”) was born in November 2009, and the younger daughter (“C2”) was born in November 2012.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Commencement of D 4670</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I now set out the procedural history of the divorce proceedings leading up to the hearing on 3 February 2025. As noted above, the eventual hearing was uneventful in light of the husband’s decision not to participate in the trial. However, although not directly relevant to the present appeal, I found it apposite to set out some various aspects of the procedural history which, in my view, shed light and insight on the husband’s conduct during the entire course of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Following from the breakdown of their relationship, the wife commenced D 4670 in October 2022. In her papers, she sought for an order for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground ‘unreasonable behaviour’ under the then section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It suffices to summarise at this juncture that the wife asserted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the husband was abusive to her after the birth of C2,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> had committed family violence against her (including punching her in the face),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and was having an improper association.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Contemporaneously, in September 2022, the wife commenced FC/OSG 96/2022 (“OSG 96”) seeking orders in respect of the Children. The husband was represented in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Whilst the husband was represented in OSG 96, the wife had issues with serving the papers in D 4670 on the husband. Issues arose in part because the husband’s solicitors in OSG 96 had indicated that they had no instructions to accept service of the papers in D 4670 on the husband’s behalf. As such, the wife sought an order for substituted service of the divorce papers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 11 November 2022, the Court granted the wife’s application for substituted service. On 21 November 2022, the divorce documents in D 4670 were served on the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was only <em>after</em> the wife was able to serve the divorce documents in D 4670 on the husband (by way of substituted service) that the husband filed a notice stating that he had appointed solicitors for D 4670. A review of the court records will show that the solicitors who were appointed for D 4670 were, in fact, <em>the same solicitors</em> representing him for OSG 96.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the issues with service, it bears noting that on 12 December 2022, the wife filed a ‘Request for Setting Down Action for Trial’ for the divorce to proceed on an uncontested basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Separately, in light of OSG 96, the father himself separately commenced OSG 6/2023 (“OSG 6”) on 5 January 2023, seeking orders for custody and care and control of the Children, as well as maintenance for the Children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> stay proceedings (SUM 21/2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Two days before commencing OSG 6, on 3 January 2023, the husband commenced Summons No. 21/2023 (“SUM 21”) to stay D 4670 on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In this regard, the husband had, <em>after</em> the wife commenced D 4670 and OSG 96, commenced his own set of divorce proceedings in India on 29 October 2022 (i.e, Original Petition No. 1318, or “OP 1318”). OP 1318 was commenced in the husband’s home state of Palakkad, India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     SUM 21 was initially fixed for hearing in March 2023. As noted earlier, at this time, both the wife and husband were represented in D 4670. At that hearing, it was noted that instead of filing an expert affidavit on foreign law, the husband simply included a letter from an Indian lawyer seeking to comment on aspects of foreign law. Given that the issue of Indian law (as a matter of foreign law) was an essential issue to the determination of SUM 21, directions were given for parties to properly regularise the admission of foreign law expert evidence as part of SUM 21, with a further hearing fixed in May 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At this juncture, it is worth noting that one of the central planks of the husband’s argument in support of a stay in D 4670 was his claim of the interplay between Singapore’s and India’s laws relating to divorce. As noted earlier, parties’ marriage was registered in India, and the husband had contended that the grounds/facts for divorce in Singapore are dissimilar to those in India, such that any Singapore divorce order <em>may</em> not be recognised in India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> That said, the husband also wants to have the divorce heard in India because of his claim that the wife had committed adultery, and assuming that that fact is established, husband has an apparent right to seek damages against the wife and/or the third party involved. Put another way, it cannot be completely discounted that the husband’s desire for the divorce proceedings to take place in India was strategic or tactical in nature. This is because the ‘fact’ of adultery as a basis for dissolving a marriage is also provided for under the WC. In short, the husband would conceivably have gotten the outcome he wanted to in Singapore as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I turn back to the procedural history. In the lead up to the May 2023 hearing, the husband filed his notice indicating that he was now acting in person. In light of this and as parties were still in the midst of negotiating a global settlement in OSG 96, the hearing fixed in May 2023 was vacated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As parties were unable to reach a resolution on the divorce, the hearing for SUM 21 was fixed for 26 June 2023. Then, on 22 June 2023, the husband wrote in requesting that the June 2023 hearing be vacated. Some of the reasons stated in the request included substantive arguments in support of his application in SUM 21. In light of this, the Court declined the husband’s request, and maintained its earlier directions that the hearing on 26 June 2023 proceed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the day of the hearing on 26 June 2023, the husband wrote in seeking for the hearing to be adjourned on the basis that the C2 was unwell. Notwithstanding the timing of the husband’s correspondence, I found it appropriate to acknowledge Mr Segeram’s amenability not to proceed in the husband’s absence, in part because parties were still attempting to resolve the matter globally. As such, permission was given to refix the hearing to 24 July 2023. That said, in light of the filing of parties’ respect expert evidence, the Court highlighted the completeness of parties’ documents to be used for the hearing of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On 7 July 2023, the husband filed his notice appointing solicitors for the matter. In light of solicitors coming on board, the husband made another request to adjourn the 24 July 2023 to a later date. Needless to say, the wife objected to the husband’s request to refix the matter again. That said, after hearing parties, on 17 July 2023, the Court was inclined to allow one final adjournment of the hearing. After considering parties’ available dates in their subsequent correspondence, the hearing for SUM 21 was fixed for 4 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     At the hearing on 4 September 2023, the Court heard substantive arguments from parties. After the hearing, the Court issued further directions for parties to provide supplemental submissions on a number of areas. This includes supplemental submissions on certain developments which had taken place after this Court had released its decision on <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> (which dealt with, among other things, the interplay between our local laws relating to divorce and the law applying to parties at the time of marriage in the context of a stay application for <em>forum non conveniens</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Events after conclusion of SUM 21</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     After receiving parties’ supplemental submissions and after considering parties’ arguments, this Court dismissed SUM 21 on 26 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s submission of further arguments</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     After the Court released its decision for SUM 21, the husband sought to make further arguments on the matter, which included the wife’s purported submissions to the Indian courts <em>after</em> the Court’s decision in SUM 21. Whilst I was inclined for the husband to make these further arguments, I had specifically indicated to parties’ that in light of the dismissal of SUM 21, parties were to file their remaining pleadings for the divorce. At the time SUM 21 was dismissed, the husband had not yet filed his Defence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I pause here and note, through no fault of the husband’s solicitors, the husband’s decision to delay/refusal the filing of his pleadings after the decision in SUM 21. Despite issuing numerous directions for the filing of pleadings, the husband <em>consistently</em> chose not to file anything. This is in part because of his belief that any filing would prejudice his position in the Indian divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On 20 June 2024, after receiving parties’ submissions relating to the husband’s further arguments, the Court maintained its decision to dismiss SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s continued failure to file his pleadings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Further to the Court’s decision, parties’ solicitors appeared before the Court for a case conference of D 4670 on 10 July 2024. At that case conference, the Court noted that the husband had still not filed his pleadings. The husband’s solicitor then, Mr Koh, apprised the Court that after speaking to his Indian solicitors, the husband was advised not to comply with this Court’s directions. This is after the Court had highlighted to Mr Koh the need for parties to file their pleadings. Two important inferences arise from Mr Koh’s submissions – the first is that the husband was aware of the direction to file his pleadings, and the importance of the same. The second is that with that knowledge, and in consultation with the advice of his Indian solicitors, the husband <em>chose</em> not to file his pleadings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In light of the husband’s position, I formally determined that pleadings had closed, leaving the wife’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”) and Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) as the only pleadings for the divorce. Further to this, I issued the relevant directions for parties to file their respective Affidavit-of-Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), the set down date for trial, and the filing of opening statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The hearing of D 4670 was scheduled to take place on 12 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s filing of SUM 2526</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On 6 August 2024, the husband filed a notice for a change of solicitors. On 8 August 2024 (ie, the last business day before the Monday of the hearing on 12 August 2024 (in light of the National Day public holiday)), the husband filed Summons No. 2526/2024 (“SUM 2526”). SUM 2526 was the husband’s application for a stay pending (1) the outcome of HCF/OSN 6//2024 (“OSN 6”), and/or (2) the outcome of the husband’s appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21 (in the event OSN 6 was granted). For context, OSN 6 was the husband’s application for an extension of time to file his appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As the husband had filed SUM 2526 on the last working day before the hearing of D 4670, Mr Segeram was not in a position to deal with the application. Since SUM 2526 had to be addressed first (as it was an application to stay the proceedings pending the High Court’s determination in OSN 6), the Court was constrained to vacate the hearing of the divorce, and gave directions for the relevant responses to SUM 2526.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Dismissal of OSN 6, discharge of husband’s solicitor, and husband’s further attempt to resolve the divorce</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 19 September 2024, the High Court dismissed OSN 6. This meant that the husband no longer could appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In other words, D 4670 would proceed in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Further to the dismissal of OSN 6, Parties attended before the Court on 20 September 2024 to receive the necessary directions to proceed with D 4670. On the same day, the husband filed another notice, this time indicating that he was acting in person, again. Indeed, at the case conference, the husband’s solicitor sought leave to be discharged. I granted leave for the solicitor to be discharged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In light of the dismissal of SUM 21 and OSN 6, the husband sought for more time to further attempt to resolve the divorce globally with the wife. The husband even sought for a further mediation, which I was not inclined to accede to. Instead, I granted the husband time to correspond with Mr Segeram for a final attempt at agreeing on the terms of the <em>existing</em> pleadings. In light of the fact that the husband was now self-representing himself, and perhaps naïvely hopeful, I granted the husband a fairly lengthy period of time for him to be able to find a middle ground with the wife. This is especially given my observations at paragraph 18 above that the husband’s primary complaint would be the wife’s infidelity, and if parties were to come to some consensus (at least on the specific fact of divorce), parties would have been able to better divert their resources to the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     However, after receiving updates from parties, parties were not able to reach a comprise. As such, a further case conference was convened on 10 January 2025. At that case conference, the husband sought to rehash the arguments substantively canvassed in SUM 21 as to the purported appropriateness of the divorce proceedings taking place in India. When presented with the reality that the Court was not minded to accede to any such arguments, the husband then shifted tact to say that he wished to file his defence and counterclaim. However, the Court had explained to the husband his specific position at the material time that he <em>did not</em> wish to comply with the Court’s directions relating to the filing of his pleadings. It is at this juncture where the husband asserted that his available options was not made known to him by his previous solicitors upon the dismissal of SUM 21. However, I was not minded to accept the husband’s reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In light of the previous directions given for the close of pleadings, I directed that parties file and serve their AEICs by 27 January 2025, with the hearing of the divorce to take place on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> stay proceedings (SUM 220/2025) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Leading up to the hearing on 3 February 2025, the husband filed several notices of his intention to refer to the affidavits filed in OSG 96, OSG 6, as well as affidavits which appear to have been filed in the State Courts pursuant to an application made under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     That said, the husband had yet to file his AEICs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Instead, the husband only filed, <em>on the day</em> of the hearing, the following AEICs:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His AEIC;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The AEIC of ‘SB’;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The AEIC of ‘BC’; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The AEIC of ‘FAR’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Additionally, on 31 January 2025 (the Friday before the hearing on Monday), the husband filed <em>another</em> application for a stay of proceedings in favour of the divorce proceedings in India. This application was made under Summons No. 220/2025 (“SUM 220”). Given the time in which the husband filed SUM 220, that matter was fixed for a case conference together with the hearing of D 4670 on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Hearing on 3 February 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As noted earlier, before the start of the hearing for D 4670 on 3 February 2025, Mr Segeram and the husband attended before the Court in chambers for a pre-hearing conference for final housekeeping matters (particularly in light of the late filing of the husband’s AEICs), as well as to address the Court on SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     With regard to SUM 220, the husband sought to highlight to this Court that there have been some developments with the various proceedings that are going on in India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> For instance, his own divorce proceeding in OP 1318 was to be transferred from his home state in Palakkad to the wife’s home state of Kozhikode. While that in and of itself is not controversial, the point which the husband wished to make was there these proceedings happened to be going on concurrently with D 4670. In this connection and additionally, the husband highlighted that he had filed an anti-suit injunction (<em>vide</em> Originating Petition 660, or “OP 660”) to restrain parties from continuing with D 4670. For completeness, the husband had also filed an interlocutory application within OP 660 seeking for the matter to be expedited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In short, the husband contended that proceedings in India seem to be going along its own way <em>in spite of</em> this Court’s decision in SUM 21. The upshot of this is that it indicates an indecisiveness on the wife’s part, and effectively amounts to her having her cake and eating it. In those circumstances, the present proceedings in D 4670 should be stayed in favour of the proceedings in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Not surprisingly, the wife disagreed with the husband’s contentions. As regards the transfer of OP 1318, Mr Segeram acknowledged the transfer order of the proceedings to Kozhikode. However, Mr Segeram mentioned that because this order was merely in furtherance of TRP 418, and nothing substantive has been done, it is speculative as to what might happen in those proceedings, if at all. Separately, in terms of the stage of those proceedings, the proceedings in D 4670 were well ahead of any of the other proceedings in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Separately, as regards OP 660, Mr Segeram brought to my attention that the Indian courts have actually conclusively dealt with the matter, and dismissed the husband’s application. In a copy of the Indian court’s decision dated 24 December 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, the Indian court made the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">On going through the entire records, I am of the considered view that the [husband] has approached this court without clean hands. So, considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, I am not inclined to grant any kind of injunction order against the [wife].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the result, the petition [(ie., OP 660)] is dismissed without costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The husband contends that this is not a conclusive order, because in his affidavit in support of SUM 220, there appears to be a further court date fixed for OP 660 on 1 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     After hearing parties, whilst I was not inclined to make a specific ruling on SUM 220 on the same day (in part because the wife has had no opportunity to properly respond to the application given the late filing by the husband), I was also not inclined to delay the hearing of D 4670 further. In this regard:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     D 4670 was commenced by the October 2022. A significant amount of time had passed, with parties not finding any meaningful resolution to the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     At each turn, the husband had sought to prevent and/or delay the proper progress of D 4670. This includes the filing of OP 1318, the filing of SUM 21, OSN 6, and more recently the belated filing of SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When SUM 21 was fully disposed of following the dismissal of OSN 6, the husband sought to buy himself more time by making a final attempt at seeing if the matter can be resolved. However, it would seem that the only resolution which the husband was seeking was for the wife to stop D 4670, and to have the matter litigated in India on his grievance of adultery. Put another way, the husband’s intention to resolve the matter was on the basis that it be resolved <em>on his terms only</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     When it was clear that D 4670 was going to proceed, the husband chose to only file his AEICs <em>on the day of the trial</em>. In addition, and perhaps trying to get another bite of the cherry, the husband filed SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In filing SUM 220, the husband sought to make tangential and piecemeal points on the progress of the Indian proceedings. However, despite the effluxion of time, the husband readily acknowledges that further to the dismissal of SUM 21, there was no existing court order preventing this Court from proceeding with D 4670. On the contrary, as noted above, there is, at present, an express order made by the Indian court <em>denying</em> the husband any injunction against the wife. While the husband highlighted that he was intending to appeal against that decision, it does not change the fact there is no order preventing this Court from proceeding with D 4670.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Insofar as the husband wishes to assert that he would be prejudiced with D 4670 proceeding (at least in light of him commencing SUM 220), I was not inclined to agree. As noted above, OP 1318 was commenced <em>after</em> D4670. In terms of relief (ie adultery), such recourse was available to him D 4670 (had he filed his pleadings). There is nothing which he wishes to do in India which he cannot substantively achieve in Singapore. Separate from all this, the husband has fully participated in OSG 96 in Singapore. There is nothing to be gained in India other than pecuniary relief in connection with this contention of adultery. Even then, I had provisionally indicated (in the absence of anything to the contrary) in my decision in SUM 21 that such relief appears to be a separate and distinct relief which would not be extinguished <em>even if</em> there was a divorce order in Singapore dissolving the marriage on the grounds of adultery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The real prejudice, if anything, to my mind, is the husband’s predilection to have the divorce concluded <em>on his terms only</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It is at this point, when faced the reality that his attempts to hold off D 4670 have come to an end, the husband did what he had done previously – simply refused to participate. Whilst he had every opportunity to participate in the hearing, just before it was about to start, the husband stated the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Husband]:    I don’t want to be in the trial. Your Honour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, whilst indicating an intention not to participate in the trial, the husband attempted to raise an issue regarding the scheduling of when his witnesses were to file their AEICs. In this regard, the husband had written to Court by way of an email dated 27 January 2025 seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, the schedule on when his witnesses can testify, and whether they are able to give evidence remotely. For completeness, stated below is an extract of the husband’s correspondence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    I would like to seek the Court’s directions and confirmation on the below –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a)    The schedule of when they can testify and whether some of them can do so by video conference via zoom or whether they must be physically present at the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b)    The schedule of <b>by when they can file their AEIC’s</b> [sic]. I intend to file scanned copy of notarised AEICs of the witnesses on their behalf at the Crimson Logic Service Bureau, but getting the original hard copies couriered to Singapore might incur time very likely beyond 31 January 2025 [the extended deadline given by the Court following the husband’s request on 20 January 2025]. Ideally, the witnesses are asking for and will appreciate some more time to file their AEICs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I found it apposite to make a few points regarding this request (which came in one week before the hearing on 3 February 2025):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     By way of the Court’s directions on 10 January 2025 and 20 January 2025, it was clear that the deadline for parties to file and serve their AEICs was 31 January 2025. For the husband to write in seeking ‘confirmation’ of the Court’s clear directions, if anything, seeks to introduce, in my judgment, a self-created ambiguity which may be utilised by the husband for his own purposes. Indeed, at the hearing on 3 February 2025, when it was clear that the Court was not minded to adjourn the hearing any further, the husband sought to raise the issue. Separately, it is also noted that in the same request, the husband was essentially seeking leave, without any application (as provided for in the practice directions) for his intended witnesses to give evidence remotely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The underlying tenor of the husband’s correspondence, as with many of his correspondence, is prefaced with either a query or difficulty in complying with the Court’s directions. This either forms a caveat or justification for subsequently not complying with the Court’s directions. Moreover, when queried about his action (or inaction as the case may be), the husband is ever ready with a response to defend/explain his conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Put simply, the husband was creating every conceivable opportunity to conduct the proceedings <em>on his own terms</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     As I was not inclined to accede to his ultimate request for the hearing of D 4670 not to proceed (be it <em>via</em> a stay or some or procedural matter relating to his witnesses), I stood the matter down for parties to prepare themselves for the hearing to start. I also provided the time for the husband to consider his position on participating in the hearing. As I noted earlier, the husband had every opportunity to participate in the proceedings, <em>if he wished to</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     After returning from the break, the husband confirmed his choice of not participating in the trial.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> On that basis, the trial proceeded in the husband’s <em>considered and deliberate</em> absence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Documents forming part of the proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     For ease of reference, the documents forming part of these proceedings are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.78%\"><col width=\"43.78%\"><col width=\"47.44%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Documents filed by Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Documents filed by Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Pleadings</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Statement of Claim dated 6 October 2022 (“SOC”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">SOP</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Affidavits</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife’s AEIC dated 29 July 2024 (“WA1”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband’s AEIC dated 31 January 2025 (“HA”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Opening Statement dated 7 August 2024 (“WOS”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘SB’ dated 28 January 2025 (“SB”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife’s AEIC dated 31 January 2025 (“WA2”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘BC’ dated 2 February 2024 (“BC”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of DD5 (“DD5”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘FAR’ dated 30 January 2025 (“FAR”)</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Separately, part of the record of proceedings include the hearing transcript of the hearing on 3 February 2025 (ie, the NE).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ pleaded positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As briefly stated at paragraph 9 above, the wife’s pleaded position in support of her application is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife had come across a suspicious text message which stated “Sorry, please don’t tell your husband”.

By doing so, neither he nor his witnesses were present for the evidence to be examined. It is appropriate to pause here and note rules 589 and 590(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>General rule: Witnesses to be examined</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">589.  Subject to these Rules and the Evidence Act (Cap. 97), and any other written law relating to evidence, any fact required to be proved at the trial of any action begun by writ by the evidence of witnesses must be proved by the examination of the witnesses in Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Evidence by affidavit</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">590.— (1)    Without prejudice to the generality of rule 589, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    evidence-in-chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    such a witness must attend trial for cross-examination; and (ii) in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The aforementioned provisions are clear that in a trial of a matter commenced by writ (as is the case for D 4670), in light of the husband’s and his witnesses’ non-participation at the hearing, their evidence, <em>as a default position</em>, “shall not” be received in evidence. The provision effectively mandates the removal of such evidence as part of the proceedings for D 4670.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     That said, rule 590 provides that such evidence shall not be received except with the Court’s leave. In the present case, the husband had queried whether, if he were not to participate, whether the AEICs he had filed would be considered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Court had clarified that the AEICs were already filed in the court its system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     After considering the matter, and whilst the husband, strictly speaking, did not make a specific application for leave for his AEICs to be included notwithstanding his or his witnesses’ participation, I was not inclined to strike the evidence out completely. That said, I was not inclined to give it significant weight, and to be taken as bare contentions without the benefit of any form of examination either by the Court (or Mr Segeram through cross-examination). I was not inclined to wipe the husband’s evidence out completely because to do so would mean that he would have absolutely <em>no materials</em> in these proceedings. My decision to have his documents included was to ensure some integrity and completeness of the proceedings as a whole, <em>in spite of</em> the husband’s conduct. To be clear, there was nothing preventing this Court, as expressly provided for in the provisions of the Family Justice Rules stated above, from disregarding the husband’s evidence <em>entirely</em>. My decision to allow his documents to remain on record had less to do with affording the husband some form of deference, but rather, to give some completeness to the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     With those observations, I briefly set out parties’ evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">WA2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The wife’s evidence in her AEIC is broadly an amplification of the matters raised in the SOP. That said, I note the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In respect of the incident of family violence which the wife says was committed by the husband on 9 November 2021 (ie, where he had punched her in the face), the wife included documents and pictures of when she received medical attention on the injuries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Similarly, in respect of the incident of family violence in June 2022, the wife included documents and pictures of the injuries she sustained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As regards the allegation of improper association,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> the wife enclosed the report by the private investigator who had conducted surveillance on the husband. In this connection, it was identified that the person who the husband was allegedly having and improper association with was SB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">YKK</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     YKK is the private investigator who signed off on the surveillance report which was adduced in these proceedings. A copy of the surveillance report was enclosed in both the wife’s and his AEIC. The period of surveillance was for 5 days in July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     At this juncture, it suffices to reproduce the conclusions made in the report:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">61    The Company had conducted 5 operations on this case with the view to verify the suspicions that the Client had on Subject-1. During these operations, the Company’s surveillance teams were able to observe that Subject-1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> had been visiting Subject-2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> at the [XXX] Condominium, No 16 [XXX] frequently and used to stay there for long period of time. As members of the surveillance team were unable to see the interior of the said unit and observe Subject-1 and Subject-2 inside, the Company cannot conclude that they were involved in any intimacy whilst alone in the apartment. Nevertheless, from the observations carried out by members of the Company’s surveillance teams, there are reasonable inferences to suggest that Subject-1 being a married man had been secretly associating with Subject-2 without his wife knowledge was truly [sic] improper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">62    Observations by members of the Company’s surveillance teams revealed that Subject-1 was able to drive his car to the basement carpark of the [XXX] Condominium through the resident’s lane at the security checkpoint of the condominium indicates that he could frequent the place day or night without hinderance. This showed that either he has rented the unit No 16-26 for Subject-2 to reside to convenient him to see her as and when he wishes or Subject-2 had rented the place so that Subject-1 could visit her in privacy. In either way, it is unethical for Subject-1 being a married man to behave in this manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">HA</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I turn now to the AEICs filed by the husband, and start with this evidence. In this AEIC, the husband made, among others, the following contentions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The husband rehashed the state of the Indian proceedings, and sought to justify how he is not participating in the Singapore proceedings by not filing this pleadings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     How the wife had excluded the period of 2012 to 2019 from her SOP, where there were acts of “infidelity, cruelty, and harassment” towards the husband. The husband sought to adduced of how the wife had admitted to hurting him emotionally.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife’s apparent confession, in the papers for OSG 96, or her improper association with the husband’s brother-in-law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The husband also contended that the wife had anger issues and alcohol addiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He took issue with the text message she had apparently discovered in 2009.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e\"></a>(e)     As regards the incident of family violence in November 2021, the husband allege that it was the wife who had committed violence against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_f\"></a>(f)     As regards the improper association, needless to say, the husband denied this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> His explanation was that SB was a friend who had supported him through his trauma when he learnt about the wife’s acts of adultery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">SB</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The crux of her evidence was to highlight the long-standing friendship between herself and the husband and wife. She shared how, in 2022, when she herself was going through marital problems, how the husband supported her in establishing a new life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In response to the surveillance report, her position was the photos contained therein “are very normal photos of good friends shopping and eating together”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> That having said, she <em>does not</em> deal with specific photos where both she and the husband had their arms on each other’s waist, and the frequency of his visits to her home during the period of surveillance. These were all matters which may have provided some context and/or explanation had the husband and his witnesses participated in the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">BC</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     BC is related to the wife and husband through his maternal and paternal families respectively. BC’s evidence was general in nature, stating his relationship with parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> the husband’s character,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> the wife’s affair,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> how that impacted the husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>, and recent development between parties (which include the husband attempt to resolve the divorce)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. It is noted that BCs’ evidence does not go towards the specific matters raised in the wife’s pleadings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">FAR</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     FAR is the husband’s friend from university, and has known the husband since September 1999. Similar to BC, his evidence comprises principally of broad and tangential points, dealing more with the husband’s leadership and academic capabilities, the husband’s bond with the Children, the wife’s affair and how it affected him. He does however spoke of the time the husband had visited FAR in November 2021, contemporaneous to the incident of family violence highlighted by the wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis and Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Against the backdrop of the foregoing, I now provide my analysis and findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable legal principles in establishing the fact of ‘unreasonable behaviour’</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I start with applicable legal principles. For the purposes of the present proceedings, the legislative architecture governing the Court’s power to order a dissolution of a marriage on the fact of ‘unreasonable behaviour’ may be found in the then sections 95(1), (2), and (3)(b) WC, which provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Irretrievable breakdown of marriage to be sole ground for divorce</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">95.—(1)    Either party to a marriage may file a writ for divorce on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court hearing such proceedings must, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The court hearing any proceedings for divorce is not to hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The oft-cited decision setting out the applicable tests to be satisfied in order to establish the fact of unreasonable behaviour is the High Court decision of <em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a>, where the court held (at [8]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether the respondent’s behaviour has been such that the petitioner can no longer reasonably be expected to live with him is essentially a finding of fact and the courts have avoided categorising conduct as guilty or blameless in the abstract. The question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively: whether his attitude is reasonable is irrelevant. In dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the court, and not the petitioner, to answer it. The test becomes objective but it is not the same as asking whether a hypothetical reasonable spouse in the petitioner’s position would continue to live with the respondent. The court must have regard to the personalities of individuals before it, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm, and it must assess the impact of the respondent’s conduct and the particular petitioner in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As can seen from the above, in order to satisfy the legislative threshold envisaged in section 95(3)(b), it involves both a subjective and objective assessment. It is subjective insofar as to whether the applicant (in this case the wife) subjectively finds it intolerable to live with the respondent (in this case the husband). It is objective insofar as the Court is tasked to ascertain whether an applicant, with his or her personal characteristic and idiosyncrasies, and having regarding to the history of the marriage as a whole, can be reasonably expected to live with the respondent, with his or her own characteristic and idiosyncrasies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I pause here and note that the foregoing deals with assessing the thresholds vis-à-vis a finding that the complained conducted took place (either by assessment of the Court or by admission or consent). It necessarily requires the Court to first undertake an examination on the existence (and so its extent) of the complained conduct or ‘unreasonable behaviour’. As to what constitutes ‘unreasonable behaviour’, I found it apposite to highlight the very recent comments made by Prof. Leong Wai Kum in <em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em> (Leong Wai Kum, 2025, Academy Publishing) (“<em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em>”) at [8.167 <em>et seq</em>]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.167 The High Court in 2009 in <em>Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline</em> clarified that it has unfortunately become common to abbreviate this fact to “unreasonable behaviour”, this is a misnomer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.168 The provision <b>does not require the applicant to prove that the respondent’s behaviour is objectively unreasonable. It suffices if the applicant proves some behaviour of the respondent that renders the expectation of the applicant to continue marital cohabitation with the respondent to be unreasonable</b>. The Family Justice Courts have to assess the personalities of the parties to find that, as a result of the respondent’s behaviour, it is not unreasonable to expect the applicant to continue marital cohabitation with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.169 Having said that, however, it is not a problem if the applicant manages to persuade the Family Justice Courts to find the respondent’s behaviour as objectively unreasonable. This will only aid the applicant in convincing the court that it is therefore unreasonable to expect her to continue marital cohabitation with such a spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.170  <b>It is not necessary to find moral culpability on the part of the respondent. Even if the behaviour complained of by the applicant were something for which the respondent cannot be held morally culpable for, it should be available for use</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The state of parties’ evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     It is against that backdrop where I revisit my earlier observations regarding the state of the husband’s evidence (see paragraphs 60 to 63 above). In light of the husband’s conscious decision not to participate in these proceedings, the default position is that the husband’s and his witnesses’ affidavits are not to be received as part of the evidence of these proceedings. Be that as it may, as explained earlier, I was not inclined to reject the husband’s evidence completely, but accorded it nominal weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     By that same token, in light of the husband’s absence and his failure to avail himself of the right to cross examine the wife’s and YKK’s evidence, their evidence, in my view, is <em>prima facie</em> unchallenged. That said, and whilst not doing the husband’s job for him, I will address certain parts of the evidence adduced by the husband and the witnesses, to see whether the affidavit evidence, in itself, is able to overcome the wife’s unchallenged evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Assessment of the husband’s conduct</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s ‘general’ conduct of being verbally and/or physically abusive</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In assessing the materials before me, I note that save for the specific incidents of violence in 2021 and 2022, the wife does not provide any specific particulars in her pleadings of the husband being verbally abusive. That said, I note in her AEIC that the wife makes mention of the husband belittling her in front of the domestic helper and Children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and that he expected her to obey all of his commands without question.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In light of the foregoing, after assessing the materials before me and notwithstanding the nominal nature of the husband’s evidence, I was unable to make a definitive finding on whether these claimed events took place. Put another way, on the wife’s own evidence, I was not inclined to find that she had discharged her burden to proving the facts which she chose to assert.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     That said, and taking the husband’s own evidence of his discovery of the purported adultery by the wife, and the apparent oppression he was living under by the wife, it was not lost on this Court that minimally, such dissatisfaction would have influenced (or even dictated) how he conducted himself with the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident of violence in November 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I turn next to the incident of violence on 9 November 2021 where the husband had struck the wife’s face and nose. In her evidence, she adduces the discharge summary of her visit to Parkway East Hospital on 10 November 2021, as well as the photographs she had apparently taken after the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Unlike the earlier general averment of violence, I was satisfied that the wife had, on the materials before it, <em>prima facie</em> discharged her burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that something happened to her. Since the husband was not present to examine the wife, these facts are not substantively challenged. That said, and for completeness, I note the husband’s evidence that it was his view that it was the wife who was violent to him that day. His assertion was that it was the wife who had kicked him, causing him to apparently suffer another heart attack.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     After assessing parties’ evidence and materials, what is common ground is that parties were discussing the topic of divorce. The discussion got heated, and on each party’s evidence, they mentioned that it was the other person who committed violence on them first. Even if I were to accept the husband’s evidence, it still does not explain away the contemporaneous documents submitted by the wife. None of the husband’s evidence, on its face, is a complete answer towards the wife’s own documents in her AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     For those reasons, and on a balance of probabilities on the basis of the wife’s unchallenged evidence on the matter, I was prepared to accept that parties’ <em>undisputed</em> argument with each other on 9 November 2021 had escalated into something more serious between the two of them. Further to my earlier observations at paragraph 82 above, what can be reasonably inferred is that by then, the husband had all but checked out from the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s late nights when he was unemployed / in between jobs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     At the outset, in her pleadings, the wife just made the averment that the husband would generally return late at night or early in the morning. Subsequently, in her evidence, the wife did not provide any further particulars of the extent of these late nights. The wife also did not provide any particulars of her belief that the husband was “staying at some other place”. It was also only in her AEIC where she made the supposition that the late nights were connected with the husband’s improper association with SB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     For those reasons, and on the materials before me, I make no specific finding in respect of this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident of family violence in 18 July 2022 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     I turn next to the alleged incident of violence of 18 July 2022, where the wife contended that the husband had, <em>inter alia</em>, ordered the wife to leave the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> There was also an argument surrounding the issue of a divorce, which led to the husband strangling her. In her AEIC, the points raised above are substantively similar, save that the wife highlighted that the argument that day related to the husband’s purported intention to take the Children away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In his AEIC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, the husband’s narrative is that it was the wife who attempted to take the Children’s passport away from him. As such, an argument ensued. In the husband’s <em>own</em> evidence, he acknowledged that the argument then <em>escalated</em> into a scuffle. While he makes mention in his police report asserting that neither party did not sustain injuries, the husband <em>does not</em> address the contemporaneous medical documents found in the wife’s AEIC. Such medical documents include the police medical form.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     After assessing the materials before me, what is undisputed is that there was yet <em>another</em> disagreement between parties on marital issues (this time about the Children). What is also undisputed in both parties’ evidence is that this disagreement <em>escalated</em> into a scuffle. Whilst the husband may deny that he caused the wife injury (which I have my reservations about), the husband does not deny there being a physical escalation between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     This is, to my mind, further evidence on the state of parties’ relationship, and how they were conducting themselves with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s improper association with SB</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I turn to the next the husband’s improper association with SB. Putting aside whether or not there was, in fact, an improper association between the husband and SB, the following facts are not disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the surveillance report, it was clear that the husband was, in my view, spending an immoderate amount of time with SB, going to her home as well as partaking in social activities <em>with just the two of them alone</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the husband’s own evidence, he effectively leaned on to SB as support for his “trauma” after the discovery of the wife’s alleged infidelity. By the same token, in SB’s own evidence, she acknowledges the husband’s presence in supporting her to establish a new life during the “turbulent” period of her own marriage when she was living separately from her partner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     At its very core, as a result of their own respective difficulties and challenges, they found support (and perhaps comfort and solace) from and with each other. The husband found joy in the company of another woman who was not the wife. It may not give rise to legal (or perhaps even moral) culpability, but it does gives an insight on the closeness between them, as evidenced in the surveillance report. Such closeness includes, from the documentary evidence, in the form of holding each other’s waist whilst walking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and their closeness whilst having meals<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. The husband may assert that there is nothing sinister or morally culpable with his behaviour with SB, but as I had observed earlier, his behaviour with SB is a further manifestation of the underlying reality of his perspective of the marriage and how he viewed the wife. To that end, I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the husband’s interactions with a woman who was not the wife was, at best, peculiar, and at worst, improper and unacceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Should the marriage be dissolved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     When taken in its totality, and following the comments made in <em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em> I highlighted above (see paragraph 77 above), I was of the view that the conduct highlighted by the wife would make it unreasonable to expect her to continue marital cohabitation with the husband. In my judgment, for all intents and purposes, and to varying degrees and different points in time, the husband’s behaviour is indicative of someone who has all but given up on the marriage, and wishes to move on with his life. As noted earlier, his resistance is his subjective belief that he wishes to end the marriage only on his terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The wife’s alleged infidelity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     For completeness, and whilst I note that this was not the husband’s pleaded case (because the husband did not file his pleadings), I found it apposite to make some provisional observations regarding the husband’s allegations of the wife’s infidelity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     I had earlier highlighted (see paragraph 39 above) that the husband had filed a notice of intention to refer to, <em>inter alia</em>, the papers filed by the wife in OSG 96. In those papers, the wife does refer to a relationship in 2016 which apparently ended in 2019. At the trial, I asked the wife about this, and she acknowledges that she was “close”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> with the husband’s brother-in-law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     To that end, even if a finding of adultery were to be made (which, for clarity, I do not make), I have my reservations whether the husband would be able to address the limitations set in section 95(5) WC given when the affair took place and subsequently ended. Even if I were to find that the wife had committed adultery, it does not change the fact the husband’s own behaviour rendered it unreasonable for the wife to be expected to continue marital cohabitation with the husband. Put another way, the wife’s alleged adultery, assuming if proved, does not wipe away the husband’s own conduct towards the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     For the above reasons, I granted the wife’s application for the marriage to be dissolved. On the issue of costs, after hearing Mr Segeram, I ordered that the husband pay the wife costs of an incidental to the hearing of D 4670, with such costs fixed at $12,500 (inclusive of disbursements). For completeness, I had also given the usual consequential directions for parties to file the necessary documents in respect of the ancillary matters.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Collectively, the children are referred to as “Children”).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>For completeness, the WC was amended pursuant to the Women’s Charter (Amendment Act) 2022 (the “Amendment Act”).

In February 2025, she applied for <em>additional child maintenance</em> of <em>$840</em> against the Husband: MSS 369/2025 (“<b>MSS 369</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband objected to the Wife’s application on two grounds. <em>First</em>, he “suspected” that the son was not his. <em>Second</em>, he was already paying maintenance pursuant to MO 528 and there was thus no need to pay further maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After hearing the evidence, I decided to order the Husband to pay $650/month for the son’s maintenance. In this judgement, I will provide my reasons for this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">No variation to the daughter’s maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before explaining my reasons, I wish to touch very briefly on the daughter’s maintenance for completeness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In MSS 369, the Wife did not adduce any evidence to show that there had been a material change in the daughter’s circumstances or that the child’s maintenance in MO 528 is inadequate. This is not surprising, given that (a) the daughter is still very young (only about two years old, born in August 2022) and (b) her maintenance was ordered just about six months ago.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Accordingly, in addressing MSS 369, I saw no need to vary my order in MO 528 that the Husband is to <em>pay the Wife</em> $200 for the daughter’s food and groceries: see 2024 Decision at [10] to [17]. This order was made on the basis that the Husband is to <em>himself cover</em> two of the daughter’s expenses (instead of making payment for them to the Wife). These are, <em>first</em>, the costs of the daughter’s diapers (2024 Decision at [18] and [19]), and <em>second</em>, her childcare fees after the funds in her Child Development Account (“<b>CDA</b>”) has been depleted (2024 Decision at [21]). Presently, these fees stand at about $339/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband is liable to maintain the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Thus, for the purpose of MSS 369, I focussed on whether it is appropriate to order the Husband to pay maintenance for the son. I begin with the Husband’s submission that he is not liable to maintain the son because he “suspects” that the child’s father is someone else.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Observations in the 2024 Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is useful to note that the Husband had made a similar submission in MSS 1306. My response to this submission is contained in the following observations in the 2024 Decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    With regards to the Husband’s [submission that he could not be sure that the unborn child is his], the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>First</em>, the Husband does not deny that he had sexual relations with the Wife during the period when the unborn child was conceived, i.e., April 2024. There is no evidence that the Wife had sexual relations with any other man during this time. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the Husband is the unborn child’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>Second</em>, s 114(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 is relevant. It provides that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Where any person <em>was born</em> —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(a)    during the continuance of a valid marriage between his or her mother and any man; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(b)    within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage, the mother remaining unmarried,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-4\">it is <em>presumed</em> that the person is the legitimate child of that man, <em>unless the contrary is proved</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-4\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Section 114(1) presumes that a man is the father of a child if it <em>is born</em> within a prescribed period. Strictly speaking, s 114(1) does not apply in the present case because the child which the Wife is carrying has not been born yet.

According to him, he would spend $200/month for the daughter’s food and snacks. In my view, this amount seems to be excessive – given that (i) the daughter is only about two years old, (ii) the Husband’s take care of her for only half a week, and (iii) the amount of $200/month is in addition to the milk powder that he is paying monthly: see item [30(f)]. Accordingly, I reduced the amount for item [30(e)] from $200 to $100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item [30(j)] – Since March 2025, the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home and has been renting a room of his own. The figure of $450 in item [30(j)] is derived by deducting the costs of renting the room ($1,050: see Exhibit C3) from the rental income that the Husband receives from letting out a room in the home ($1,500).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Item [30(p)] – According to the Husband, he gives $1,200/month as allowance to his parents. The Wife disputes this, claiming that he has in fact been siphoning this amount from the matrimonial assets. I wish to make clear that in factoring item [30(p)] into the computation, I make no finding whether the funds were in fact given to the Husband’s parents. I have included this item purely for the purpose of assessing whether the Husband can afford to pay the son’s maintenance at $650/month – <em>assuming that</em> he pays $1,200/month to his parents. I will leave it to the judge hearing the ancillary matters relating to the parties’ divorce to determine the issue raised by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Item [30(q)] – In his statement filed on 8 April 2025 (Exhibit R1), the Husband stated that he had taken loans from three banks. He however did not state how much he must repay monthly. The figure of $1,000 is based on his evidence during the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     From [30] above, it appears that after deducting his monthly expenses, the Husband has a <em>cash</em> balance of <b><em>at least </em></b><b>$695.52/month</b>, if not more. I say “at least” because it is not disputed that for –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item [30(b)] – The mortgage ($1,978/month) is paid from the Husband’s CPF accounts – and not in cash.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item [30(g)] – The childcare fees ($339/month) can be paid from the daughter’s CDA. This account is presently managed by the Husband. The child is now over the age of two. Under the Baby Bonus Scheme, there will be a top up of $400 every six months into her CDA until she is six and a half years old: see [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     If one were to exclude the Husband’s mortgage payment (because it is not paid from his monthly income), he will have <b><em>at least </em></b><b>$2,673.52/month</b> balance each month. In my view, the Husband can afford to pay to the Wife a sum of $650/month for the son’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Accordingly, I ordered that the Husband is to pay <b>$650/month</b> to the Wife for the <b>son’s maintenance</b>. This sum is to be paid into the Wife’s <b>UOB account xxx666</b> by the <b>15<sup>th</sup> day of each month</b>, <b>commencing</b> from <b>June 2025</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Before concluding, I wish to briefly address a point raised by the Husband. According to him, the Wife is making a “double claim” by asking him to cover the costs of both (1) hiring a domestic helper and (2) enrolling the children in childcare centres. The Husband submitted that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The helper can care for the son – there is no need to send him to childcare, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife should be made to choose either (1) or (2) – she should not have both.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife submitted that the Husband’s position is unreasonable:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife would not be able to care for the two children – a toddler and an infant – all by herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, while the domestic helper can assist with the household chores, she is not suitable for taking care of the children’s developmental needs. It is more appropriate to send them to childcare centres where there would be professionals to take care of their needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I find the Wife’s submission to be reasonable. Additionally, I wish to reiterate the following observations that I have made in the 2024 Decision at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>...</em> in addition to alleviating the Wife’s burden, a helper can allow the Wife to rejoin the workforce as soon as possible. This will provide the Wife with financial independence and the ability to have an income to maintain herself, the children and the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>...</em> the fact that the Wife has an income will also mean that there is less reliance on the Husband to finance her expenses. In other words, the Husband will also benefit from the employment of a helper.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>According to the Complainant’s Statement filed on 13 March 2025 (A1) at page 3, the Wife is “asking for fixed monthly maintenance of S$840”. This can give the impression that she is seeking child maintenance of $840 for both children.

Regarding Item (A), the Wife computed the son’s share by dividing the household’s monthly utilities ($150) equally between four persons. This results in the son’s share being $37.50. In my view, this is excessive. Logically, the adults’ share of the utilities (i.e., the Wife and the helper) ought to be higher than the children’s share (consisting of a toddler and an infant). Item (B) should be excluded. I had already ordered the Husband to pay $400/month towards the costs of getting a person to assist the Wife to care for the daughter and the newborn baby: see [2] above.My determination of $30/month for item (l) includes the expense items in [18(a)] and [18(f)].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>See https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>The Husband’s monthly income can be found in Exhibit R1 pages 27 to 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Based on [(a) + (b) + (c)] divide by 6.(a)Six months of annual bonus component [i.e., $17,936.70 divide by two] (b)Six months of AWS component [i.e., $6,138 divide by two](c)Six months’ income from October 2024 to March 2025 [i.e., $38,313]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>This is based on the average of the Wife’s “net wage” reflected in her income slips from September 2024 to February 2025.

She also gave evidence about a tracker which she says the Husband had planted on her, as well as a camera which the Husband had placed in the living room in a rattan box.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife also highlighted what she says is a pattern of escalating verbal abuse on the Husband’s part in the weeks leading up to this trial, which includes a text message that the Husband had sent on 24 Feb 2025 where he had allegedly tried to get her to have sex with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes continual harassment, that is usefully summarised in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37    To prove family violence under the “continual harassment” limb, the following must be established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.[note: 22]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Courts have recognised repetitive conduct that causes worry, emotional distress or annoyance as coming within the scope of “continual harassment” under limb (d): see e.g., Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Examples of continual harassment include the repeated use of vulgarities (<em>XFL v XFM</em> at [38]), entering the applicant’s room numerous times despite being aware that the applicant was not comfortable with this (<em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a>), and repeatedly texting an applicant and sending sexually explicit and humiliating pictures (<em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [13]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While the cases provide a flavour of what might constitute continual harassment, it goes without saying that the assessment of whether there had been any continual harassment in a given case is necessarily one that must be ascertained based on the facts and taking into account the context of those acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the present case, I found that the Husband had indeed committed family violence (specifically, continual harassment) by planting the tracker in the Wife’s handbag so as to keep tabs on her whereabouts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband did admit to planting the trackers – his reason is that he wanted to know where the Wife would go. In his words:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Husband:    Because she never tell me where she goes alright. She goes out without telling me and whenever I go home, alright, the, you know, the house is always in a mess and I was wondering, you know, as a housewife why the house is always in a mess, what have you been doing at home? Where do you go? Okay. So, I---as a husband, the husband, right, I think every husband would want to know where the ha---the wife go to and if the wife never---refuse to tell me, to tell the husband, of course the husband, you know, feels insecure and wants to find out very soon what’s going on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     While one may be able to understand the Husband’s anxiety at not knowing the Wife’s whereabouts – at the end of the day, a key element in the assessment of whether there had been continual harassment is whether the respondent <b><em>knew</em></b> that such an act would cause anguish, or was likely to cause anguish to the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the present case, I found that the Husband knew that planting the tracker was likely to cause anguish (<em>ie</em>, annoy) the Wife. This is because at the time the tracker was planted, relations between the Wife and the Husband were strained. The Husband did also acknowledge that the Wife might be distressed if she discovered the tracker.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband also stated, in his own words, that the Wife would get easily distressed and “triggered” over minor incidents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Given the Husband’s knowledge of the Wife’s disposition, and her emotional state of mind given this period of elevated tensions between the both of them, it was clear to me that he would know that planting the tracker was likely to cause her anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having found that there was an act of family violence committed – I turn next to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO. This is essentially a risk assessment where the court considers the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence against the applicant in the future. Some factors that the court will consider include: the reasons for the family violence, whether the family violence is a recent occurrence, and whether there are any material changes in circumstances: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the present case, I did not find it necessary to order a PPO. It is clear that this dispute arose out of the deterioration of marital relations between the parties. Parties did not have healthy ways of communicating with each other, expressing their needs and desires, and this torpedoed efforts to find common ground and rekindle the love that they must have once had.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     That being said, parties are going for counselling in an attempt to resolve their differences. To that end, the Husband did express his commitment to continuing with counselling sessions in the hopes of salvaging the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Husband had also stated and expressed his desire to keep the family together despite the fact that the Wife has commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He also stated that since the Wife discovered the tracker, he has not attempted to keep tabs on her whereabouts, nor had he attempted to plant other trackers in her handbags.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This suggested, to me, that the Husband had reflected on the impact that his actions in planting the tracker had on the Wife, and had taken steps to change his behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Given the points that I have sketched out above, I arrived at the conclusion that the risk of the Husband committing family violence against the Wife, in the future, was low and the circumstances therefore did not justify the need to order a PPO. In particular, I gave weight to the fact that the Husband genuinely wanted to save the marriage and appeared to be actively taking steps to repair his relationship with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I therefore dismissed the Wife’s application in SS 2327. Given that the Husband did not seek costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to the Women’s Charter 1961 in this judgment are references to the version in force before 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, p 34, lns 16 – 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, p 34 at lns 29 – 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, pp 34 – 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, p 38, lns 8 – 10.

This is an application by the Father to vary 2 existing court orders on 3 aspects; firstly regarding access to the child, secondly regarding the disposal of the matrimonial home, and thirdly regarding maintenance to be paid for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Of the original orders, the first was issued in January 2020, and this order was about the custody care and control, as well as access of the child. The second order was issued in March 2020, and this order dealt with disposal of matrimonial assets and maintenance of the child. Under this order, the Father was to pay a monthly sum of $1,750.00 for the maintenance of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both orders were made by consent of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In July 2024, the Father filed an application to vary the terms of the orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2024, the matter came for hearing before me. The Father’s counsel appeared on his behalf. The Mother represented herself. I heard both sides. I interviewed the child and ascertained his wishes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 21 February 2025, I issued my decision via a registrar’s notice. I made orders on all 3 issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Regarding access to the child, I made an order mostly to reflect his preferences and to suit his living arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On the disposal of the matrimonial home, I dismissed the Father’s prayer for interest on his share of the matrimonial home. I ordered costs in the Father’s favour to be deducted from the Mother’s share of the sale proceeds. I made orders to facilitate the carrying out of the sale of the home as ordered in the original order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On maintenance, I ordered the Father to pay to the Mother a monthly sum of $1,200.00 as the cash portion of child maintenance. I also ordered for the following expenses to be shared equally with the Mother:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_1\"></a>1.     Tuition / enrichment classes; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_2\"></a>2.     Year-end school expenses, including school uniform, school bags, textbooks and school shoes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father appeals against only the portion of my order regarding maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In the original order of March 2020, the parties had consented that the Father to pay a monthly sum of $1,750.00 as maintenance for the child of the marriage. For the avoidance of doubt, the monthly sum of $1,750.00 payable by the Father, consists of 70% of the Child’s monthly expenses (i.e. by salary ratio) which consists of the following items:</p> <table

It was something agreed to by both parents at the time of the original order. I do not find evidence that the relative means of the parents have changed significantly enough to warrant a change in their respective shares. I do not find that the figure is beyond the Father’s means. On the Father’s argument that he will be having more access time with the child, I find that the relative amounts of time spent by the child with either parent cannot yet be specified. The child will be in polytechnic, and he is able to travel independently. During my interview with him, he envisages spending time with each parent depending on where he would be.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Regarding tuition and year-end expenses, at the time of the hearing, the child has not yet obtained a place in polytechnic, so the fixed expenses he will incur were not known. However, tuition and year-end expenses are occasional and not dependent on time spent with either parent. I agree with the Father that it is fair and just for each parent to bear the child’s tuition and year-end expenses equally. I depart from the 70% share for the Father for this item because I find that it is fair and just to do so in view of the Father bearing the child’s polytechnic and university expenses solely.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial Proceedings – Ancillary Matters"],"date":"2025-05-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1550 of 2022","title":"XMU v XMV","citation":"[2025] SGFC 58","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33280-SSP.xml","counsel":["Yap Teong Liang (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the applicant","Tan Keng Loon Clarence (UniLegal LLC) for the respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-05-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Patrick Tay Wei Sheng","html":"<root><head><title>XMU v XMV</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XMU <em>v</em> XMV </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33280-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 58</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1550 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Patrick Tay Wei Sheng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Yap Teong Liang (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the applicant; Tan Keng Loon Clarence (UniLegal LLC) for the respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XMU — XMV </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Proceedings</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The husband is a citizen of Singapore. The wife is a citizen of China. They married in 2018 and have no children. They fell out in or around 2022, and the husband commenced these proceedings for divorce that same year. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in 2023, and the ancillary matters of this divorce came before me for hearing. I upheld a pre-nuptial agreement between the spouses dated February 2018 that ringfenced several assets that were owed solely by the wife from division in a divorce between the spouses. I thus found that the value of the pool of matrimonial assets in these proceedings was $936,000 and divided it 55:45 in favour of the husband. I also declined to order any spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These decisions were rendered on 14 November 2024. On 27 November 2024, the husband wrote to the court expressing his intention to file an appeal against these decisions but stating that technical difficulties were preventing him from doing so. With the consent of the wife, the time for the filing of the appeal was extended, and the husband filed the appeal on 17 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I now provide my reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2018 Agreement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the 2018 Agreement,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> which related to several assets that had been acquired by the wife before the marriage. These assets comprised three bank accounts in the sole name of the wife (two with DBS Bank and one with Citibank) that had a total value of $1,966,613 at the time of these proceedings as well as four apartments in Shanghai, China for which no valuation was provided. For convenience, I refer to these assets as the “disputed assets”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Apart from these assets, the 2018 Agreement covered a company that the wife had incorporated in 2016, which was two years before the marriage. This company operated two businesses: the sale of medical devices and the conduct of education on medical aesthetics services. For convenience, I refer to this company as the “medical device company”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The 2018 Agreement prescribed that the disputed assets and the medical device company “shall NOT form part of the Parties’ matrimonial assets liable to division whether during the course of the marriage or upon the breakdown of the marriage” (see clause 11 of the 2018 Agreement). It confirmed that the wife was the “sole owner” of the medical device company and that all proceeds therefrom including “investments made/assets acquired and/or income derived from the Company and/or investments” were likewise excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets (see clause 12 of the 2018 Agreement). It recorded that each spouse was at liberty to deal with his/her pre-marital assets “including any subsequent asset derived [there]from” and that “any subsequent increment in value” of the pre-marital assets were likewise excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets (see clause 13 of the 2018 Agreement).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband asked me to disregard the 2018 Agreement because it had been “procured under coercions and/or duress and in bad faith.” He explained that it had been sent to him for his review only two days before the wedding, and that he had been coerced into signing it because “he had no other choice as preparations for the wedding etc was already done”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The wife replied that the 2018 Agreement should be upheld because the process by which it had been entered into was fair. First, she had asked the husband to seek independent legal advice on its terms prior to the marriage. Second, she had proposed to postpone the marriage had the husband required more time to consider its terms. Third, she had invited the husband to propose an addendum its terms even after the marriage, and he had declined to take up this invitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Pursuant to s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”), the court in dividing matrimonial assets may consider any agreement between the parties on the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets. Specifically, a pre-nuptial agreement that relates to the division of matrimonial assets between a set of spouses falls within the ambit of this provision (see <em>TQ v TR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0961.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</a> (“<em>TQ v TR</em>”) at [73]). Still, the task of the court in dividing a pool of matrimonial assets remains that of apportioning the fruits of the marriage in a just and equitable manner. Hence, the weight to be attached to a pre-nuptial agreement will depend on the circumstances of the case. Some factors that the court may consider in the matrimonial assets include the fairness of the process by which the pre-nuptial agreement had been reached and any pressure that one spouse had exerted on the other in the reaching of the pre-nuptial agreement (see <em>UKA v UKB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22133-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 779</a> at [21]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, the 2018 Agreement provided that it would be governed according to the law of the People’s Republic of China and required the spouses to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chinese courts in resolving all disputes and claims arising thereunder (see clause 17 of the 2018 Agreement). Upon my directions, the wife obtained and the husband did not challenge a legal opinion by a Chinese solicitor on the effect of this clause. The Chinese solicitor opined that the Chinese courts “generally uphold pre-nuptial agreements when dividing assets, giving full effect to clear terms and respecting the written stipulations agreed upon by the parties.” Specifically, save that a Chinese court would not exercise jurisdiction over assets located outside of the geographical territory of China, “it is highly likely that clauses 11, 12, and 13 of the [2018 Agreement] would be deemed valid and enforceable” and that “These clauses conform the legal provisions regarding asset division and protection within marriage under Chinese legislation”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Based on this legal opinion and given that the husband had submitted to the matrimonial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in commencing the divorce proceedings in Singapore, I found that the 2018 Agreement was a relevant factor in the these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As for the weight to be placed on the 2018 Agreement, I agreed with the wife that the process by which it had been entered had been fair. First, the husband had two full days to consider the 2018 Agreement but simply insisted that the wife was “being unreasonable and ridiculous” in putting it before him. Second, the husband had been urged to take independent legal advice before signing the 2018 Agreement but did not make any effort to seek such advice. Third, the husband could have delayed the wedding until after he had reviewed the 2018 Agreement but went ahead to enter into it. Fourth, the husband had a further opportunity even <em>after</em> the wedding to propose an addendum to the 2018 Agreement but declined to avail of this opportunity. I could not therefore agree with the husband that his entry into the 2018 Agreement had been procured by coercion, duress, or bad faith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The window that the husband had to review the 2018 Agreement had also to be considered in the context of the wider relationship between the then-spouses-to-be in respect of the business endeavours of the wife. The medical device company had been incorporated in 2016 with its entire shareholding issued to the husband. Four days later, the husband executed a declaration of trust that stipulated that the wife had the beneficial ownership of those shares.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Eleven months thereafter, the husband transferred the legal title of those shares to the wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Even as the husband served as a nominee director in the medical device company in the time that followed, he did so without any legal or beneficial interest therein. In this way, the then-spouses-to-be had structured the business to ringfence to the wife the title to and proceeds from the medical device company. As the husband admitted, he had despite his nominee directorship not been involved in the operations of the of the medical device company until he lost his job in “early 2018”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The ringfencing of the medical device company to the wife through the 2016 Trust was consistent with the roles that the then-spouses-to-be played in the medical device company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The 2018 Agreement ostensibly extended this ringfencing of the assets of the wife to survive an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage of the spouses. Thereunder, the ownership of and proceeds from the medical device company were ringfenced to the wife. Thereunder, too, the disputed assets, which comprised the bank accounts into which the proceeds from the medical device company had been paid as well as other assets that had been owned solely by the wife, were likewise ringfenced to the wife. In isolation, the two days that the husband had to review the 2018 Agreement may not have been a generous window. But in the context of the longstanding ringfencing to the wife of the medical device company and its proceeds, that window and the wider process by which the 2018 Agreement had been entered were generally fair. Consequently, it was just and equitable to uphold the 2018 Agreement and thereby exclude from these ancillary matters the medical device company and the disputed assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Valuation of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The matrimonial assets of significance, as set out in the Facts and Positions’ Sheets filed by each spouse, were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The matrimonial home (and the loan thereon);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband’s ice cream business;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband’s paintings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The husband’s Mercedes Benz E200 car;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The husband’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) balances;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The wife’s collection of luxury goods;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The wife’s Porsche 911 car; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The wife’s CPF balances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial home and loan thereon</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The matrimonial home was an apartment in Singapore that was held in the name of the husband. The wife initially submitted that it had a market value of $950,000 but subsequently argued that it had a value of $1,080,000. The husband submitted that its market value was $858,000, and, in any event, no more than $950,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To support the figure of $1,080,000, the wife adduced a valuation report from a firm of property valuers that was dated 20 September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The valuers had compared the matrimonial home with similar properties that had been transacted in comparable localities. But the valuers did not conduct any site inspection of the premises. Instead, they based their valuation on photographs and floor plans of the premises as well as the fact that the premises had been renovated in or around 2021 at a cost of $254,481.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In my view, the valuation of $1,080,000 by the valuers on 20 September 2024 was a reasonable estimate of the market value of the matrimonial home. This was the most up-to-date estimate of its market value and represented a fair value that could be realised from its sale. Indeed, the submission of the husband that the matrimonial home had a value of $950,000 was not far from this figure. Given that a sale of the matrimonial home would inevitably incur expenses that would reduce its eventual proceeds, I used $1,000,000 as its value in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It was undisputed that the outstanding loan on the matrimonial home was $369,510. The net value or equity of the spouses in the matrimonial home was thus <b><u>$630,490</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Vehicles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The spouses owned a car each. The husband owned a Mercedes Benz E200. The wife owned a Porsche 911.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the Mercedes Benz E200, the husband submitted that it had a market value of $133,800 and an outstanding loan of $77,830. The wife did not dispute these figures. The equity of this car in the pool of matrimonial assets was thus <b><u>$55,970</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     For the Porsche 911, the wife estimated, and the husband did not dispute, that it had a value of $250,000 as at September 2023. But the husband pointed out, and that wife did not dispute, that two months later, the Certificate of Entitlement of the car (the “COE”) was renewed at a cost of $140,000. The husband thus submitted that the car had a value of $400,000 at the time of these proceedings, which approximated the sum of the $250,000 value of the body of the car and the $140,000 fresh COE. The wife, however, maintained that the value of the car was $250,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As Choo Han Teck J observed in <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [1], the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets is the date of the interim judgment, which dissolves the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets is typically the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. Nevertheless, bank account balances and CPF account balances are be valued as of the date of the interim judgment. For such money accounts, the economic fruits of the marriage are the monies in the accounts rather than the accounts themselves. The quantum of the monies that represent the fruits of the marriage crystallises when the marriage is dissolved through the passing of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The interim judgment in these proceedings was granted in May 2023. At that time, the Porsche 911 comprised the body of the car and a soon-to-expire COE. The best estimate of the value of this car body and COE as at the hearing of the ancillary matters was $250,000. That, after the interim judgment, the wife had renewed the COE at a further expenditure of $140,000 was akin to her acquisition of a fresh asset <em>after</em> the marriage had been dissolved. Such an asset would not have been acquired “before the marriage” or “during the marriage” and could not therefore be a “matrimonial asset” within s 112(10) of the Charter. This was especially when the $140,000 expenditure appeared to have been paid by the wife other than from the matrimonial assets. The fresh COE, as distinct from the body of the car, could not therefore fall within the pool of matrimonial assets in these proceedings. The value of the Porsche 911 in the pool of matrimonial assets was thus <b><u>$250,000</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Remaining matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The remaining matrimonial assets were the CPF balances of each spouse, a collection of luxury goods that belonged to the wife, the husband, an ice cream business that was owned and operated by the husband, and two paintings that belonged to the husband. Apart from those CPF balances, however, there was a paucity of evidence on the values of the remaining matrimonial assets. This paucity was consistent with the manner that the spouses had ordered their financial affairs: each operated their own enterprise and each acquired their own possessions, as seen in their execution of the 2018 Agreement and the proposal by the wife that the husband, like her, put forward a list of his assets that were to be insulated from division in the event of a divorce. In these circumstances, it was just and equitable to have the spouses retain each of these remaining assets that were in their respective names and exclude these remaining assets from division in these proceedings. Still, if I was mistaken in so excluding from division these remaining assets, I set out my observations on their values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s paintings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the two paintings that belonged to the husband, the wife valued them at $5,000. The husband offered no value of his own on these paintings but submitted that they should in any event be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets because they were gifts from a friend. But no evidence was provided to support the fact of such a gift beyond the bare assertion of the husband. These paintings thus appeared to be matrimonial assets with a value of $5,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Each spouse’s CPF balances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The husband had a CPF balance of $111,824. The wife had a CPF balance of $0. These figures were not in dispute. I accepted these figures accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s luxury goods</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The luxury goods collection of the wife comprised bags, jewellery, and a coffee table. The husband submitted that the value of these luxury goods totalled $669,500. To support this claim, the husband adduced photographs of these items as well as receipts for four of the bags: a Dior pink saddle bag, a Dior white saddle calf bag, and Chanel bag, and a Birkin 25 gold bag. The wife replied that the value of these luxury goods was far less than $669,500 estimate provided by the husband. She claimed that the only items of value were the four bags that the husband had identified as well as a Birkin 30 blue bag with a value of $10,000 and a Van Cleef Arpels rose gold ring with a value of $1,500. She added that that the remaining items that the husband had identified were replicas without value and that the coffee table had been damaged and was likewise of limited value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the four bags for which the husband had identified, the wife made the following specific submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Dior pink saddle bag had been gifted to the wife’s mother as a birthday present while the marriage subsisted and no longer existed in the pool of matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Dior white saddle calf bag was a matrimonial asset; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Chanel bag and the Birkin 25 gold bag had been sold for $3,600 and $27,000 respectively, and that these proceeds were matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, it was convenient for the wife to claim that her collection of luxury goods comprised replicas without value apart from the four bags that the husband had identified, the Birkin 30 blue bag, and the Van Cleef Arpels rose gold ring. The husband had itemised the luxury goods (and their values)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and adduced photographs of most of these items. But the very nature of replicas made the authenticity of each item impossible to ascertain from photographs alone. Further, the values that the husband had ascribed to each item were based on his research on the internet, and did not appear to factor in the wear and tear on the items. Moreover, even though the wife did not expressly argue as such, it was uncertain which of these items had been purchased with proceeds from the medical device business and thus excluded from division in these proceedings pursuant to the 2018 Agreement. Still, insofar as the photographs depicted authentic luxury goods, it was incumbent on the wife to prove that they were replicas or were otherwise without value. With only bare assertions to that effect from the wife, I would observe that the value of the collection of luxury goods was likely closer to that put forward by the husband than that put forward by the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s ice cream business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The ice cream business of the husband had been incorporated before the marriage of the spouses. Although the husband owned the entirety of the shareholding of the ice cream business, it was not in dispute that the wife had invested at least $10,000 into the business during the marriage. The husband submitted that these investments were in “donations”, but regardless of the nature of the transfers, the monies went to the improvement of the business by financing marketing and operating expenditures.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The ice cream business was thus a matrimonial asset within s 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Charter, and the husband did not appear to contend otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     On the affidavits in these proceedings, apart from a profit-and-loss statement of the ice cream business that had been exhibited by the husband, there was little evidence on the value of the business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Still, as the husband admitted in his submissions, the business was a profitable one that earned “about $4,000 to $5,000 per month”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Annualising these figures would give a profit of at least $48,000 and possibly up to $60,000 each year. This was a stream of earnings that was not insubstantial. In all probability, such profits would have produced a business with significant value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Conclusion on remaining matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Ultimately, the evidence in these proceedings showed that the wife had a substantial collection of luxury goods while the husband had a substantial ice cream business that earned $48,000 to $60,000 each year. Taking account the likely values of these assets as well as those of the husband’s CPF balances and the husband’s paintings, and given that the spouses had throughout the marriage ordered and operated their financial affairs independently, I found it just and equitable to exclude from the pool of matrimonial assets and have each spouse retain in their own names respectively their CPF balances, the wife’s collection of luxury goods, the husband’s paintings, and the husband’s ice cream business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Based on my findings above, the pool of matrimonial assets had a value of approximately $936,460. This comprised the equity of in the matrimonial home ($630.490), the value of the Porsche 911 ($250,000), and the value of the Mercedes Benz E200 ($55,970).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The husband contributed $621,665 to the acquisition of these matrimonial assets. This sum comprised his contributions to the purchase of the matrimonial home ($238,093 in cash and $133,121 in CPF contributions), the renovation of the matrimonial home ($194,481), and the acquisition of the Mercedes Benz E200 ($55,970). The wife contributed $410,000 to the acquisition of these matrimonial assets: $100,000 towards the purchase of the matrimonial home, $60,000 to the renovation of the matrimonial home, and $250,000 to the acquisition of the Porsche 911. In my view, the renovation expenses were direct contributions to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets because the renovations that resulted were extensive and contributed to the eventual valuation of the property (see [15] above). The ratio of the spouses’ direct contributions to the purchase of the matrimonial assets was thus approximately 60:40 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For the indirect contributions of the spouses towards the acquisition of the matrimonial assets, I noted that the marriage was a short one of only five years’ duration, the spouses had no children, and the spouses worked throughout the marriage. I assessed these indirect contributions of the spouses at 50:50.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Taking the average of the ratios of direct contributions and indirect contributions, a fair and just apportionment of the pool of matrimonial assets was 55:45 in favour of the husband. I so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given the assets at the disposal of the wife after the marriage, especially the assets that had been ringfenced by the 2018 Agreement, the wife was well able to support herself. No maintenance for her was therefore necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the husband, there was no suggestion that he was incapacitated within s 114 of the Charter. There was thus no reason to order the wife to maintain him after the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of $936,460, were thus divided in the proportions of 55:45 in favour of the husband. To promote the amicable resolution of these matters, I encouraged the spouses to endeavour to agree on the mechanics of implementing this order of division. They were at liberty to apply for orders on such implementation were such agreement beyond them.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>1WAOM327</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>H’s Subs at pp 13–14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>W’s Subs at pp 13–15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Junhe Opinion at [5], [7], [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>1HAOM14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>1HAOM324</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>H’s Subs at p 12</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>NE 25/9/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Valuer’s Affidavit dated 17/10/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>H’s Subs at pp 7-8</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>1WAOM24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>2HAOM at Annex C</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>H’s Subs at p 10</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Probate – Duties of Executors and Trustees – Duty to Account – Testamentary Expenses"],"date":"2025-05-15","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSP 20/2024","title":"XLX v XLY and another","citation":"[2025] SGFC 51","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33272-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff acting in person","Defendants acting in person."],"timestamp":"2025-05-22T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XLX v XLY and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XLX <em>v</em> XLY and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33272-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 51</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OSP 20/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">15 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff acting in person; Defendants acting in person. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XLX — XLY — XLZ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Probate</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Duties of Executors and Trustees</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Duty to Account</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Testamentary Expenses</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">15 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff and defendants are siblings. They appeared in person for these proceedings. The defendants are the executors and trustees of their late mother’s estate. They obtained probate in July 2015. The plaintiff sought the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A fair and accurate statement of accounts relating to his late mother’s estate; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Timely execution of probate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The defendants provided accounts to the plaintiff after the application was filed. I found the information provided after such filing to be a fair and accurate account of the status of the estate of their late mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that no order was necessary in relation to the provision of accounts, I directed only that the defendants provide to the plaintiff his share of their late mother’s estate. There was considerable delay in the distribution of assets in no small part attributable to litigation between the parties over the ownership of 2 immoveable properties, namely, a HDB shophouse and a private residential property (immoveable properties). The ownership of these properties became an issue only after the parties’ father passed away in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As the hearing progressed, the main issue between parties appeared to be in relation to the amount the plaintiff stands to receive from his mother’s estate after testamentary expenses are paid. I had when issuing the orders, alerted them to the order of distribution so as to facilitate understanding. The plaintiff appeals against the orders made on the prayers sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The parties’ mother passed away in July 2013. She had executed a will which named the defendants as her executors and trustees. Much of the estate of their late mother was left to the first defendant including her share in the HDB shophouse and the private residential property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The grant of probate was obtained only in 2015 as the second defendant had a challenging pregnancy and took steps to obtain an order only after her child was born. A schedule of assets was filed which did not reflect the mother’s share in the HDB shophouse and the private residential property. This was because the properties were held by their parents and the plaintiff as co-tenants and they believed that the right of survivorship applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The parties’ father passed away in June 2019. The first defendant was named the executor and trustee of his father’s estate. In the father’s will, he had stated that his share of the HDB shophouse and the private residential property were to be given to the first defendant. All other assets were provided to either the first or the second defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> From the tenor of the father’s will, the defendants began to understand that the parents never intended the plaintiff to benefit from the properties and that the HDB shophouse was being held by the plaintiff on trust for his parents. The defendants then filed an amendment to the schedule of assets for the mother’s estate to include her share of the 2 properties. This gave rise to a separate set of proceedings in HC/S 793/xxxx (S 793) as the defendant disputed the position. The court in S 793 found that the plaintiff held the HDB shophouse on trust for his parents and he was ordered to transfer interest, title and rights in the same to the defendants as executors and trustees of their mother’s estate and to the first defendant an executor and trustee of their father’s estate. In relation to the private residential property, the plaintiff was similarly ordered to transfer his rights in the property to the estates of their parents. Upon such transfer, the estates were to pay to the plaintiff the monies that were paid by him towards the 2 properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It was only in late 2023 that the transfers were effected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In relation to their late mother’s estate, the second defendant and the plaintiff stood to inherit a relatively small part leaving the bulk to the first defendant. More particularly, the plaintiff stood to inherit only the monies in 2 Citibank accounts totalling $42 614.33.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Have the defendants provided a fair and accurate account?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As executors and trustees, the defendants owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, an important aspect of which is the duty to keep accounts and to provide beneficiaries with the same when called on to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This duty is a continuous one.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> If an order is made for the taking of accounts either on a common or wilful default basis, the process is distinct and Rules 684-686 of the Family Justice Rules (2014) would need to be complied with and consequential orders made arising from the taking of such accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The defendants had in their affidavit in reply<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> provided a table accounting for the assets collected, the date and the value of such collected assets, the expenses incurred and payable from the estate including the date of payment of such expenses and the assets not called in as yet.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I was satisfied that this was a fair and accurate statement of accounts. The plaintiff disagreed but, in his affidavit, it was unclear as to why he took issue with the information produced. During the hearing however, he provided positions as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That there are several assets which were not put into the schedule of assets. He did not however identify those omitted assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That he paid towards the price of the immoveable properties and that should not be written as a debt. The order by the court in S 793 however speaks of the need for the defendants to reimburse from the estates, the amounts paid by the plaintiff towards the properties in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the legal costs arising from the lawsuit in S 793 should not be included as it related to the estates of both parents. I did not agree with this as both estates formed the subject matter of the lawsuit and the issue of the rights of both estates was inextricably linked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That item 3.2 in the table provided by the defendants should reflect a figure of about $6 000. The defendants explained that this was a sum in a joint account held by their father and the first defendant and that the law of survivorship enabled the surviving account holder to keep this money, thus explaining the nil value.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     That item 8 should indicate a surrender value when the defendants had indicated that no value was in fact obtained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     That item 9 should state a value. It was explained that this item referred to a MSIG insurance policy and they had not heard from the insurance company at the time of this hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     That item 11 should have a value ascribed. This too related to a policy with AVIVA Ltd. and for which no information had yet been received.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_h\"></a>(h)     That the values of the 2 immoveable properties should be reflected. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is entitled to his mother’s share in these properties and the values are reflected in the table.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>(i)     That no documentation of testamentary expenses have been exhibited. There is reflection of the total amount incurred supported by invoice numbers and correspondence, although it is accepted that the full set of invoices have not been produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Are the defendants in breach of timely execution of probate?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In relation to the second prayer for the timely execution of the probate, I agree that the defendants in their fiduciary capacities need to act in a timely manner to ensure that all beneficiaries receive their shares of the estate. Having said that, it was noted that Clause 3 of the will of their late mother allowed for the defendants to postpone the sale, calling in and conversion of assets without being responsible for any loss occasioned by that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I do not believe there was an intention to avoid providing the plaintiff with his entitlement. At Clause 3 (I) of the will, all the money in their late mother’s Citibank accounts were to be provided to the plaintiff. The amounts that are contained in the Citibank bank accounts are known. The defendants have set up an estate account but no beneficiary has received his/her share yet. As the plaintiff did not seek the removal of the defendants as executors and trustees or any alternative means of obtaining his rightful share, seeking only for timely distribution of the assets, the defendants were directed to act on distribution immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I accepted that the lack of timely distribution was largely on account of the fact that the passing of their father in 2019 opened up concerns about the plaintiff’s rights to the immoveable properties. The parties were locked in litigation over the ownership of the immoveable properties which was concluded only about 6 months prior to the instant application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The actual dispute - unaddressed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Even as the plaintiff sought to identify by means of oral submissions, his areas of contention with the accounts provided and for an order that the defendants act on probate obtained, what he appeared to in fact be asking for is his entitlement to the entire sum of $43 614.33 found in his mother’s 2 Citibank accounts. In fact, the distributable amount in these accounts have increased to $43 819 as evidenced in the table produced by the defendants.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>The defendants however were of the view that it ought to be reduced on account of the net value of the assets of the estate excluding the 2 immoveable properties from the asset pool. Given the testamentary expenses indicated to be $138 112.50 which sum included legal costs arising from previous litigation, they argued that it had to be shaved off the gross value held in their late mother’s account which they say total $316 665.42, leaving a net balance of the estate to be distributed at only $178 552.92. They stated that they were advised by their lawyers that the gross value of the estate should not include the immoveable properties as the properties were not immediately available for distribution.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> It was their position that the plaintiff’s entitlement to $42 614.33 which represents 13.46% of the gross value of the estate (excluding the immoveable properties) would therefore result in only an amount of $24 028.24 of the net value of their mother’s accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I had when issuing my decision alerted the parties to what appears to be at the heart of their dispute. While it appears from the plaintiff’s application and supporting affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> that he wanted a fair and accurate statement of accounts and timely distribution of the assets, he appears to in fact be taking issue with the defendants’ position that the immoveable properties should not be brought into the equation when determining the net value of their late mother’s estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> If it were included, the net value of the assets would be significantly increased. I repeat the observations I made when issuing my decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Although the plaintiff had sought a fair and accurate account of the estate, the underlying dispute appears to be with regards the exact entitlement of the plaintiff. This is outside the ambit of the prayers. Parties are to refer to s 57 of the Probate and Administration Act, 1934 (PAA) which provides for the manner of administration of assets and in particular s 57(4) of the Act which provides:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“Where the estate of a deceased person is solvent his estate shall, subject to the Rules of Court and section 58 as to charges on property of the deceased, and to the provisions, if any, contained in his will, be applicable to the discharge of the funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, debts and liabilities payable thereout in the order mentioned in the Second Schedule”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Where there then is deficiency to meet the interests of all beneficiaries, it would be up to the party who says he has clear priority over other beneficiaries to show why this is so from the wording of the testator’s will or other evidence. As the plaintiff has not sought nor made any submissions with regards priority or in its absence, how the distribution is to be borne, the Court can make no further orders.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The order of application of assets where an estate is solvent is provided in the Second Schedule of the PAA as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Property of the deceased undisposed of by will, subject to the retention thereout of a fund sufficient to meet any pecuniary legacies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Property of the deceased not specifically devised or bequeathed but included (either by a specific or general description) in a residuary gift, subject to the retention out of such property of a fund sufficient to meet any pecuniary legacies, so far as not provided for as aforesaid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Property of the deceased specifically appropriated or devised or bequeathed (either by a specific or general description) for the payment of debts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Property of the deceased charged with, or devised or bequeathed (either by a specific or general description) subject to a charge for the payment of debts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The fund, if any, retained to meet pecuniary legacies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Property specifically devised or bequeathed, rateably according to value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Property appointed by will under a general power, rateably according to value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The provisions shall also apply:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The order of application may be varied by the will of the deceased; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Schedule does not affect the liability of land to answer the death duty imposed thereon in exoneration of other assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     If the defendants take the position that the value of the immoveable properties called in should not be added to the pool from which the testamentary expenses are to be deducted, leaving therefore an insufficient amount in the account for all specific legatees to receive their entitlement, they would need to make an application for such determination. Indeed, the classification of the gift to the plaintiff as a specific legacy may in itself be subject to challenge. Conversely, if the immoveable properties are agreed to be brought into the pool for distribution but there is still an insufficiency to meet all the claims of the beneficiaries, there needs also to be a determination of the correct reduction for each beneficiary proportionate to the net value of the estate. The parties were somewhat limited by a lack of legal representation to advance their cases. In any event, the prayers sought were not in line with what was at the heart of the dispute. The parties are open to file an application for consideration of the issue under appropriate legislative provisions if they are not in agreement on the order of distribution. At this time, the defendants cannot decide unilaterally to hold on to the plaintiff’s share unless and until the plaintiff agrees to accept a smaller sum. There is significant guidance on how assets are to be marshalled to meet the entitlement of legatees, the issue of priority of claims and circumstances which may lead to reduction or even abatement of claims.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Appropriate prayers would need to be drafted, and submissions made if this remains unresolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The statement of account provided by the defendants is a fair and accurate one. The legal costs incurred by the defendants for the lawsuit to determine the entitlement of their late mother to the immoveable properties forms part of the expenses to be discharged before distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The transfer of the plaintiff’s interest in the immoveable properties had taken significant time to be effected, largely on account of the litigation surrounding the status of the immoveable assets. Additionally, information relating to 2 insurance policies remain outstanding at the time of the hearing. None of the beneficiaries have received their share of the estate. The defendants have been directed to act on the probate and provide the plaintiff his entitlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even as the plaintiff sought for an account and the timely execution of probate, the real dispute for which an order was not prayed for nor adequately argued centred on whether the plaintiff was entitled to the full sum in the Citibank accounts. Any dispute with respect to this issue would necessitate further steps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Each party was ordered to bear his/her own costs for these proceedings. Parties acted in person, had filed one affidavit each and did not address the core concern. Even if a court is minded to provide direction to parties in person to facilitate presentation of their cases adequately and in so doing, achieve closure, it needs to be mindful of its primary role, which is to adjudicate disputes. The plaintiff appeared to be asking the court to inform him of what the law is with respect to the order of distribution of estate assets. There are various arguments that can be mounted insofar as the position parties took on this issue. It would be wrong for a court to make a decision without understanding the reasons for the position each took and the law they base those positions on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Given that the amount in question is relatively modest, I would encourage parties, and particularly the plaintiff, to agree to mediation, a step he declined when offered at an earlier case conference.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Clauses 3A and B of the will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>FC/P4092/xxxx.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Pages 23-25 of the defendants’ affidavit filed on 14 October 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Schedule of Assets (Amendment No.1) filed on 3 March 2020 in DCP 4681/xxxx.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><b><em>Lalwani Shalini Gobind &amp;

To that end, any orders which are made, are made with only one purpose in mind, and that is to protect. These orders, for example, a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) or the Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) are not meant to punish Respondents to such applications, and that much is made clear by the jurisprudence of the Family Courts (for example, see the case of <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 2420/2024 (“SS 2420”) was the Wife’s application for a PPO for herself and the two children against the Husband. She also sought a DEO to exclude the Husband entirely from their residential property. The incident which formed the basis of the Wife’s application had taken place on 12 December 2024. The Husband had suspected her of cheating on him. There was an argument. In the midst of this argument, the Husband had taken a knife to threaten the Wife. The police were called. The Husband was arrested and subsequently released on bail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of the matter on 21 March 2025 and allowed the Wife’s application in SS 2420. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       An Applicant seeking a PPO must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The first is that there was an act of family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that it was likely that the Respondent would commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second requirement is that the PPO is necessary for the protection of the family member in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the present case, I found it likely that the Husband would commit family violence on Wife as well as the two children. The Wife had adduced text messages to show that the Husband had lost control and severely caned his son. It is clear from these text messages,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> which the Husband had sent to the Wife on the 3rd of December 2024, that he had indeed lost control and caned his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       During his testimony, the Husband did not dispute that he had lost control. In fact, he went on to say that he estimated that he had hit his son about 20 to 30 times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Apart from this incident, in the incident on the 12th of December 2024, the Husband had admitted to stabbing the knife, which was a rather large knife (with a blade that was 17cm long),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> onto the table in a fit of rage:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"16.9%\"><col width=\"83.1%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">So, I go down and take the knife out. I didn’t hide the knife. I told the police, “You scan the knife. If got a single ounce of bath soap or anything, you catch me.” I didn’t hide the knife. I let my daughter saw but maybe she remember the wrong timing. I go down take the knife out. I pass to her. Asked her, “You want to commit suicide? Commit suicide.” She refuses. <b>She keep asking me to kill her. I got so angry, I take the knife, I stab on the table then I realised that it’s a bit dangerous. I took the knife. I asked my son to keep it.</b> My son came out, he keep---he kept the knife. Then she continued to take her eyebrow trimmer to try and commit suicide. I look at it, I thought that she is just joking, lah. The eyebrow trimmer, the blade is like maybe the size of a toothpick. It is a very small blade. I just think that she’s just joking, lah. Then I tell her, “Eh, like that won’t die one. You want to die, go and take the iron pills.” I said it as a joke.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[emphasis added] </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is thus apparent to me from these 2 incidents, and the manner in which the Husband had described his account of these incidents, that he does have difficulty in controlling his temper, and that he is prone to violent outbursts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In addition, it is also clear that the Husband is not above resorting to means to manipulate those that he purports to love to do his bidding. He had given evidence of how he had devised means of getting the Wife to have sex with him. He would pretend to cheat on her by hiring escorts to make her jealous as he realised that if he could make her jealous, she would be willing to have sex with him. As he explained:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.64%\"><col width=\"79.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">As for the---as for what she said about the sex thing, when she’s angry, she cut off sex for 1 whole year. The only time that she re-established sex is when she realised that I was contacting my ex-girlfriend. And it wasn’t for any bad things. I just contacted her to say thank you for what happened 4 years ago, okay. She was so jealous that she had sex with me. So, I thought that every time I make her jealous, she will have sex with me. So, I tell her say I visit prostitute. She refuse to believe me because all the accounts, all the bank accounts are joint accounts, she have access to them and she can where the money goes. And she knows that I didn’t spend a single cent. So, I cannot be visiting prostitutes. So, I ran out on [inaudible] I thought of the best idea I can come up with, right, is just to ask my maid. Because my maid is her best friend. My maid has been with us 7 plus years. If I want to have some hanky panky with my maid, I won’t wait 7 years later, okay. As for the prostitute in Taiwan when we go on a Taiwan trip, she say that I---I go and find a prostitute. Yes, I did find a prostitute but I paid the prostitute to say that we have sex but I didn’t have sex with the prostitute. Why? Because when I come back home, she knows this very well, I have sex with her. I’m [X] years old this year, [Y] years old. I cannot have sex 2 consecutive times one. I keep telling her this now. All that I say in the past is just trying to make her jealous so that she have sex with me, and it’s true. She---she---she got so jealous, she started to started to start a tracking system to track how many time we had sex in month. So, my plan worked. You can check her phone. That is for the sex thing, I have never cheated on my wife. But it’s very difficult, I don’t know if you all can understand, that when a wife withhold sex for 1 whole year, is very difficult for a man to try to control. And this is why I come up with these funny ideas.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from this, there is one other point, and that was the Husband’s need for control. It was apparent to me that the Husband was very paranoid about the possibility that the Wife may have cheated on him. The Husband spoke of how he had established a system with the Wife after he suspected her of cheating on him with his friend from the army. Under this system, he would be able to video call the Wife to check on her. And if the Wife had missed this call, she had to call him back immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     That the Husband established such a system spoke volumes as to his mindset. I found it to be the case that the Husband expected the Wife to comply, and that if she did not do so, there would be consequences. Indeed, the lengths which the Husband went to, to check on whether the Wife had been cheating on him on the 12th of December 2024, spoke to the depths of his paranoia and his need for control. For example, he had asked the Wife to remove her underwear to “check for any signs of sex”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In this connection, I also believe the Wife’s account: that the Husband had indeed told her that if he could not have her, then nobody else could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Taken together, the evidence before me painted a picture of a man who was not only controlling, but manipulative and prone to violent outbursts. It was also evident that his actions had negatively impacted those he claimed to hold most dear – the Wife’s testimony spoke to how she had tolerated his behaviour for many years, and how matters had, for her, finally reached a breaking point. This also made it apparent that the Husband had little to no self-awareness on his part. Given this, I concluded that it was indeed likely that the Husband would commit family violence on the Wife, as well as the two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     For completeness, I would add that while much was made of how the Husband may have had an underlying psychiatric condition, namely, borderline personality disorder (“BPD”), there was nothing on the evidence before me (<em>ie</em>, in the form of a doctor’s report) to indicate that this was indeed the case. That being said, I have concluded (above at [7] – [14]) that there were indeed very troubling aspects of the Husband’s personality and behaviour which pointed to the likelihood of him committing family violence on the Wife and children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I must emphasise that the law does not require an Applicant to prove that family violence had actually been committed. It suffices to show that family violence is likely to be committed, and that is set out in the words of s 65 of the Women’s Charter 1961: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having found that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence, I turned to consider whether it was necessary to grant the PPO. In this vein, the law also says that once it is found that the Respondent is likely to commit family violence, a PPO is presumptively necessary: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [121] citing <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On the evidence before me, and leaving aside any presumption, I am indeed satisfied that a PPO was necessary to protect both the Wife and the children and that is because of the Husband’s uncontrolled displays of anger. There were, at least on the evidence before me, two examples of him doing so, in relation to him caning his son as well as him stabbing the knife onto the desk in a fit of anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The risk of family violence, in my judgment, was further increased when one took into account the Husband’s controlling and manipulative personality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In addition, I also found it necessary to order a DEO to exclude the Husband from the entire property. Physical separation was necessary to ensure the safety of the Wife as well as the two children. This is especially since the Husband had not only displayed a propensity for uncontrolled displays of violence, but had also told the Wife that if he could not have her, nobody else could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus allowed the Wife’s application in SS 2420. In the circumstances, I also ordered that both the Wife and the Husband were to attend counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Given that the Wife did not seek costs of her application, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Bundle of Documents at p 20.

The Respondent is 32 years old this year. The Complainant and the Respondent never married. They were in a relationship when they were teenagers but have not been in touch since sometime in 2011.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 8 May 2024, the Complainant filed an application for maintenance for her child who is 13 years old this year (the “Child”). At the start of the trial, the Respondent took the position that the Child was not his biological child. This was subsequently resolved by way of a paternity test, after which the Respondent accepted that he was the biological father of the Child. I hereinafter refer to the Complainant as the “Mother” and the Respondent as the “Father”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Having heard the parties’ evidence on 24 October 2024 and their submissions on 7 February 2025, I ordered the Father to pay the Mother a sum of $750 per month as maintenance for the Child, as well as a total sum of $6,750 as backdated maintenance for the Child. I also ordered the Father to pay costs of the proceedings fixed at $500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father has since filed an appeal against my orders relating to the maintenance payable for the Child as well as my orders relating to the backdated maintenance ordered. I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 7 February 2025, just before parties were asked to provide their oral submissions on the matter, the Father requested to furnish some documents purporting to show that the Mother was living a luxurious life, changing new cars, and carrying branded bags, including one that he said cost about $15,000. I did not allow these documents. By this time, both parties had already given their testimony on the witness stand, completing their evidence on 24 October 2024. The Father did not inform the Mother ahead of time of his intention to provide these documents, and offered no satisfactory explanation as to why he did not put forth this evidence any earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal requirements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”) provides that the court may order maintenance for a child on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. In making its determination, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the financial needs of the child, and the income and financial resources of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother sought payment of $750 per month as maintenance for the child. In addition, she sought backdated maintenance of $1,500 per month for a period of 200 months. The Mother estimated the Child’s monthly expenses to be about $1,900 per month, but sought $750 per month as this was what she believed the Father would be able to afford. The backdated maintenance was calculated based on what the Mother calculated to be the amount she had spent on the Child since his birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father objected to the Mother’s application. The Father says that he is unable to afford the maintenance sought by the Mother. The Father proposed to contribute $200 to $250 per month, being what he says is the maximum he can afford.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Child’s reasonable expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first considered what the Child’s reasonable expenses were.

In my assessment, the Child’s reasonable expenses amounted to approximately $1,800 per month, which was not far from the figure estimated by the Mother. To explain:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I assessed the Child’s reasonably monthly expenses to be about $120 lower than that estimated by the Mother as I felt that the Child’s medical fees and clothing expenses were too high and were not supported by the objective evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the amount spent on food and groceries at $1,000 per month seemed a little high, I accepted that the Mother’s circumstances in raising the Child as a single parent may have placed certain limitations on the extent of care that she could provide for the Child, which may have consequently necessitated such higher costs. For example, not having the time to prepare home-cooked meals for the Child may have resulted in her spending more to buy meals home or to have food delivered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Similarly, I accepted that juggling two jobs may have left the Mother with less time and energies to coach the Child at home or to help him through his academic work. I therefore found her estimated expenses of $280 per month on enrichment and tuition classes for the Child to be justified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties’ incomes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I next considered the parties’ finances. The Mother worked two jobs, one as a part-time administrative assistant earning $1,500 per month, and the other from a cloud kitchen she owned, where she received a salary of $2,000 per month. In total, the Mother claims to earn an income of $3,500 per month. The Father did not dispute this. I found that the Mother’s position was more or less supported by the payslips and bank account statements she provided. I therefore accepted that she earned $3,500 per month for the purposes of this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father ran a canteen stall at a secondary school. He indicated in his statement that his monthly income was $2,500,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> but at trial he claimed to earn about $2,000 to $2,300 per month, with the latter figure being what he might earn in a “good month”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> However, this was not supported by the documentary evidence provided, and I was not convinced that the Father only earned up to $2,300 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father’s IRAS Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2024 showed that he earned $2,536.08 per month on average in the latest year of assessment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> While the Father asserted that this amount included what he earned from driving that year, he offered no objective evidence showing this to be the case. Even if this did comprise some supplementary income he earned from private hire driving, I saw no good reason why this could not continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, the Father testified at trial that he paid his stall assistant about $2,400 to $2,600 per month. Again, he did not provide any documents showing this. I found it inconceivable that he would pay his employee more than he claimed to take home for himself. If this was indeed the case, he may well be financially better off working as a stall assistant instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the balance of the evidence, for the purposes of this application, I found that the Father earned a minimum monthly income of $2,500. I accordingly adopted this figure to derive the income ratio between the parties at 58% to 42% in the Mother’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Applying this ratio to what I had found to be the Child’s reasonable expenses at $1,800, I found that the Father’s share would amount to about $750 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father declared personal monthly expenses of $2,276.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He said that he would be unable to meet the monthly maintenance payments sought by the Mother as he has various financial obligations arising from his prospective marriage and his father’s medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I did not find the Father’s claims to be made out on the evidence provided:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s declared monthly expenses included an amount of $1,000 per month as allowance for his parents. However, there was no proof that he would withdraw this amount in cash to pay to his parents each month. His mother continued to work and operate a canteen stall in the same school as the Father, and there was no proof that his parents needed or expected this much from him, considering that this amounted to more than 40% of what he says he earned. there was also no proof that his parents needed this money, particularly when his mother continued to work and operate a canteen stall in the same school as the Father. The Father also did not provide any evidence showing his father’s medical condition, or of the costs incurred by his father for his medical condition, such as to justify this amount of $1,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It was also clarified at trial that the Father’s estimates for his expenses on conservancy charges and internet, as stated in his list of expenses, were estimates for a household of four. His own share of these two expenses should therefore only be $69 instead of $276.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father also did not provide any evidence showing the extent to which his prospective marriage impinged on his ability to pay any maintenance ordered. The Father said that his flat was “coming next year”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, but did not provide any indication of the financial outlay required, or of his partner’s ability to contribute to this undertaking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I accordingly found that the Father would be able to meet the maintenance payments of $750 per month if he were to make some adjustments to his own lifestyle and expenditure. The Mother herself would have had to make sacrifices and adjustments to her own lifestyle to meet her financial obligations, not least the expenses of the Child, who was born of both parties, but for the past 13 years has been the Mother’s sole responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As the Father had not made any financial contributions towards the Child, I found in the circumstances of the case that he had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child and that it was reasonable to order that he pays the Mother a sum of $750 per month as maintenance for the Child. I ordered this to be paid on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month, with effect from 21 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     However, I did not find it appropriate to order backdated maintenance of the amounts and for the duration sought by the Mother. On the Mother’s own account, it was only in February 2024 that she obtained the Father’s contact. It appeared that it was only thereafter that she attempted to seek maintenance from him, in part motivated by her family’s financial situation. The Mother’s evidence was in fact that she could not and did not contact the Father after the Child was born, and it was not disputed that the Father had blocked her on WhatsApp and on Facebook. The Mother could have brought an application for maintenance at any time and did not satisfactorily explain why she had not done so earlier. In fact, I noted that when the parties met about three or four years after the Child was born, the Mother’s then-husband expressly told the Father to stay away from her and the Child,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> which reasonably gave rise to the Father’s impression that the Mother wanted nothing more from him in relation to the Child. I therefore did not find it fair to make the Father responsible for the expenses the Child had incurred prior to the application, where the circumstances were such that he would have reasonably assumed that the Mother did not want or require any such contribution from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, despite having notice of the Mother’s intentions and of the Child’s needs since the commencement of this application, the Father did not make any contributions to the Child’s expenses, even if only of the amounts of $200 to $250 per month that he said he was able pay. I therefore ordered that the maintenance orders be backdated to May 2024, when the Mother commenced this application. Taking into account the Father’s financial resources, I ordered that the total arrears of $6,750 (being the arrears accrued from May 2024 to January 2025) shall be paid in instalments of $250 per month, payable on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month with effect from 21 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother sought costs from the Father of between $2,000 to $2,500. The Father objected to this, reasoning that he was unable to afford this. I found that some costs would be payable by the Father to the Mother, bearing in mind the delay occasioned by the Father’s insistence that he was not the biological father of the Child, and the fact that the quantum of monthly maintenance sought by the Mother was reasonable and ultimately aligned with what I ordered. However, I did not find it appropriate to order the full amount sought by the Mother as she was substantially unsuccessful in the bulk of her claim relating to backdated maintenance, which I did not find to be reasonable. I therefore ordered costs of $500 payable by the Father to the Mother. To give the Father more time to pay, given his new obligations, I ordered that this amount of $500 be payable by 28 February 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 24 October 2024 (“NE1”), p 62 lines 23 - 24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Father’s documents filed on 2 July 2024 (“F1”), p 6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE1, p 36 lines 21 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>F1, p 22</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>F1, p 11 - 13</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE1, p 62 lines 22 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE1, p 22 lines 9 - 12</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2025-05-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4805 of 2021 (Summons No 3502 of 2024)","title":"XIE v XIF","citation":"[2025] SGFC 50","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33232-SSP.xml","counsel":["Faustina Joyce Fernando, Linda Joelle Ong (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the plaintiff","Eileen Lim (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-05-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XIE v XIF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XIE <em>v</em> XIF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33232-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 50</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4805 of 2021 (Summons No 3502 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">05 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Faustina Joyce Fernando, Linda Joelle Ong (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the plaintiff; Eileen Lim (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XIE — XIF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">5 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 3502/2024 (“SUM 3502”) which was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. The substantive decision in respect of the Husband’s application can be found in <em>XIE v XIF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32869-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 22</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that costs should be reserved to the Judge hearing the substantive variation application in SUM 2713/2024 (“SUM 2713”). Their argument is premised on the merits of SUM 3502 being inextricably linked to the merits of the variation application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In that vein, counsel for the Wife argues that the Judge hearing SUM 2713 is best placed to “decide if the documents and information” that the Husband had sought were necessary for the fair disposal of the variation application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In addition, counsel for the Wife also argued that she ran the risk of “severe prejudice” if she was ordered to pay costs now and the variation application in SUM 2713 was dismissed, and the hearing Judge did not “deem it necessary to consider [her] income and expenses documents”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On the other hand, counsel for the Husband argued that he should be entitled to costs given that he had succeeded in SUM 3502. However, counsel for the Husband argued that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis, fixed at $4132.40 (all-in), as her withholding of these “standard documents and information” was “manifestly unreasonable” and had caused needless delay and wasted resources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Husband also argues that the Wife had adopted an adversarial stance by refusing to reasonably disclose the documents sought, which necessitated the application in SUM 3502.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Costs should not, in my judgment, be reserved to the hearing Judge in the present case. I do not agree with the arguments advanced by counsel for the Wife. Their premise is that the merits of SUM 3502 are inextricably linked to the merits of the variation application in in SUM 2713. This argument, when driven to its natural conclusion, would mean that costs for applications for discovery and interrogatories, must always be reserved to the hearing Judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       That cannot be right. In assessing the merits of SUM 2713, the hearing Judge is not, as counsel for the Wife sought to suggest, assessing whether the discovery and interrogatories were indeed necessary for the fair disposal of the matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> While the hearing Judge may find, or express the view, that certain documents produced in discovery did not factor into their decision, this does not necessarily mean that the application for discovery and interrogatories had been unreasonably taken out. After all, the provision of documents and answers through discovery and interrogatories also enables the requesting party to formulate their position in relation to the substantive dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that the Husband had indeed succeeded in his application, he is entitled to costs, which I fix at $1632.40 (all-in).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> These costs are to be paid to the Husband by 9 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In arriving at this quantum, I considered the number of items sought, and that the written submissions and hearing before me were relatively short. In particular, I also took into account the fact that the Wife did have ample opportunities to make voluntary disclosure of these documents, which would not only have avoided the need for SUM 3502, but would also have facilitated mediation which may well have borne fruit. This was, in my judgment, a factor warranting an upward adjustment in the quantum of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at paras 3 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6(b) which states: “The hearing judge determining the variation application will be best placed to decide if the documents and information sought were necessary for the fair disposal of the variation application in the first place.

This application for a personal protection order (PPO) was filed by the Father on behalf of the three (3) children of the marriage, C1, C2 and C3 on 4 November 2024, at the doorstep of the hearing of the ancillary matters (AMs) fixed on and heard by me on 19 December 2024. The circumstances as to why the application was filed and the procedural history of the divorce proceedings are relevant and would be set out at the appropriate portions of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and History of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother left the matrimonial home with the 3 children on 23 May 2021. On 9 July 2021, the Father took the eldest child, C1 from his school and since then C1 has been living with the Father at the matrimonial home to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both Parents filed for interim care and control of the 3 children; the Mother filed her application on 11 April 2022 while the Father filed his application on 11 May 2022. Both applications were heard on 27 July 2022 with the decision rendered on 29 July 2022. The Father was granted interim care and control of C1 while the Mother was granted interim care and control of C2 and C3.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Access orders were made such that each parent was to take access of the child/children not under her/his respective care and control on alternate weekends. In line with therapeutic justice principles, both parents were asked to attend the session during which the Court delivered its decision. I explained to the parents that I was prepared to let status quo remains so as not to cause a destabilising situation for C1 in view of his near and upcoming Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE). The parents were also strongly encouraged to step away from their litigious mindset to focus on preparing C1 for the PSLE and giving him the necessary moral and emotional support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The access arrangements went on thereafter for over 1 ½ years while the case was being managed and prepared for hearing on the AMs by the case conferencing team. Sometime from February 2024, access for both parents ceased and regrettably, they have not had any access to the child/children not under their respective interim care and control since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The AMs were originally fixed for hearing before me on 23 October 2024. However, that hearing had to be converted into a case conference as the appointed Child Representative wrote in to Court to inform that he was not able to prepare his report given that he had not been able to meet up with either the Father or C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the case conference, the former counsel for the Father informed the Court that the Father would be “overseas until next year to serve God’s purposes with his body and soul”. When I enquired as to where C1 was at that time, I was informed that the Father had refused to let his counsel communicate with the Court on that. Upon the Court’s insistence and direction, counsel for the Father subsequently informed that from what he knew, C1 should be in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that there was some concern as to C1’s care and living arrangements (based on the information given that the Father was overseas until next year) and his emotional state, I directed that C1 be produced in Court for counselling and check-in by our Court Family Specialist on 25 October 2024 (PM). I provided instructions that C1 may be accompanied to Court by one of his school teachers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 24 October 2024 (one day before C1 was to attend before the Court Family Specialist), the Mother turned up at the matrimonial home. Both the Father and C1 were present at the matrimonial home. There appeared to be an altercation between the Mother and C1, leading to alleged injuries to C1. Less than 2 weeks later, the Father filed this present application on 4 November 2024 seeking a PPO for all 3 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The present application </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Before this Court, the Father relied on seven (7) incidents to mount the case for a PPO on behalf of the children against the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> For ease of reference, I shall use the same headings as the Father in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) in listing out the 7 incidents: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Threatened family with a knife on 3 May 2020;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Removal and restraint of the children on 23 May 2021;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     No medical attention provided to sick children on 18 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Self-harm and assault on 20 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Breaking and entering on 22 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Removal of C2 and C3 on 8 March 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Violence against C1 on 24 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father has two witnesses, being his mother, Madam [T] and C1.

The then section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) states that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.-(1</b>)    The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Both limbs of section 65 must be satisfied before the Court will grant a PPO:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The person against whom the PPO application is made has <em>committed or is likely to commit</em> family violence; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is <em>necessary for the PPO to be granted</em> for the protection of the person seeking protection or the person on whose behalf the protection is sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Under the then section 64 of the WC, “family violence” was defined as:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     While the standard of proof to be applied is one of the civil standard in the PPO proceedings, the High Court in the case of <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> had emphasized (at [28]) that it is important to recognise that the protection conferred by a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions and that in light of the criminal consequences that follow a breach of a PPO, ordering one is not a decision a court would take lightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">First incident - Threatened family with a knife on 3 May 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first incident was alleged to have occurred on 3 May 2020. The Father gave evidence that the children and he were at their flat with the Mother and the domestic helper. It appeared to the Father that the Mother was upset over matters at work and she was crying. The Mother started screaming and all of a sudden, she retrieved a knife from the kitchen. The Father told the children to quickly go into the room with the domestic helper and lock the door. According to the Father, the Mother brandished the knife and said that she wanted to “end” everyone in the family and “end everything”; he understood her to mean that she wanted to kill everyone in the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> While the children were in the room, the Father believed they heard the commotion outside. As the Father was trying to calm the Mother down, she verbalized that she was still young and should not be married or have children. The Mother calmed down and relinquished the knife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     According to the Father, when he checked on the children later, they were quiet and subdued. He also spoke to the Mother later that night and advised her to quit her job. The following day, the Father received a text message from the Mother asking him whether he knew why she took a knife. The Father mentioned that he did not know how to respond to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     C1 was 10 years old at the time this alleged incident happened. He testified under cross-examination that he did not remember the reason why the Mother held the knife but he did remember that she was very angry with him when he exited his room on that day. She then went to the kitchen, took a knife and then started threatening him. His father came in to protect him. As he was really scared, he took his siblings and brought them into the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> They were not aware of what was happening. He was, however, scared and could not think straight. He sat down, covered his ears and closed his eyes. Sometime later, he opened the bedroom door and peeked; he saw that his parents were still arguing and the Mother was still holding onto the knife. It was only sometime later that the Mother calmed down and they were able to leave the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother denied the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While at first glance, the testimonies of the Father and C1 appear to corroborate, there are some inconsistencies which make it difficult to make a finding on the reason why the Mother had picked up the knife. If the Mother was upset over work matters and wanted to “end everything”, as the Father had said, it would be odd for the Mother to be targeting C1. According to C1, the Mother was very angry with him, went to the kitchen, took a knife and threatened him. While I accept that the Mother was clearly upset over something and did pick up a knife, given the inconsistencies, I am unable to find that she had threatened C1 with it or that she had threatened to “end everything”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On balance, I am of the view that the Father had not proven specifically that there was family violence committed against the children. Furthermore, while the parents were arguing, the children were away from them and in a room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For completeness, I should add that even if he had so proven, I note that since 3 May 2020, the Mother remains the primary caregiver of C2 and C3 to date without any allegations of the Mother threatening to harm them. There was also a period of mutual access to the children by the Parties following the interim care and control orders made in July 2022. Unless this Court finds that the other alleged incidents disclose family violence, the Father would not have satisfied the “necessity” limb based on this incident alone. I turn now to the rest of the incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Second incident - Removal and restraint of the children on 23 May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Much was said by both Parties on the events surrounding 23 May 2021; the Mother was also cross-examined by counsel for the Father on these events and at various points, she refused to answer his questions. I informed her that I would record her as refusing to answer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is clear from the background facts and the testimonies that 23 May 2021 was the date that the Mother had intended to leave the matrimonial home with the children. The Father had received a call from his mother, Madam [T] informing him that the Mother had called and informed her that she would be taking all the children away. According to the Father, he rushed back from work to find his home “ransacked” and his safe open. Although he enlisted the help of the police, the children could not be located until the end of the June holidays when they were back in their school and kindergarten respectively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     According to C1, on 23 May 2021, he was taken away from the matrimonial home by a male adult and a female adult whom he recognised as from his father’s office. They told him that he was to attend a special enrichment class. He was brought to a HDB flat at an unknown location. There was another male adult in the flat, known to him as [S]. He was made to play board games, and he realised that there was no enrichment class.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When C1 saw his mother at this flat subsequently, he was told by her that he could not go back home to see his father. He tried to run out of the flat but was prevented to leave by the Mother who was grabbing his right wrist. The Mother then dragged him into the car and drove him to another HDB flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. When he was forced inside the flat, he saw that C2 and C3 were inside with their domestic helper. When he tried to run out of the flat, the Mother grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him into a room. She confined him inside and he started crying until he was tired and fell asleep.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     According to him, he and his siblings were in that flat for about a month. He was scared and did not know what the Mother would do to him or his siblings. The Mother also told him that if he tried to run away, she would call the police, and he would be in serious trouble. He recalled two occasions when his siblings wanted to go home and would be hit by the Mother; the first was when he saw both of them having red marks on their arms in the flat and the second was when he saw C2 being slapped on the face at a shopping mall. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother denied confining the children in her rental flat and produced photographs of the 3 children during the relevant period, showing that she had brought the children to various shopping centres and playgrounds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She also produced some messages between herself and [S] for the period from 22 May to 25 May 2021 as a contemporaneous record of the children’s reactions when she left the matrimonial home with them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I do believe that the Mother had planned to leave the matrimonial home with the 3 children on 23 May 2021 and enlisted her friends’ help to do so. C1, being the eldest and therefore with greater understanding of his circumstances, was resistant to the idea, although the Mother had hoped that he would settle down soon to a new life with her (as seen from her text messages with [S]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Given the above context, I find it hard to find that there was any family violence committed by the Mother against the children. While the Father had, through his counsel, emphasised the deceptive manner in which the Mother had sought to take C1 away from the matrimonial home, and her evasiveness on this point during cross-examination, this does not lead to the conclusion that the Mother had committed family violence against the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In finding that there was no family violence, the Court is not necessarily condoning the acts of the Mother in taking the children away, especially C1 from the matrimonial home in the manner that she had. I agree with the words of counsel for the Father that children are often at the mercy of the warring parents and that their distress and objection towards relocation are often ignored or subordinate to the desires of the parents relocating them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, the remedy, when faced with a situation of a spouse leaving the matrimonial home with the children, ought to lie in the sphere of the Family Court making orders on custody, care and control over the children. Just as the Mother had taken the children away from the matrimonial home on 23 May 2021 without the Father’s consent, the Father had taken C1 away from the school on 9 July 2021 without the Mother’s consent. Both Parties filed their own interim care and control applications in this regard and orders had already been granted since July 2022, which should regulate the Parties’ affairs and arrangements in relation to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As for the allegations by C1 that the Mother had confined and hit them whenever they wanted to return to the matrimonial home, given the contemporaneous text messages and the photographs that the Mother had produced, I am of the view that C1 had exaggerated his evidence and the extent to which the Mother had tried to prevent him or his siblings from leaving the rental flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Counsel for the Wife submitted that the evidence of C1 should be treated with caution<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, relying on the case of <em>Lee Kwang Peng v PP</em> [1997] 3 SLR 278 in which Yong Pung How CJ stated (at [62]):-</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…[I]t is well-established rule of practice in our law that where evidence is given by a child witness, that evidence is not to be accepted at face value without some measure of corroboration: see <em>Goh Liong Lam &amp; Ors</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33605-M.xml')\">[1958] MLJ 254</a>, Chao Chong &amp; Ors v PP <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33773-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 238</a> and <em>Ng Kwee Piow v R</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33909-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 278</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having heard C1 on the stand (through the video-conferencing facilities) and scrutinised his evidence with particular care, I agree with counsel’s submissions that C1 appeared influenced by the acrimonious relationship between his parents and are aligned with the Father’s views that a PPO should be granted. Through C1’s testimony, it would seem that he harboured the wrong impression that if the Court granted the PPO, this would mean that he and his siblings would get to stay with the Father; this would then teach the Mother the importance of having a family and hopefully make her change since she would get to feel what it was like not to have a family and be lonely.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that C1 would have come to these views on his own without being influenced to some degree by the Father. Both the Father and C1 had expressed their hopes for the Mother to return home with C2 and C3 and for the family to be together again. That being the case, I am of the view that the Court cannot rely on C1’s evidence alone to find that the Mother had committed family violence against all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I am also not convinced that C1’s testimony is corroborated by either the police report or the medical discharge summary dated 4 August 2021. The police report was filed by C1, on the advice of the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, on 25 March 2024, nearly 3 years after the Mother left the matrimonial home with the children. As for the medical discharge summary, it merely stated “Neck pain today”, which does not prove that the Mother had caused the “neck pain”, much less a “recurring” neck pain, as alleged by the Father. C1 also did <u>not</u> mention about any recurring neck pains in his AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Third incident - No medical attention provided to sick children on 18 February 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Although the Father had listed this incident in his AEIC seemingly as a failure to provide medical attention to the sick children on 18 February 2024, it would appear that his real complaint was against the Mother allegedly making a false report against him, thereby causing the police to turn up the matrimonial home and frightening the children in the process. This only became clear in the Father’s written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to the Father, he had access to C2 and C3 on 18 February 2024 and brought them back to the matrimonial home. Upon reaching home, he discovered that they were running a fever. The children also complained of a sore throat. C2 informed him that they were sick since 14 February 2024 but the Mother did not bring them to the doctor. He brought them to see a doctor and they were prescribed medication and given six (6) days of medical leave.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     According to the Father, he had contacted the Mother and told her of the illness and medical attention but she did not respond to him. He was subsequently contacted by the police and informed that the Mother had made a police report against him, alleging that he had hurt the children. He gave evidence that later that night, about 4 to 5 police officers with “riot shields and what looked like torch lights entered [his] house and [their] bedroom, frightening the children by their sudden appearance”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It was submitted by the Father that the appearance of a team of police officers in full gear was shocking and frightening for the Children. The police officers spoke to C2 and she appeared afraid during the interaction while maintaining that she did not want to go with the Mother as the Mother was always angry and that she wanted to stay in the matrimonial home. It was further submitted that the Mother’s misconstruing the Father’s action was plainly with the intention of inducing the police to intervene and the Mother would have known that such action taken by the police would, if witnessed by the children, cause them some fear.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Given the heading as found in the Father’s AEIC, it was not surprising that the focus of the Mother was to explain that she was aware that C2 and C3 were having a cough and how she was managing their symptoms. The Mother stated that before the Father took access of C2 and C3, she had already informed him they were having a cough and gave him some instructions on the kinds of food that they should abstain from. The Mother further stated that the Father failed to return the two children that day and that he kept them with him for nearly 3 weeks. He also did not present her with the Antigen Rapid Tests upon her request.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It was not put to the Mother that she had made a false report to the police. Given that this is a serious allegation, and she was not put on notice that this was the Father’s case against her, I am of the view that this incident cannot be used against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In any event, the “limb” that the Father appeared to be relying on is (d), that being “causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member”. Even if the Father can prove that the Mother had made a false report to the police, it is quite the leap of logic to say that she had made it with the intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the children. In fact, it was the Mother who appeared to be in some anguish herself. The Father was supposed to have returned C2 and C3 to her by 6.45 p.m. that day. The several missed calls and the text messages to the Father asking where C2 and C3 were<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> suggested that the Mother was desperate to know their whereabouts. She also stated in a text message to the Father the next day that she was “so worried about [her] children as [he] was supposed to return them to [her] by 6.45 p.m.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fourth incident - Self-harm and assault on 20 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fifth incident - Breaking and entering on 22 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Sixth incident - Removal of C2 and C3 on 8 March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I shall deal with the above incidents together as they fall within the same period during which the Father had kept C2 and C3 following his failure to return them to the Mother on 18 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43      <u>Fourth incident</u>: The Father’s case was that the Mother had come to the matrimonial home with two of her friends on this date. He was in the bedroom and heard C2 shouting that “Mama is here! Mama is here!”. When he came out to the living room, he saw that the Mother was holding onto C2’s left hand in a bid to get her to leave the flat. He instructed C2 to take C3 to the bedroom and locked the door. He then proceeded to call the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     According to him, the Mother seemed enraged at this point and started shouting at her. She then suddenly turned to the wall and slammed her forehead onto the wall. The Mother tried to reach the door of the room when C2 and C3 were in. The Father stood in her way; she started to grab the phone which he was using to film and his neck and also used her knee to hit his torso area. The Father stood in the doorway to prevent her from reaching the door. The Mother continued to strangle him and used her elbows and knees to hit his torso area multiple times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     When the police came, C2 and C3 were ushered out of the room. C2 told the police that “Mama came and pulled my hand away.” By her words and expression, the Father felt that the Mother’s actions caused hurt and fear to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46      <u>Fifth incident</u>: Madam [T] testified that she was at home when the Mother came with the locksmith. The Mother told her that she wanted to take the children away and tried to advance to the room but Madam [T] responded that she could not let the Mother take the children away without the Father’s consent. The police arrived shortly and when they asked C2 and C3 whether they would like to follow the Mother, they said ‘no’. The police then instructed the Mother to leave the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     C1 gave a similar account; he was afraid that the Mother would take him and siblings away so he quickly told C2 and C3 to go to their room and lock the door. The Mother was shouting at his grandmother and he told the Mother not to scold the latter. C1 pleaded with the Mother to leave them alone and not harm them. He also told the Mother to come back home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48      <u>Sixth incident</u>: On 8 March 2024, both C2 and C3 were picked up by the Mother from their respective schools before the time of dismissal. According to the Father, the Mother had told the respective schools that the children were being picked up for a doctor’s or medical appointment. The Father made a police report. He had no information on C2 and C3 until the school reopened on 18 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     To reiterate, the Father was supposed to have returned C2 and C3 to the Mother by 6.45 p.m. on 18 February 2024. She had called the Father several times to ask where the two children were. It was clear that by all accounts, the Mother had come to the matrimonial flat on 20 and 22 February 2024 in an attempt to have C2 and C3 returned to her. She could not therefore be said then to be harassing the children with the intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause them anguish. It was also unlikely that the children were placed in fear of hurt to themselves due to the Mother’s actions in turning up at the flat, though it could be emotionally distressing to them at that time. In fact, for the incident on 22 February 2024, what C1 was truly afraid of (as gleaned from his AEIC) was that the Mother wanted to take them away, leading him to quickly tell C2 and C3 to go into the room and lock the door. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Even though he also then stated that he tried to talk to the Mother and pleaded with her to leave them alone and not to harm them, he also told the Mother to “come back home”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As for the alleged removal of C2 and C3 from their school, given that the Mother has interim care and control over them, I fail to see how this can be family violence perpetuated by the Mother against them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, I should mention that the Father had stated in his AEIC (at [9]):-</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Sometime in April 2021, the Respondent decided that she wanted to leave the family and she moved out of the Flat, leaving the Children in my care. Thereafter, the Respondent filed for divorce sometime in August 2021. Despite her leaving the Flat, I ensured that she continued to have reasonable access to the children as I believe the Children needed to have a relationship with the Respondent. However, despite having access to the Children, she repeatedly returned to the Flat, often announced and her conduct during these occasions would turn aggressive and violent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Although the Father tried to paint a picture of the Mother leaving the children under his care and of her coming unannounced to the matrimonial home and turning aggressive and violent, it is clear that this was not anywhere near the truth. She did not leave the children under the Father’s care. From the time that she left the matrimonial home, C2 and C3 had been living with her, save for nearly 3 weeks in February/March 2024 during which the Father kept them after access on 18 February 2024. As for C1, the Mother did not leave him with the Father. It was the Father who came and took C1 from his school in July 2021; C1 continued to stay with the Father to date since then. Further, the Mother had turned up unannounced at the matrimonial home during the period when the Father had kept C2 and C3 with him after his access, with the obvious reason of attempting to have C2 and C3 returned to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Seventh incident - Violence against C1 on 24 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     These are the facts which are <u>not</u> in dispute between the Parties: On 24 October 2024, as the Father and C1 were about to leave the matrimonial home, they found the Mother with a friend known also to the Father, [S] standing at the corridor leading to the lift lobby. The Mother was surprised to see the Father, having heard from her counsel that the Father was supposedly overseas. She took out her phone to start taking pictures of the Father as evidence that he had lied to the Court that he had gone overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     When C1 saw that the Mother was taking pictures, he came forward to either cover her camera phone or grab her phone. A struggle ensued between them, with the Mother trying to prevent her phone from being grabbed and C1 holding onto the Mother’s phone. The Father immediately took out his phone to record the incident; the video recording was submitted to Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     These are the facts that are in dispute: According to the Father, the Mother’s phone flew from her grasp in the midst of the struggle. The Mother appeared angry with C1 for this and pulled and twisted his right arm. C1 turned away from the Mother by bending slightly at his waist, and it seemed to the Father that C1 was trying to remove himself from her grasp. The Father then alleged that he saw the Mother raise her left hand and hit C1 on the back of his neck. The Father tried to block the Mother from hitting C1 further. C1 then turned around and held onto the Mother’s arms, pulling them to his waist to stop her from hitting him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother denied hitting C1. The Mother testified that she wanted to take pictures of the Father to present to the Court and that she was trying to protect and hold onto her phone. She explained that she had gone to the matrimonial home as she was worried that the Father “might take [C1] out of Singapore as he himself was supposed to be not in Singapore”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Upon seeing the Father, she took a picture of him using her phone because she needed to show the Court that the Father had lied to the Court that he was not in Singapore and did not comply with the Court’s directions to have C1 interviewed by the Child Representative.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The video recording showing the struggle between the Mother and C1 and submitted to Court was about 30 seconds in length. It shows the Mother and C1 in a “tight lock” with both trying very hard to hold onto the Mother’s phone. It does <b><u>not</u></b> show the Mother hitting C1 at the back of the neck. In any event, given the background and the context, I am again hard pressed to find that there has been family violence committed by the Mother against C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In <em>AWR v AWS</em> [2011] SDGC 410, the Court found that there was family violence when the respondent snatched away the complainant’s two phones with which she had wanted to call the police and put her in fear of her own safety. In <em>AGX v AGW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGDC 0271.xml')\">[2010] SGDC 271</a>, the Court also found that there was family violence when the respondent followed the complainant and forcibly obtained her phone, when the latter refused to yield it. This case is distinguishable from the abovementioned cases as C1 was the one who approached the Mother and tried to cover her phone camera as well as grab her phone away. In the ensuing struggle, the phone did fly out of the Mother’s hand and landed on a nearby ledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Counsel for the Wife submitted that throughout the struggle, C1 was the aggressor instead.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> While not going so far as to call C1 the aggressor, I am inclined to agree that the entire struggle was initiated and caused by C1. That being the case, I take the view that he is no victim of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Father’s PPO application is dismissed. None of the incidents relied upon by the Father justified the granting of a PPO in favour of the children, especially C2 and C3. Given C1’s testimony, it would also appear that both the Father and C1 have a misconceived notion as to what the PPO (if granted) is intended to achieve for them. The Mother is represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. I am of the view that it will be just in the circumstances for the Father to pay costs to the Director of Legal Aid. I shall hear counsel on the quantum of costs before making the order.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The orders were inadvertently left out in the extracted Order of Court; however, it is clear from the access orders that the interim care and control of C2 and C3 is with the Mother, while the Father has interim care and control of C1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Father alleged 8 different incidents in his AEIC.

District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff (“<b>Wife</b>”) and Defendant (“<b>Husband</b>”) are Indian nationals in their mid-40s. They were married in January 2005. In 2011, they came to Singapore, have two children, and became permanent residents. On 21 December 2022, their 17-year marriage ended with the grant of an interim judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Regarding the ancillary matters, the parties <em>agree</em> to the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That they shall have joint custody of the children, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That there shall be no order as to spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties cannot agree on the rest of the ancillary matters. These matters came before me for a determination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children – Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the issue of the care and control of the children. The parties have –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A daughter of about 11.5 years old (D.O.B. XX December 2013).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A son of about 6 years old (D.O.B. XX April 2019).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       By way of background, the situation regarding the children’s care and control at the time of the hearing is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In June 2022, the Wife left the matrimonial home (in the Bayshore area) with the children for India. They returned to Singapore in July 2022. Since then, they have been staying in the Pasir Ris area.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In October 2022, the Wife applied for – and obtained – interim care and control of the children. The Husband was allowed to have weekly <em>supervised</em> access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In February 2023, pursuant to his appeal and by consent, the Husband was given <em>unsupervised</em> access to the children (i) every Sunday and (ii) on weekday(s) to be agreed between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In May 2023, the parties were informed that a custody evaluation report (“<b>CER</b>”) had recommended that they be granted joint custody as well as <em>“joint care and control”</em> of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In June 2023, the Wife sought a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) to protect the Daughter from the Husband: SS 1003/xxxx (“<b>SS 1003</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In December 2023, pursuant to his application, the Husband was granted interim care and control of the children every Sunday (from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm), while the Wife was granted interim care and control of them for the rest of the week: FC/ORC 5379/xxxx (“<b>ORC 5379</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In June 2024, the Wife withdrew SS 1003.

Each parent will be responsible for the day-to-day decision-making for the children when the children are living with him or her. The children will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers under such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In assessing whether a shared care and control arrangement is appropriate, the paramount consideration is the child’s interests. The factors relevant to this consideration include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether there is allegation of family violence against the child by the parent(s)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For obvious reasons, where a parent has committed, or is alleged to have committed, family violence against his/her child, it is generally not appropriate for that parent to have shared care and control of the child. For clarity, the mere fact that one parent has a PPO against the <em>other parent</em> does not preclude a shared care and control order from being made: <em>WEM v WEN</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 247 (“<b><em>WEM</em></b>”) at [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether both parents are equally committed to care for the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Another relevant factor is whether both parents are equally committed to care for the child. In assessing this factor, courts typically consider, for instance, whether they –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       are responsible parents,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       have been/are involved in the child’s care and development, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       have taken an active interest in the child’s life and place the child’s needs before their own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>See e.g., <em>UGQ v UGR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20965-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 125</a> (“<b><em>UGQ</em></b>”) at [39] and [41]; <em>WXA</em> at [10]; <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [62]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> at [18]; <em>VJJ v VJK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24683-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 57</a> (“<b><em>VJJ</em></b>”) at [37]; <em>WEM</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the parents are able to care for the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The extent to which the parents can care for the child is also a factor in assessing whether a shared care and control arrangement is suitable. Considerations that are relevant to this factor include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where a parent is a foreigner, can that parent remain in Singapore? If the answer is no, then courts have ordered sole care and control to the parent who can remain in Singapore: see e.g., <em>XII v XIJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33107-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 40</a> at [32] and [88].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       How will the parents juggle their work and other commitments with that of caring for the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       To be clear, the mere fact that one parent is employed full-time (Parent A) while the other parent is employed as a freelancer is not a basis for denying Parent A the benefits of shared care and control of the child. This is because “[f]ull-time employment is an ordinary part of daily life”. The more critical inquiry is whether Parent A makes time for the child: <em>XFF v XFG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32460-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 45</a> (“<b><em>XFF</em></b>”) at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       In <em>UPK v UPL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22321-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 92</a> (“<b><em>UPK</em></b>”), the court ordered shared care and control of a two-year-old child because, among others, the father <em>had a helper and his parents to help care for the child</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_3\"></a>(3)       In <em>XIC v XID</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32841-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 14</a> (“<b><em>XIC</em></b>”) at [9], the court denied the father’s request for shared care and control of his two primary school going children because he could not show how he would be able to care for them when (1) he had two toddlers with his new partner and (2) both his partner and him were working full-time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the parents can cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Another factor is the degree to which the parents can cooperate with each other within an arrangement of shared care and control: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<b><em>TAU</em></b>”) at [12]; <em>WXA</em> at [9]; <em>VSF v VSG</em> [2022] SGFC (“<b><em>VSF</em></b>”) at [19] and [20]. This factor is relevant because for such an arrangement to work properly, the parents must be able to (i) discuss and agree on the child’s daily activities and (ii) ensure that the child’s daily life is seamless even when he/she switches homes: <em>XHY v XHZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32820-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 13</a> at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     At this juncture, a few points bear highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the mere fact that the parents reside together – even after interim judgment is ordered – is not conclusive evidence that they can cooperate with each other within an arrangement of shared care and control: see <em>XCQ</em> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, as rightly noted in <em>XFF</em> at [6] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Although acrimony between parents is one factor that should be accounted for when considering a shared care and control arrangement, it does not automatically nullify such an option. The court has to take a close look at the facts of each case to see if a shared care and control arrangement would be unworkable because of the acrimony, and if it would be in the best interests of the children. Otherwise, parties may have a perverse incentive to increase the acrimony to gain a tactical advantage in the care arrangements of the children (<em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20688-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 213</a> at [73], [76]-[77] citing <em>AZZ v BZZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Thus, a shared care and control arrangement has been ordered in cases even where –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       The parties’ relationship <em>with each other</em> is acrimonious: see e.g., <em>CXR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a> at [18] and [19]; <em>VJJ</em> at [27], [35] and [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       The parties disagree on the appropriate orders to be made for the child: see e.g., <em>VJJ</em> at [46]; <em>WEM</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_3\"></a>(3)       The parties have different parenting styles – as such differences, which arise due to differences in each parent’s personality, can often be addressed with appropriate counselling orders: see e.g., <em>WEM</em> at [40] and [42]; <em>VSF</em> at [22], [23] and [29]; <em>VJJ</em> at [25] and [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Third</em>, the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests: <em>CX v CY</em> [2005] SLR (R) 690 at [28]. This includes an expectation that a parent will support the child’s relationship with the other parent: <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> (“<b><em>WAH</em></b>”) at [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_v\"></a>(v)        <em>Finally</em>, a shared care and control arrangement will not be appropriate if the parents are <em>clearly</em> unable to even communicate with each other and compromise in making day-to-day decisions for the child: <em>XJI v XJJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32924-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 17</a> at [5]; <em>XCQ v XCP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33149-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 26</a> (“<b><em>XCQ</em></b>”) at [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether there has been attempts to alienate the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Another relevant factor is whether one parent has attempted to alienate the child against the other parent. If a parent has, for instance, –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       sought to remove the other parent from the child’s life: see e.g., <em>UGQ</em> at [43] to [46],</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “methodically involved [the child] in the dispute between the [parents]”: see e.g., <em>VJJ</em> at [27], [28] and [48], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       restricted the other parent’s access to the child: <em>WAH</em> at [46],</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>then an order of shared care and control may be appropriate to prevent further alienation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether a shared care and control arrangement is likely to harm the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     A shared care and control arrangement will often introduce uncertainties and disruptions into the child’s routines: <em>XFF</em> at [9]. It is important to assess the impact of such uncertainties and disruptions, and whether it will be easy for the child to live in two homes. (For instance, what is the distance that the child will need to travel between the two homes and his/her school?) This, in turn, requires a consideration of (i) the child’s age, (ii) the child’s level of maturity and independence, and (iii) the child’s needs at that stage of life. See e.g., <em>TAU</em> at [12]; <em>WXA</em> at [9]; <em>XHS v XHT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32881-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 20</a>; <em>XCP v XCQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32627-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 107</a> at [38]; <em>XFF</em> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Accordingly, a shared care and control arrangement may be appropriate if, for instance, the child (i) is adaptable to changes and (ii) will not experience significant psychological resistance if he/she is required to live with both parents on an alternating basis: <em>WEM</em> at [41]. It has been observed that a young child who has yet to commence formal education may be more suited to a shared care and control arrangement: <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [109]; <em>UPK</em> at [26]. On this note, such an arrangement has been ordered for children as young as <em>two</em> years old: see e.g., <em>WEM</em>; <em>UPK</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On the other hand, a shared care and control arrangement may not be appropriate if the uncertainties and disruptions to the child’s routines are likely to be significant. See for instance the following cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In <em>XGE v XGF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32684-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 109</a> (“<b><em>XGE</em></b>”), the court dismissed the father’s request for an order of shared care and control for his four-year-old daughter. In coming to this decision, the court noted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_1\"></a>(1)       The mother had been the child’s primary caregiver since birth. The father had lived with the daughter only until she was about 10 months old. Thereafter, he visited the mother and daughter often until the latter was about two years’ old. From then on, the visits became rare because the father’s and mother’s relationship had broken down: <em>XGE</em> at [8], [10] to [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_2\"></a>(2)       The father’s proposal was for the daughter to live in two different households every three to four days. This would be too disruptive for her: <em>XGE</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_3\"></a>(3)       The father had come from a traditional Chinese patriarchal family. The differences in the father’s and mother’s values and approaches to parenting were very severe and was a reason for the breakdown in their marriage. These differences would cause the daughter to suffer “a sense of dislocation” if a shared care and control order was made: <em>XGE</em> at [8] and [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In <em>XIC</em> at [9], the court declined to grant a shared care and control order because the two children (nine years old and seven years old) –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       had been living with their mother for the past 5 years, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       did not have any overnight access with their father since he left the home when they were only three years old and one year old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_j\"></a>(j)     For completeness, the mere fact that a child shares a <em>closer bond with one parent</em> is not a bar to a shared care and control arrangement. This is especially so when the reason for such a bond is because that parent had unilaterally removed the child from the matrimonial home: <em>WEM</em> at [48].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Sole care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     If a shared care and control arrangement is assessed to be inappropriate, then a court will have to determine which parent should be granted sole care and control of the child. On this issue, the relevant considerations have been discussed in detail in <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [14] to [16]. To summarise, they include the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>The parents’ past and present interactions with the child</em>. For instance, which parent (i) has been showing greater concern, interest and responsibility for the child, (ii) has been his/her primary caregiver, (iii) has a stronger bond with the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>The parents’ future caregiving arrangements</em>. For instance, which parent (i) can provide better care for the child, (ii) can provide him/her a more secure and stable home environment, and (iii) is more willing to promote a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent? It is also important to consider the child’s wishes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Adverse considerations</em>. For instance, does any of the parent have an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook which may affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child? Has any of the parent acted in a way to intentionally or knowingly harm the child’s interest?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Other considerations.</em> Finally, continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being. Siblings should generally not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">CER’s recommendation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In assessing which option – a shared care and control order <em>or</em> a sole care and control order – better serves the child’s interests, a judicial interview with the child and/or a CER can be useful: <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<b><em>WKM</em></b>”) at [34], [60], [62] to [64], [67], [68], [72] and [74].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This brings me to the CER’s recommendation in the present case – i.e., that the parties be granted “<em>joint</em> care and control” of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     What weight should be given to this recommendation? The parties took polar positions on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Husband, the recommendation should be accepted because there was no material change in circumstances to suggest that it was unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife disagreed. After the CER’s recommendation was disclosed to the parties (in May 2023), a PPO application was filed (in June 2023). The application alleged that the Husband had committed family violence on the Daughter from September 2022 to 28 May 2023. The maker of the CER would not have known of such violence, especially those committed around May 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering the matter, I declined to rely on the CER’s recommendation as a basis for deciding on the issue of care and control of the children. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <em>First</em>, I accept the Wife’s submission that the maker of the CER would not have known of the family violence allegedly committed by the Husband – especially those committed around May 2023. It is unclear whether the maker will still recommend “joint care and control” for the children if such information had been made to him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, the CER’s recommendation is somewhat dated. It was made about two years before the hearing. In view of this, I called on the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“<b>DSSA</b>”) which was working with the parties and the children to provide an update on the family situation. The update did not touch on the PPO application. It did however state the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Daughter continued to have struggles with how to perceive the Husband’s communications,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     She was not yet comfortable to meet him more regularly at his home, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     (On a more positive note) the father-daughter relationship was improving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether shared care and control is appropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I will now apply the considerations in [8] and [9] above to the present case. My analysis is as follows.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"6.48%\"><col width=\"27.72%\"><col width=\"65.8%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Factors</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Considerations</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(1)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whether there is allegation of family violence against the children by the parent(s)?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes, there was a PPO application against the Husband for having committed family violence against the Daughter.

According to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties would have discharged roughly <em>equal</em> indirect <em>non-</em>financial contributions during the marriage given that the domestic helpers had assisted with the domestic chores, and the Husband’s parents had assisted to supervise the helpers and to look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s financial contributions had allowed the Wife and children to enjoy a high quality of life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Given the above, the Husband submitted that the apportionment of the indirect contributions should be in the ratio of 30 (Wife) to 70 (Husband) because he had made significantly more indirect <em>financial</em> contributions which improved the quality of the family’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having set out the parties’ position, I will now state my findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Regarding the parties’ direct contributions, I note that the difference between the Husband’s computation ([34(a)(i)]) and the Wife’s computation ([34(b)(ii)]) is <em>negligible</em> – a mere difference of 2.41%.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Adopting a broadbrush approach, I apportion the parties’ direct contributions at <b>25% (Wife)</b> and <b>75% (Husband)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions – Husband’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Next, I turn to the indirect contributions. The Husband had submitted that “<em>more emphasis</em> should be placed on indirect <em>financial</em> contributions, rather than indirect <em>non</em>-financial contributions”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I am unable to accept this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband’s approach gives <em>undue</em> emphasis to indirect financial contributions over indirect non-financial contributions. Not all indirect contributions can be measured in dollars and cents. This does not however mean that such contributions are any less significant. Take, for instance, the fact that the Wife had gone through IVF procedures. I find the Husband’s submissions – (i) that “undue focus” should not be given to this “<em>minutiae</em> of family life” and (ii) that he had supported the Wife in the IVF procedures <em>by paying for them</em> – to be insensitive and unfairly diminish the side-effects and sacrifices that she had to go through to produce two children for the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, while it is undeniable that the Husband’s financial contributions had allowed the Wife and children to enjoy a high quality of life, I have serious doubts regarding his claim that he had paid “over 90%” of the family expenses. The Husband had failed to provide any proof for such an arbitrary claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the mere fact that the Husband earns a higher income than the Wife does not mean that her financial contributions towards the family are insignificant. In this regard, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband did not disprove the Wife’s evidence that she had paid for some of the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Given that her income is significant ($9,782/month), it is plausible that the Wife could have made substantial financial contributions towards the household and other expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       This is especially so when the Husband has significantly (about five times) more matrimonial assets in his sole name than the Wife: see [23(b)] and [23(c)]. This suggests that the Husband would have channeled a significant portion of his income into savings and investments – and not just for paying all the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     There is another aspect of the Husband’s case that I have difficulty accepting. This relates to his submission that the parties would have discharged roughly <em>equal</em> indirect <em>non-</em>financial contributions during the marriage: see [38(a)] above. I am unable to see how this could have been the case given that <em>between the two of them</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife is the primary caregiver for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife probably played a larger role in managing the household. The Husband is the Executive Director of a large local bank<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> whereas the Wife works as a senior software developer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Comparing the nature of their respective job, the Husband would likely be spending more time on his work than the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife was “more relaxed” about her career prospects. According to the Husband, this was because he had a stable career. This is consistent with the Wife’s evidence that she had sacrificed her career development to focus on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions – Assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Based on the evidence, it appears that the parties had made contributions in their own way to ensure the well-being of the family – the Husband by providing financial stability, and the Wife by focusing on managing the children and the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Taking a holistic view of the factors in [37], [42], and [43] above, I find that the Wife and Husband had made <em>equal</em> indirect contributions to the family. Accordingly, I apportion their respective share of indirect contributions as <b>50% (Wife)</b> and <b>50% (Husband)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Ratio for division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Considering both their direct and indirect contributions, I find that the matrimonial assets should be divided in the ratio of <b>37.5 (Wife) and 62.5

As such, the applicant has to show that he/she needs maintenance from the date prior to the application for maintenance or ancillary hearing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Second, the applicant should give reason(s) for the delay in seeking maintenance for the child/children. Not making interim maintenance to save costs is a good reason in explaining the delay (<em>TG v TH</em> (see above: [14]) at [43]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Third, income and expenses of the parties in the past (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> (see above: [16]) at [12(b)]) and whether circumstances have changed since;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Fifth, potential savings in costs, time and resources in having maintenance for children dealt with in the ancillary hearing, instead of having a separate hearing for interim maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    Sixth, the detriment caused to the parent in default if backdated maintenance is ordered (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> (see above: [16]) at [12(c)]-[12(d)]). It is not difficult to appreciate why this might be the case. On the backdating of an order, the payer is instantly in arrears in respect of the payments due prior to the claim for maintenance. The payer might not have the means to pay, or if he does, at the cost of hardship to himself;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Seventh, an order for maintenance is an order of court. If the parent in default does not pay, he/she potentially faces committal proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(h)    Eighth, difficulties or hardship that the applicant faced in trying to meet expenses prior to the claim for maintenance. These were alluded to by Kan Ting Chiu J in the High Court case of <em>AJE v AJF</em> (see above: [16]), who there described an extreme situation of hardship (see above: [16]) (at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">If the [applicant] had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But in some situations, the applicant faces no hardship. The applicant might have in fact been maintained the child with income from other sources beside his/her own. This was the concern Kan J expressed in <em>AJE v AJF</em> (at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">[I]f the [payee] had been able to had been able to manage…, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for backdating would be weaker.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    Ninth, the length of the period for which maintenance for the child is claimed, and whether the applicant sought maintenance from the parent in default to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Applying the above principles, I declined to backdate the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the Daughter’s enrolment into an international school for academic year 2024 was in accordance with what the parties had planned for her. It would not be fair to expect the Husband to pay for the fees in such a school – especially when they involve a significant amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, enrolment in an international school is a good-to-have and not a must-have. There is no evidence that the Daughter would have been deprived of a proper education in Singapore by virtue of being enrolled in a local school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Before concluding, I note that the Husband has an outstanding costs order for $5,000 arising from HCF/DCA 125/2023 (heard on 22 April 2024). One year after it was made, this order remains unsatisfied. There is no confirmation as to when the Wife would satisfy the outstanding costs order. In the circumstances, pursuant to the Husband’s application, I order that the sum of $5,000 be deducted from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Finally, I make no order as to costs as this stage of the proceedings. If the parties wish to make costs submissions, they are to inform the court within two weeks of the date of this judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>_____________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>Annex A–1</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>MONTHLY EXPENSES – DAUGHTER [11.5 YEARS OLD]</b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"6.02%\"><col width=\"25.8%\"><col width=\"22.72%\"><col width=\"22.74%\"><col width=\"22.72%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expense item</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s computation ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>computation ($)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court’s decision ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Enrichment – </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Science – $400</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) Mathematics – $175</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) Gymnastics – $665</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(d) Tennis – $400</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(e) Swimming – $200 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,500</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Wife did not seek the Husband’s consent to enroll the child in these classes</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">575</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Items (a) and (b) are academic subjects.

This evidence has not been discredited.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_39_1\" id=\"Ftn_39\">[note: 39]</a></sup>The parties’ submissions regarding this item can be found in Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions dated 04.04.25 at [54] and [57(50)]; Defendant Father’s Written Submissions dated 25.02.25 at [72] to [77]. The Husband submitted that the Wife had dissipated the sums of $5,250 and $13,450. He relied on the presumption of dissipation (<em>UZM v UZN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> (“<b><em>UZM</em></b>”) at [67] and [68]) to support this submission. I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submission. For the presumption in <em>UZM</em> to be applicable, there must have been a disposal of (a) a significant amount of matrimonial asset (b) at a time when divorce is “imminent”. In <em>WQG v WQF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31045-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 13</a> at [2] and [3], the High Court declined to infer that a transaction that had occurred about two months before a divorce was intended to deplete the matrimonial pool. In the present case, the two sums of $5,250 and $13,450 are not significant. In any event, Husband had failed to show that at the time of their disposal, the divorce was “imminent”. I agree with the Wife that the Husband’s submission of dissipation is based on conjecture and fanciful. He had failed to prove his allegation.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_40_1\" id=\"Ftn_40\">[note: 40]</a></sup>I am mindful that there were certain brief periods when the Wife was not working.

They had their traditional marriage on 16 November 2016 in India and registered their marriage in India on 16 September 2019. Parties moved to Singapore in mid-2019. Their child was born in India on 21 June 2022 (the <b>“Child”</b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties’ marriage was fraught with difficulties leading to the Wife moving out of the parties’ rental flat together with the Child and commencing divorce proceedings in Singapore via Divorce Suit No. 5293 of 2023 (<b>“D 5293”</b>) on 2 November 2023. The Wife also filed the present maintenance proceedings for wife and child maintenance (<b>“MSS 1289”</b>) and an application for a personal protection order for herself via SS 1057 of 2024 (<b>“SS 1057”</b>) against the Husband on 4 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       For context, the Husband applied to stay D 5293 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> citing that India was the better forum. The Husband also commenced divorce proceedings in India. The Husband’s stay application was allowed by the learned Deputy Presiding Judge Chia Wee Kiat on 30 December 2024 and no appeal was filed by the Wife against the same. The parties’ divorce proceedings are on-going in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both parties acted in person. At the hearing of MSS 1289 and SS 1057 on 17 December 2024, the Husband orally applied to stay both proceedings on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. I heard the applications on 24 February 2025 and dismissed both applications. The Husband has filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision in respect of MSS 1289. I shall now set out my brief reasons for dismissing the Husband’s application to stay MSS 1289.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed by the parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties filed the following affidavits in respect of the stay application for MSS 1289:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Husband’s affidavit filed on 20 December 2024 (<b>“R1”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s affidavit filed on 30 December 2024 (<b>“C1”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Wife’s affidavit filed on 12 February 2025 (<b>“C2”</b>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Husband’s affidavit filed on 16 February 2025 (<b>“R2”</b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband’s case was set out in R1 and R2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In summary, the Husband’s case was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     India is the more appropriate forum for hearing the maintenance proceedings and ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Singapore court has found that India is the better forum to decide on the issues related to the divorce including the ancillary matters such as maintenance. The outcome of the stay application in D 5293 is binding on the MSS court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife can apply for interim maintenance in India immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Allowing MSS 1289 to proceed would be inconsistent with the outcome of the stay application in D 5293 that Singapore is not the appropriate forum to deal with the ancillary matters. Further, if the Singapore Court grants interim maintenance, it will interfere with the Indian divorce proceedings and complicate the overall financial adjudication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There are ongoing divorce proceedings in India and an application for interim maintenance can be made immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parties have never intended to permanently settle in Singapore. As such, given their temporary status, it would be inappropriate for the Singapore Court to assume jurisdiction over long-term matters such as spousal maintenance, which should be decided in India, which is their home country.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_g\"></a>(g)     There is no urgency for interim maintenance as the Wife has financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s case was set out in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In summary, the Wife’s case was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     R1 only addresses why the divorce proceedings should not continue in Singapore and does not address why MSS 1289 should not proceed in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties and the Child have no plans to relocate to India. The Wife has been staying in Singapore since November 2019 and now holds an employment pass on the basis of her employment. The Child is also studying in Singapore. The Husband has been working in the same office in Singapore for the past 4.5 years and has not indicated anywhere in his affidavit of his immediate intention to resign his job and go to India to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife and the Child’s monthly expenses are being incurred and will continue to be incurred in Singapore. It is therefore better that the Singapore Courts assess how much they should both be entitled to for maintenance from the Husband. Further, if the Husband fails to pay maintenance, the Wife can go to the Singapore courts for aid and assistance in enforcement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife will suffer severe prejudice if a stay is granted as the Indian Courts do require quite a number of hearings to be attended to in person. The Wife will have to travel to India with the Child and engage Indian lawyers to assist her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The applicable test to determine if a proceeding commenced in Singapore ought to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (the <b><em>“Spiliada </em></b><b>test”</b>). As such, the issues that I was to decide on as per the <em>Spiliada</em> test were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there was another available forum which was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to determine the dispute as per stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there was another available forum which was <em>prima facie</em> more appropriate than Singapore, whether there were any special circumstances existing to warrant the exercise of the Court’s discretion to refuse a stay as per stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In relation to the first issue, my finding was that Singapore is the most appropriate forum to determine the issue of interim maintenance. As such there was no need for me to go on to make to a finding on the second issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I set out my reasons for my findings on the first issue below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue: Whether Singapore was the most appropriate forum?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The <em>Spiliada</em> test is essentially a factors-based test: the weight to be placed on the various factors varies with each factual matrix. What may prove to be critical in one case might not be that important in another. However, as noted by the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> <b>(“</b><b><em>BDA</em></b><b>”</b>) at [24], residence appears to be an important factor:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Thus, where a defendant seeking a stay is working and residing in Singapore, there lies a greater evidential burden on him: the countervailing factors adduced in favour of the stay have to be correspondingly more convincing, in comparison to the hypothetical factual matrix, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, where the defendant is not resident in Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>BDA</em>, the parties were similarly Indian nationals and the wife had also made a s. 69 application for maintenance. The husband was resident in and employed in Singapore. The wife and the child were previously residing in Singapore but had left for India before the s. 69 application was filed. Parties were Singapore permanent residents. The husband commenced divorce proceedings in India shortly after the s. 69 application was filed. On appeal, the High Court dismissed the husband’s stay application. The Court noted, that the wife had instituted the maintenance application in Singapore, where the husband resided and worked. The Court also noted that the pending divorce proceedings instituted by the husband in India was not for the same relief as that claimed by the wife in her s. 69 maintenance application in Singapore. The former would result in the termination of the marriage, with the wife being entitled to apply for post-divorce maintenance while the latter was premised on the subsistence of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the instant case, the parties and the Child are presently residing in Singapore. While parties and the Child are Indian nationals, nationality <em>per se</em> is of limited significance as noted by the High Court in <em>BDA</em> at [29]. Parties are working in Singapore on their respective employment passes and are earning income from their work here. The Child is also presently enrolled in nursery in Singapore. The relevant living expenses of the Wife and the Child are incurred in Singapore. The marriage still subsists. If the matter is heard in India, both parties would have to travel from Singapore to India to attend to this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While the Husband contends that parties’ stay in Singapore was temporary in nature and could be terminated at any point if their respective employment passes were not renewed, I did not think this was a strong factor to grant a stay as there was no evidence put before me that suggested that parties were at imminent risk of losing their jobs or that their employment passes would be terminated. In any event, should circumstances change, parties may make the appropriate application (if necessary) to vary and/or rescind any maintenance orders that have been made in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Further, any maintenance order made in MSS 1289 would be temporary in nature for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Any spousal maintenance order made in MSS 1289 would cease to operate once the divorce proceedings have concluded in India and the Wife ceases to be a “wife” married to the Husband under the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The child maintenance order would also be superseded by any ancillary orders made by the Indian Court in relation to child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I also did not agree with the Husband that there was an issue of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> arising. The pending divorce proceedings instituted by the Husband in India (which deals with reliefs arising post-termination of marriage) was not for the same relief as that claimed by the Wife in the present maintenance application in Singapore. MSS 1289 (at least in respect of the Wife’s claim for spousal maintenance) is premised on the subsistence of the marriage and any child maintenance order made in Singapore in these proceedings would similarly be overtaken by the ancillary orders made by the Indian Court. Thus, both proceedings are distinct and do not cover the same grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I also address the Husband’s argument that the decision made by the learned Deputy Presiding Judge to stay the Singapore divorce proceedings in D 5293 was binding on this Court. Firstly, no legal basis was put forward as why the outcome of the stay application in D 5293 would be binding on this court. Secondly, the granting of the Husband’s stay application in D 5293 meant that Singapore was not the appropriate forum to deal with the divorce and ancillary issues. However, as stated above, the issues being raised in the application in MSS 1289 were not covering the same ground as the divorce proceedings in India. Finally, the Husband’s argument that any maintenance orders made in MSS 1289 would interfere with the Indian divorce proceedings and complicate the overall financial adjudication was not convincing. There were no specifics provided by the Husband beyond this bare assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Ultimately, as stated by the Court in <em>BDA</em>, two questions must be addressed by the court in a s 69 application. First, the wife must show that she needs maintenance and that the husband has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her and any child of the marriage. Second, the court will have to determine the quantum required for maintenance. On the first question, the court in Singapore is as well placed as any other to decide on the issue. As regards the second question, it would appear that the Singapore Court would be better placed to decide on this issue. First, the parties and the Child are presently residing in Singapore. Second, in determining the quantum of maintenance, the court shall have to take into account the standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and the Child before the Husband’s neglect or refusal to maintain them (see s 69(4)(f) of the Women’s Charter) and the present maintenance that they require. These determinations would be based on their expenses incurred in Singapore since they have been and are presently residing in Singapore.

The Complainant is 44 years old this year. The Respondent is 50 years old this year. The Complainant and the Respondent live separately. The Complainant lives with her son, though her parents and her other sisters sometimes live with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 26 June 2024, the Complainant applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Respondent. On 19 July 2024, the Respondent applied for a personal protection order against the Complainant. I heard both applications together and dismissed both. The Complainant has filed an appeal against my decision to dismiss her application. As the Respondent did not file any appeal against my decision to dismiss hers, this decision will focus on my reasons for dismissing the Complainant’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Complainant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In the Complainant’s complaint form (the “Complaint Form”), she claimed that the Respondent caused hurt to her, placed her in fear of hurt, and continually harassed her. The Complainant primarily relied on an incident on 24 June 2024 to support her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Complainant’s recount of the incident on 24 June 2024 is, in brief, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Complainant had just stepped out of her room after a shower and was surprised to see the Respondent sitting in the dining area of her home. The Respondent did not inform the Complainant that she would be there.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent then started threatening the Complainant. The Respondent brought up the fact of the Complainant’s recent divorce from her former husband, saying “<em>that is why your ex-spouse and you have to divorce because you are like this</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Respondent started taking a video of the Complainant using her phone. This agitated the Complainant, who asked the Respondent to stop. The Respondent refused to stop, saying “<em>I want to see how you’re so angry</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Respondent called the Complainant’s son, to ask him to look at the Complainant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Complainant saw her mother packing her belongings into her luggage and noticed that she had taken a teeth retainer belonging to one of her sister’s daughters. The Complainant told her mother to remove this from her luggage. When she did not comply, the Complainant removed this from the luggage herself using her right hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Respondent and her mother then tried to stop the Complainant. The Respondent tried to grab the teeth retainer and hurt the Complainant in the process. After the Respondent successfully took away the teeth retainer from the Complainant, the Complainant freed herself.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal requirements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The definition of ‘family violence’ is set out in Section 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). This includes the commission of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Section 64 of the Charter also defines ‘hurt’ as “<em>bodily pain, disease and infirmity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 65(1) of Charter 1961 provides that the court may grant a PPO if two requirements have been met. First, the court must be satisfied that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed. Second, the court must be satisfied that a protection order is necessary for the protection of that family member. The burden of proof is on the Complainant to prove that these two requirements have been met on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On the balance of the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that the Respondent had committed family violence on the Complainant, or that the Respondent was likely to commit family violence on the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent cause the Complainant hurt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Complainant claimed that the physical altercation caused her soreness on her right arm, scratches on her palm and wrist, and a bruise near her thumb. These injuries could constitute “hurt”, as defined in Section 64 of the Charter. The Complainant adduced five pictures showing a wound on her right palm and marks around her right hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She also adduced a memo with a referral letter, certifying that the Complainant had visited a clinic on 26 June 2024 for “<em>right shoulder strain and superficial abrasion over right wrist and palm</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The evidence provided by the Complainant may have shown that the Complainant did suffer some injuries, but it did not necessarily establish that it was the Respondent who caused her these injuries. It remained unclear from the evidence <em>who</em> caused the injuries and <em>how</em> they were caused:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no evidence advanced by the Complainant to show that the Respondent was responsible for the injuries, bearing in mind that the tussle over the teeth retainer (that the Complainant says led to the hurt) was a tussle that involved three persons. There was also a lack of detail and description, whether in her Complaint Form, her affidavit, or from her oral evidence, to explain just <em>how</em> the Respondent had caused her the injuries she claimed. Even the referral form issued by the clinic she visited on 26 June 2024 stated that the Complainant was “<em>uncomfortable to elaborate more other than she was pushed</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During cross-examination, when asked about the cause of the blister on her palm, the Complainant was initially reserved in levelling any accusation that it was the Respondent who directly caused her injuries. Instead, her response was more oblique and general, saying that it was caused by the “<em>commotion … by the physical interaction that was---came towards [her] while the Respondent is trying to take the teeth retainer from [her] palm</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Respondent in fact did not seem certain as to the cause of the blister, saying that she “<em>suspect[ed]</em>” that it was from a sharp nail.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While the Complainant complained of a pain on her upper arm and suggested that this was caused during her physical altercation with the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, she had, in her Complaint Form, also conceded that this was because she “<em>just had [her] covid booster on 7<sup>th</sup> June</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This cast doubt over whether the Respondent was responsible for the pain that the Complainant felt in her upper arm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Further, I note that there were some inconsistencies in the Complainant’s evidence, which in my view diminished the credibility and likelihood of the Complainant’s claims relating to her injuries:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her Complaint Form, the Complainant accused the Respondent of “<em>hurting [the Complainant’s] palm with scratches and bruise on [her] right hand</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, in C1, which contained the Complainant’s fleshed-out evidence, the Complainant did not mention being scratched by the Respondent at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In C1, the only acts of physical contact alleged were that the Respondent pushed the Complainant when trying to snatch the teeth retainer from her, and that the Respondent had restrained her (implied in the Complainant’s claim that she had to “<em>free [herself]</em>” from the Respondent). However, there was no suggestion on the Complaint Form that the Respondent pushed the Complainant or tried to restrain her. It is also noted that the nature of family violence complained of by the Complainant was not that of physical restraint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence before me, I therefore found that the Complainant was unable to prove that the Respondent had caused her the hurt she claimed to have suffered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent place the Complainant in fear of hurt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Complainant did not articulate in what way she had been placed in fear of hurt. While she suggests in C1 that she had to “<em>break free</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> from the Respondent, there was no indication that the Respondent had intended to hurt her, such that she should have been afraid of being hurt if she had not freed herself. This is especially so where on the face of the Complainant’s evidence, the Respondent appeared focused on taking the teeth retainer away from the Complainant, rather than on specifically inflicting or threatening to inflict any sort of hurt on the Complainant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Complainant also mentioned being ‘threatened’ by the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. However, there were no details as to what was said, or what were the threads made by the Respondent. There also did not appear to be any history of the Respondent threatening to hurt the Complainant, nor was there any suggestion that the Respondent was predisposed to inflict violence, such as to give the Complainant cause for such concern.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore did not find sufficient evidence to establish that the Respondent had placed the Complainant in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent continually harass the Complainant?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Complainant claims to have been traumatised by the Respondent’s unannounced entry into her home. The Respondent had not given the Complainant any prior notice that she would be there, and the Complainant was surprised to see the Respondent in her home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I did not find the Respondent’s entry into the Complainant’s home in itself to have placed the Complainant in fear of hurt (given the absence of any threat of hurt), or to amount to continual harassment for the purposes of establishing family violence. Both the Respondent and her mother each had a key to the Complainant’s home, and there was also no evidence that the Complainant had asked the Respondent to return her house keys prior to the incident. This suggests that the Complainant did not consider them to be persons whom she was afraid of and whom she could not trust with access to her home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Furthermore, the Respondent did not enter the Complainant’s home by force, nor did she do so without reason. It was evident that she was there to accompany her mother, who was there to pack her belongings which were left in the Complainant’s home. In this context, it did not seem to me that the Respondent had appeared in the Complainant’s home with the intent of causing her anguish. In fact, it is unclear to me whether the Respondent would even have known that her presence in the house would have caused the Complainant anguish. I therefore did not find the Respondent’s entry into the Complainant’s home, as unwelcome as it may have been, to amount to continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Respondent had also allegedly made hurtful remarks to the Complainant about her relationship with her ex-husband, started taking a video of the Complainant, and asked the Complainant’s son to look at her while she was angry. Taken at face value, I accept that such acts could be provocative and aggravating. However, I did not find these claims to have been established on the evidence presented. In any case, the law requires that any harassment must be continual (see <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [43]); that is, the act must be repeated or repetitive (see <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [6(d)(ii)]). I did not consider any harassment that may have been caused to the Complainant to be <em>continual</em>, bearing in mind that there was no suggestion or proof of that the Respondent had previously provoked the Complaint in similar fashion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore did not find the Respondent to have committed family violence against the Complainant by way of continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Having found no family violence committed by the Respondent, I consequently declined to grant the PPO sought by the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, <em>even if</em> I were to find that the Respondent had inflicted family violence on the Complainant (which I did not in this case), I would not have found a protection order to be <em>necessary</em> for the protection of the Complainant. In my view, the tussle on 24 June 2024 was a one-off incident between the parties that started when the Complainant removed a teeth retainer from her mother’s luggage. It was her mother who first intervened to stop the Complainant, before the Respondent intervened. There does not appear to have been any other incident between them, whether before or after this incident, whether within the Complainant’s home, or anywhere else. It was also the Complainant’s position that the Respondent never entered her home before this incident, even though the Respondent held a key to her home, which suggests a low probability of the circumstances on 24 June 2024 repeating itself. I also noted that between the hearing on 27 November 2024 and 13 January 2025, the Respondent returned her copy of the Complainant’s home key to the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In any event, I also noted that it was the Complainant’s own evidence that her interaction with the Respondent was limited at best. The Complainant’s evidence was that the parties were not close to each other, and that if at all, they only communicate to arrange for the Respondent’s daughter to give tuition to the Complainant’s son, which the Respondent’s daughter had been doing since March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Complainant said that the parties would cross paths with each other during family gatherings such as Chinese New Year, however I find the incidence of any family violence during such group settings to be unlikely. I therefore found the risk of the Respondent committing family violence against the Complainant in future to be low or non-existent, and that a PPO would therefore have been unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As neither party made any request for costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 13 September 2024 (“C1”), para 13</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>C1, para 15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>C1, para 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>C1, para 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>C1, paras 19 - 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>C1, paras 20 - 22</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>C1, p 47 - 51</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>C1, p 53 - 56</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>C1, p 56</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 27 November 2024 (“NE1”), p 9 lines 3 - 4</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE1, p 19 lines 19 - 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE1, p 19 lines 16 – 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>C1, p 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>C1, p 16 - 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>C1, paras 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>See C1, paras 21 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>C1, para 15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>C1, para 10</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Guardianship – Welfare of child","Family Law – Custody – Care and Control – Access"],"date":"2025-04-30","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act 1934) No 77/2024, FC/Summons 3478/2024","title":"XLJ v XLK","citation":"[2025] SGFC 42","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33199-SSP.xml","counsel":["Cornelius Sng (Advox Law LLC) for the Applicant in OSG 77 /2024 and Respondent in Summons 3478/2024","Respondent in person in OSG 77/2024 and Applicant in Person in Summons 3478/2024"],"timestamp":"2025-05-08T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XLJ v XLK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XLJ <em>v</em> XLK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33199-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 42</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Mother also applied for the Father to surrender the child's passport to the Mother or to her solicitors forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother alleged the Father had unlawfully removed the child from her lawful custody in China and eventually brought the child into Singapore. He had also refused to return the child to the Mother though she was granted custody of the child by the Chinese Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Pending the final determination of OSG 77, the Mother filed for an injunction in Summons No 1903/2024 to prevent the Father from bringing the child out of Singapore without the Mother’s written consent or an Order of Court. An injunction was granted to prevent both parties from removing the child out of Singapore without the consent of the Court or the written consent of the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 7 November 2024, the Father filed Summons 3478/2024 (“Summons 3478”) for orders that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_I\"></a>I)     The parties have joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II\"></a>II)     The Mother have care and control of the child, on the condition that the Father shall have liberal access, including overnight and overseas access, to the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Regular Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_a\"></a>(a)       On weekdays, the Father have access on at least two weekdays a week, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_b\"></a>(b)       The Father have access during the weekends, from Saturday after lunch to Sunday after lunch, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Specific Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_c\"></a>(c)       In addition to the regular access, both parties shall endeavour to celebrate the child’s birthday together as a family at such date/time to be mutually agreed in writing and in advance.

Having considered parties’ evidence and submissions, I granted the Mother sole custody, care and control of the child solely for the purpose of having the child return to China, that the Father shall take all required steps to facilitate the handing over of the child to the Mother and shall surrender the child’s passport to the Mother or to her solicitors within 7 days of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Pending the handing over of the child, I ordered that the injunction issued against the Mother be discharged and made a further order to prevent the Father from removing the child out of Singapore without consent or approval of the Court or the written consent of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having made the order in OSG 77, I dismissed the Father’s applications in Summons 3478 and awarded costs against him on both applications. The Father has since appealed against the whole of my decision in OSG 77<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. I now set out the reasons for my decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The parties were married in China on 30 March 2016. A child who was born in January 2019 in China and was 6 plus years old when OSG 77 was heard. The parties and the child were Chinese citizens.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The parties filed for divorce in China which was heard by the People’s Court of Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, China (“First Instance Court”) on 26 June 2023. The First Instance Court did not make its decision immediately and deferred it to another day. Pending the decision, the Mother alleged that the Father took the child away forcefully from her on 28 June 2023. The Father denied doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 7 August 2023, the First Instance Court granted the divorce and ordered, amongst other things, that the child “shall be raised and educated” by the Mother. The following were the court’s findings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Considering that [the Child] is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by [the Mother]. Therefore, [the Child] … shall be raised and educated by [the Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Dissatisfied with the decision, the Father appealed to the Intermediate People’s Court of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China (“Appellate Court”). The Appellate Court, whose decision is final, upheld the decision of the First Instance Court on 23 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother subsequently found out that the Father and the child came to Singapore on 11 December 2023 based on a copy of the child’s Visit Pass issued by the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoint Authority. The Mother had not seen the child from 28 June 2023 till 11 December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Consequent to the Father’s failure to comply with the two Court decisions, the Mother applied for enforcement of the court orders against the Father. A Written Decision of Detention dated 9 February 2024, and a Written Decision of Enforcement dated 27 February 2024 were issued by the Court of First Instance and the Appellate Court respectively. In the Written Decision of Detention, the Court decided that the Father be detained for 15 days for the non -compliance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. In the Written Decision of Enforcement, the Appellate Court issued an order to prevent the Father from leaving the country and cancelled his travel documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Despite these orders, the Father still did not return the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Further, on 8 April 2024, a Notice of Order to Fulfil was issued against the Father by the Appellate Court to hand over the child’s identity card and travel documents to the Mother for safe keeping<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. According to the Father, by this time he was no longer in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother filed OSG 77 on 18 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 9 September 2024, the Father filed an application in another court in China, the Hangzhou Xihu District People’s Court (“Hangzhou Court”) for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> . The application was still pending when OSG 77 was heard. To date, the child remained in Singapore with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother was represented throughout the proceedings. The Father was also represented during the pre-trial proceedings but chose to act in person just before the hearing of both applications. Both parties submitted written submissions which were considered, together with the oral submissions, before the decisions were made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     There was a total of 13 affidavits filed for purposes of OSG 77 and Summons 3478.

She had taken care of him full time from birth on 22 January 2019 to the year 2022. He was still young and dependent on her as his mother and that it would be in the child’s best interest and more conducive for his development that he be raised and cared for by her as the primary caregiver. She informed that the child had lived for most of his life in China and would benefit from her looking after him in an environment he is familiar with. She disagreed that he should be uprooted from China to settle down in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     She contended that the Chinese courts has awarded her sole custody of the child. The Father has never discussed with her and that she has not given consent for the child to be taken out of China. She also contended that having sole custody, care and control of the child is in line with the Chinese’s Court’s findings and decisions. The child also has a strong support system with her as well as with her father, a retired civil servant, who is living with her and willing to assist in taking care of and raising the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Before being taken away by the Father, the child was studying in kindergarten and could resume in an environment he is familiar with. The Mother works as an insurance agent and event planner which gave her autonomy and flexible working hours to enable her to tend to the child’s day to day needs including ferrying the child for his daily activities. This is despite her busy schedule. She has also enrolled the child in various other classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     She informed that she is more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. She also offered to discuss the issue of access with the Father, but he has been avoiding the matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Father only reached out to her via WeChat after the application was filed by her. As for the video calls sessions he arranged for her with the child, the timings were not suitable as they coincided with the child’s play time. She denied the Father’s allegations that she is the cause of the tension in the marriage and that in reality, the Father was engaged in extra-marital affair and neglected the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the 1st Instance Court Mother was relying on <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With regards to the issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the 1<sup>st</sup> Instance Court on 7 August 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody, that is, (name of child)’s custody. Through the evidence adduced by both parties and the court investigation, the court notes that both the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as their parents, have great care and love for (the child), and that the parties have inseparable feelings for their child. Considering that (the child) is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by (the Mother). Therefore, (name of child), the legitimate son of the parties, shall be raised and educated by (the Mother) and the defendant shall pay the plaintiff a monthly maintenance of CNY 3,000 until (the child) lives on his own. Accordingly, as per Article 1079, Article 1084, Article 1085 and Article 1087 of the Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, the court hereby makes the following judgments:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">1.    (The Mother), the plaintiff, and (the Father), the defendant, are granted divorce;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    (The Child), the legitimate son of both parties shall be raised and educated by (the Mother), and (the Father) shall pay child’s support of CNY 3,000 before the 15th of each month from the month when the judgments take effect until (the child) independent life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the Appellate Court the Mother was relying on </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On the same issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the Appellate Court on 23 Nov 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> :</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The determination of custody shall be deemed on the specific circumstances of his parents and judged in accordance with the principles that is the most favourable to the minor child. From the birth to 2021, the legitimate son was raised full-time by (the Mother), the appellee and he is currently only four years old. From the perspective of the law of the physical and mental development of the young child, relatively he is more dependent on his mother at this age stage. At present his cognitive ability has not yet fully developed due to his young age. So the ownership of his custody cannot be decided with his cognition only. At the same time, according to the statements of both parties at the trial, the legitimate son is temporarily living with (the Father) during the first-instance litigation of the case due to the conflict between both parties taking care of him in turn. Therefore it is not enough to conclude that he has had a relatively stable living and growing environment. In addition, (the Mother) has the ability and conditions to raise the child. Although (the Father) advocates that (the Moher) is not suitable to raise him, he does not adduce any evidence to prove that she has obvious unfavourable circumstances for raising the child. In view of the above factors, this court holds that the court of first instance should be correct in ordering the legitimate son to be raised and educated by (the Mother) in accordance with the principle that is most beneficial to underage child and in determining that the Father should pay monthly maintenance of CNY3,000 to the legitimate son until he lives on his own on the basis of his actual needs and the level of local consumption etc. It is hoped that both parties can put aside disputes in the future, negotiate amicably on the issues such as visitation from the perspective of maximising the interest of the child, avoid conflicts, try to reduce the possible adverse effects of parental divorce on him and ensure that he can enjoy the companionship and love of both parents and grow up healthy and strong in a peaceful , tranquil and friendly living environment. In summary, according to Article 177, Paragraph1 (1) of Law of the Peoples’ Republic of China on Civil Procedure, this court decides as follows: dismiss the appeal and uphold the original judgment... This judgment is final.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother submitted her solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit of 17 December 2024. The solicitor is a practicing lawyer in China whose area of expertise included dealing with civil cases such as family division and divorce. He was engaged by the Mother to respond to the legal opinion of the Father’s solicitor dated 5 September and 26 October 2024 which were found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Mother posed a total of 16 questions for her solicitor’s legal opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The more relevant questions and the responses of the Father and Mother’s solicitor are set out below for ease of comparison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The following question is relevant on the issue of custody:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    What responsibilities and rights do the Mother has regarding the child under the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Father’s solicitor: The Chinese Court order states that the Mother has the responsibility and right to raise and educate the child. This implies that the Mother is entitled to live with the child, as well as the obligation to raise and take care of, provide daily necessities to, cultivate, and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Mother’s solicitor: Under the Chinese Court Judgment, the Mother has the responsibility and right to directly raise and educate the child. This includes the right to live with the child, as well as the responsibility to nurture, care for, provide for the child’s daily needs, and foster the child’s education and development. The Mother also has the right to make decisions about the child’s living arrangements and educational matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On access or visitation rights, the solicitors’ opinion on the various issues was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What access or visitation rights does the Father have according to the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: The Father’s right to the child include the rights to contact, associate with, meet, visit, accompany, look after, protect, educate, and live together for short periods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Father’s solicitor response to (k) that the Father has the right to live with the child for a short period, the Mother has asked her solicitor as to what is the upper limit of &quot;short-term&quot; and his response was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Under Chinese law and judicial interpretations, there is no legal definition or upper limit for &quot;short-term.&quot; Living with the child for a &quot;short-term&quot; period requires the consent of the direct custodian and exceeds the scope of visitation rights. Visitation rights typically involve supervised visits during agreed-upon times, without the right to take the child away. In this case, the Father never agreed with the Mother on how visitation would occur. Instead, the Father forcibly took the child away before the court's judgment and, after the judgment was issued, left the country and refused to comply with the Chinese court’s ruling. The Mother never consented to the Father taking the child out of the country or to the child living with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(l)    What is the legal procedure for enforcing visitation rights in China?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Chinese law grants the parent who is not directly responsible for the care of the child the right to access the child. The parent may file an application to request that the court set the schedule and terms of access. The court shall accept the application of the person who has the right of access and make a judgment on the time and manner of access in accordance with the law. If the party who directly raises the child refuses to facilitate the access rights holder in enforcing the access rights after the judgment has entered into force, the access rights holder may petition the court for execution. The execution approach taken by the court is mainly to persuade the party who directly raises the child to do so voluntarily, the court may penalise him/her by imposing a fine, detention, or other measures. Nonetheless, the court hardly ever impose fines or incarceration on the parent who is raising the child directly in order to protect the child from potential harm. Therefore, if the party directly raising the child does not voluntarily fulfill the responsibility of assisting access, the access rights of the access parent will not be realised. The enforcement of access rights has always been a challenging matter in Chinese legal practice because the party who is directly responsible for the care of the child typically does not cooperate with access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to Article 1086 of the Civil Code, after a divorce, the parent who does not directly raise the child has the right to visit the child, while the other parent has the obligation to facilitate this. The method and timing of visitation are to be agreed upon by both parties. If no agreement is reached, the people’s court will make a ruling. If visitation is deemed harmful to the child’s physical or mental health, the court may suspend visitation. Once the reasons for suspension no longer exist, visitation rights should be restored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The custodial parent typically provides visitation rights twice a month. If the custodial parent does not cooperate with visitation arrangements, the non-custodial parent may file a lawsuit with the court to request a judicial determination of the visitation schedule and method. The court must accept the application and issue a ruling on the timing and manner of visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Once the ruling takes effect, if the custodial parent refuses to facilitate visitation, the non-custodial parent can apply to the court for compulsory enforcement. The court will initially attempt to persuade the custodial parent to voluntarily comply and fulfil their obligation to assist with visitation. If the custodial parent continues to refuse, the court may impose penalties, including fines, detention, or even criminal charges. The custodial parent cannot refuse enforcement measures, as failure to comply without valid reason could result in criminal liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(n)    Under Chinese law, does the Father have any measures to prevent being deprived of visitation rights to the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Under Chinese law, the Father does not have any measures to prevent being deprived of the right to have access to the child. The Father will have to take legal action to exercise his right to have access to the child if the Mother refuses to facilitate the same. However, even if the Father exercises his right of access through legal proceedings, if the Mother still does not facilitate access, the Father’s right of access to the child cannot be realised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Visitation rights are a common issue in many divorce cases across China. As a country with a well established judicial system, Chinese law ensures that if the Mother attempts to deprive the Father of visitation rights, the Father can file a lawsuit. The court will rule on the method and schedule of visitation. If the judgment or ruling is not complied with, the responsible party may face criminal liability. Under current Chinese law, unless a court determines that visitation by the Father is harmful to the child, no one has the authority to deprive the Father of visitation rights to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In relation to the question of who could decide on the child’s care and education arrangements, the Father’s solicitor has provided his legal opinion on question “(d)” as to what are the Father’s responsibilities and rights under the Notice of Order for Performance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The Mother’s solicitor asked her solicitor to elaborate on the practical effect of the Father being the child's &quot;legal guardian&quot; and having &quot;the same responsibilities and rights to raise and educate the child as the Mother&quot; and which party has the authority to decide the child's care and education arrangements?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: According to the Notice of Order for Performance, the Father has the responsibility to hand over the child to the Mother for caregiving. Pursuant to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the Peoples Republic of China, “The parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children. Whether the children are raised by their mother or father after the parent’s divorce, they will always be the children of both parents. Parents still have the right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following divorce.” Although the Mother is currently the caregiver of the child, according to the Chinese Court Order, and has the right to live with the child, the right of caregiving is not unchangeable, and the Father has the right to apply for a change in the caregiver of the child at any time by filing an application. At the same time, even if the caregiver is not changes, the Father is still the child’s legal guardian and has the same responsibility and right as the Moher to raise and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to the Civil Code and relevant provisions, the Shangcheng District People's Court of Hangzhou issued Civil Judgment (2023) Zhe 0102 Min Chu 7390, determining that the Mother is the child’s direct custodian. The child's direct custody by the Mother is protected by the court and enforceable through compulsory measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under the Civil Code, the direct custodian is the parent living with the child, who has the authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education. The direct custodian holds a higher guardianship status. In this case, the Mother, as the direct custodian, has the sole authority to arrange the child's living conditions and educational plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Legal guardianship based on blood relations (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings, etc.) is supplementary. If the direct custodian is unable to fulfil their duties, other guardians have the right and obligation to take on the role of direct custodian. However, their guardianship primarily serves a supporting and supervisory role. This legislative intent aligns closely with similar provisions in Singaporean law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the Mother’s submission, counsel raised that the only relevant issue for the court’s determination is whether the child’s best interest is served by granting the Mother sole custody or joint custody of the child. It was submitted that it is in the best interest of the child for sole custody to be granted to her citing the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the child’s needs are best fulfilled by the Mother who is the child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the father has not acted in the child’s best interest at all by unilaterally and forcibly removing the child from the Mother’s care; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the parties and the child have no connection to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Counsel for the Mother also pointed out that the crux of the Father’s application appeared to be his purported concern and fear about being deprived on access to the child if sole custody was granted to the Mother and he was brought back to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Counsel also submitted that granting the Father’s application for custody would “effectively endorse and legitimise de facto child abduction by the Father” and in effect, be rewarding the Father for his blatant disregard of existing Chinese court orders. It would also create a dangerous precedent, incentivising parents to flout court orders and unlawfully disrupt their children’s lives in hopes of gaining a more favourable outcome in a different and further encourage further manipulations of legal processes. Finally, granting custody to the Father would send a troubling message that the legal system permits parents to exploit legal loopholes, uprooting children from stable environments and manipulating the law to further their own interests. Such conduct should not be tolerated, as it undermines the very principles of justice and fairness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Father informed that since the application in OSG 77 was filed by the Mother, both parties made substantial efforts to resolve the matter amicably but were unsuccessful. He denied that he had taken the child forcibly from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     During the marriage both parties and the child lived in their matrimonial home and on weekends, the child would stay with his parent’s residence and joined by the Mother at times. Since the child was born, he has been involved in caring for him as he had a stable job with fixed working hours and was able to work overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     After April 2021, due to the Mother’s job as insurance agent, she was frequently occupied even at night. At the hearing of the first instance court, he had submitted his evidence to show the Mother was too busy to look after the child and often left him to his care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father related various significant events during the marriage where they had frequent disagreements wherein the Mother would often be emotionally unstable, acted out in front of the child and in these disagreements, the Mother would take the child away from the matrimonial home to the Mother’s parent’s residence. He also related various attempts by the Mother to gain an advantage in the divorce proceedings by using the child as a pawn and other past conduct, which he had also raised before the Chinese Courts which eventually gave the right to raise and educate the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 28 June 2023, the Father had gone to the Mother’s parent’s residence to take the child according to the parties’ agreed scheduled but was refused by the Mother. Despite that, he managed to leave the place with the child and due to the Mother’s persistent conduct of denying him access, he was afraid to hand the child back to her the following weekend and thereafter. His attempt to resolve the matter through a third party also failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     After taking the child into his care, he took 2 months of extended leave to take the child on holiday, brought him and his parents to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Huizhou and Guangzhou, enrolled him in a pre-school near his parent’s residence. In November 2023, he brought the child to Phuket Thailand and on 11 December 2023 brought him to Singapore where he intended to have him commence his formal education in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father enrolled the child into the Australian International School on 22 January 2024 which he claimed to be what the parties has agreed to some time back. He contended that the child was comfortable living with him since 28 June 2023 and performing well at school. He shared the child’s daily routine where he would send and fetch the child from school and on weekends would accompany him to swimming classes or other activities. The Father lived here with his retired mother who was on a Long Term Visit Pass and who could assist with the care-giving duties. He believed it would be in the child’s best interest that he remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Father informed that it was important that the access orders he was seeking in his summons are recorded in an Order of Court. This was because the 7 August 2023 Order (in China) did not specify any access for him, or any contact with the child would continue with him as his father. In view of the Mother’s past conduct of denying access he was deeply concerned that he would be excluded completely from the child’s life once the child return to China. He was advised by his Chinese lawyers and believed that the Chinese Courts do not ordinarily make specific orders on access and expect parties to resolve the issue of access on their own<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. Based on past events, both parties were not able to resolve the issue of access and thus wished for his access to the child to be crystallised in an Order of Court to be mirrored by-consent in China so that his right to have time with the child in China would be preserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     With regards to the decision of the Appellate Court, the Father contended that the Court has erred in their judgment. He was aware of the Written Decision of Detention, the Written Decision of Enforcement and the Notice of Order to Fulfil issued against him but claimed that he was in Singapore by the time these decisions were made and was not served with these decisions. He contended that these orders do not have any extraterritorial effect though he would likely be subject to them upon his return to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father relied on his solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024 and 18 February 2025. The solicitor has been practicing in China for 23 years specialising in economic and matrimonial cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Father posed 9 questions set out in the solicitor’s affidavit of 10 December and a further 8 questions set out in the 18 February affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Based on the legal opinion given, in relation to the Court order, the Father disagreed that the order was clear as to the issue of the child’s custody, care and control. The words of the 7 August 2023 Order stated that the child “… shall be raised and educated by [the Mother]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father’s reasons were, firstly, there is no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and he was advised and believed that it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. It is therefore inaccurate and misleading for the Mother to allege that she had been granted “sole custody” of the child. This position completely ignores the default position in Chinese law, which he explained in the paragraph below. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     According to his solicitor’s legal opinion, the default position under Chinese law is that “the parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children.” According to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, both parents are the joint legal guardians of the child and share a joint “right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following a divorce.” As could be seen from the Chinese Legal Opinion, the Father has an equal say in long-term major decisions relating to the child ’s care under Chinese law and the Mother should not seek to deprive him of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father submitted written submissions which were likely prepared by himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In his oral submission, on the day in question, he took the child away because the Mother did not abide to their agreement for him to see the child on alternate weekdays and rejected his request to see the child. He thus had no choice but to bring the child home on that day. He was not allowed to see the child on 25 to 27 June though the child who was sick earlier, had recovered. She had subsequently called the police and harassed his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     He reiterated that the parties had agreed to the child receiving education in Singapore due to its bilingual system, and the culture was similar to China. They also had thoughts of Australia but he encountered issues with the visa requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     He claimed that the Mother succeeded in her case in China due to her connections (which the Mother counsel denied in rebuttal). He also claimed that the Mother knew he was coming to Singapore with intent to mediate the case. The Mother didn’t want to agree on access as she knew that in China, his request would not be granted. He agreed to allow the Mother access via video call when she came to Singapore but claimed that between 23 July and 12 August, she did not make any call or visited the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For 21 months, he solely took care of the child who became dependent on him, was very happy, made good progress in school and able to converse in 2 languages. He disagreed that he brought the child here for his own self-interest and that had resigned from his job to take care of the child with his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As he had filed for a variation of the order in China, he made an oral application that the decision of the court in the two applications before me be deferred to after 3 April 2025 which was the date of his variation application in the Hangzhou Court in China. He relied on the rest of his written submissions and affidavits filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In deciding the two applications, I considered the issues set out below as pertinent and relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Is it in interest of the child for him to be return to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(a)   Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I construed the order made by the Chinese Courts as an order for custody which was granted to the Mother. This was borne out even by the judgement of the Court as the word “custody” was used based on the translation made by a neutral third party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The relevant translated grounds of decision of the First Instance Court contained the following statement made by the court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody that is (“the Child”)’s custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The finding by the Court on the above dispute was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">.. it shall be more conducive to his health, growth for him to be raised and educated by Chen Li Ying. Therefore (“the Child”) shall be raised and educated by (“the Mother”) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Based on the above, I came to the view that the Chinese Courts gave the Mother sole custody of the child. This was also supported by the Mother’s solicitor’s opinion in paragraph 32 above which stated that the Mother is the direct custodian of the child and has the sole authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">b)   If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Singapore Courts in dealing with issues involving children which are not of local born has given guidance on the approach to be taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0570.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 570</a>, the Court stated that in custody proceedings, an important consideration had to be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum served. A child’s best interest was best determined by the forum which was best equipped to determine what was best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In this case, the issue of custody had been decided by the court in China which has the closest connection to the parties and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In matters which has been decided by a foreign Court, the Court in <em>AB v AC and Another Application</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27027-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 6</a>, at paragraph 15 of the decision, cited a High Court decision in <em>Igra v Igra</em> [1951] P 404 which held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It has long been accepted that the court of the domicile is the proper tribunal to dissolve a marriage. Its decisions should as far as possible, be acknowledged by other countries in the interests of comity. Different countries have different personal laws, different standards of justice and different practice. The interests of comity are not served if one country is too eager to criticise the standards of another country or too reluctant to recognise decrees that are valid by the law of the domicile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the above case was in relation to dissolution of marriages, the same could apply to ancillary matters. The issue of custody had been litigated extensively in China including at the Appellate Court level whose decision is final. It is important to note that the Father admitted that he had presented to the Court the evidence which he had also submitted to this Court and despite that, an order was made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As there is already an order made on the custody of the child by the Chinese Courts, it would not be in the interest of comity of nations if a Singapore Court is to make another order of custody. By comity I mean that there must be respect between countries shown by accepting each other’s laws, even where there is no reciprocal arrangement to recognise orders made by the two countries. The Father participated in the proceedings in both the courts which culminated in a final decision made by an appellate court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">c)   As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father’s main concern was that the orders made, specifically the 7 August 2023 Order by the First Instance Court did not specify any access for him. This was also reflected in the various prayers sought in his summons including his prayer for mirror orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     On the issue of access or visitation rights, the Mother’s solicitors provided the following insights on Chinese law:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What visitation rights does the Father has according to the Chinese court judgment?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Both solicitors informed that there are also legal grounds under the Chinese law for a variation of a child custody order. They also pointed out that there are safeguards available for the Father should he be denied access such as fines imposed by the Chinese courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Of the two, I was of the view that the Mother’s solicitor interpretation of the court orders and opinion on the relevant issues were more reliable for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s solicitor opined that the Father has not violated the Chinese Court Orders simply because they can be varied. I agreed with the Mother’s counsel that the Father’s solicitor’s opinion is non-sensical.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s solicitor must have advised the Father who was made to believe that in the Appellate Court order, there was no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and thus it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. This was despite the court referring to the order as the order for custody of the child, based on the translation of the court decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father’s solicitor’s interpretation of the court order went against the grain of the two Chinese Court Order when he opined that “After divorcing (the Mother), (the Father) … has the same responsibility and right as (the Mother) to raise, take care of, and educate (the child).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I further note that the Father himself had applied to another Court in China, the Hangzhou Court, for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him which application was still pending when OSG 77 and the above-mentioned summons were heard. This was one of the factors which I took into account in dismissing the summons filed by the Father based on <em>Re A</em>’s case. In <em>Re A</em>’s case, the father himself had chosen to have the issues of custody and access determined by the foreign court. As such, any appeal or application in relation to custody or access should be litigated or re-litigated in China by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">d)   Is it in interest of the child for him to be returned to the Applicant Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     This is the crux of the matter at hand. In OSG 77, the Mother has applied under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934. She asked that she be given sole custody, care and control of the child and for the Father to hand over the child and his travel document to her. In essence, she was asking that the child to be returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In deciding matters relating custody of children, the overarching principle is found in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The welfare of the child is thus the first and paramount consideration and in particular the court ought to have some regard to the maternal bond between the mother and child as held in <em>Soon Peck Wah</em> v <em>Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>. The Court therein emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. The Court, upon finding that the parents were both capable of looking after the child and had their respective families behind them to help out, stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All these things being equal between the father and mother, a very important factor to bear in mind was the fact that the child was very young. A child at a very tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. This should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care: at [44] and [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Further, in <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a>, the Court of Appeal outlined a non-exhaustive list of factors that the courts should consider, including the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Court stated that the above factors afford a sound starting basis for any court concerned with the issue of the child’s welfare and that factors (a) and (b) are closely related and should generally be considered in tandem. Further, the relevance of these or any other factors to a particular case, and the weight that should be given to each of the factors, is a matter of judgment and will turn on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis of the child’s best interest</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The child was 4 plus years old when he was taken away by the Father and when the application was heard, was 6 plus years old. The court in <em>Soon Pek Wah</em>’s case emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. This was also acknowledged by the First Instance Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> which made a finding that the child is still young and has endless dependence on his mother and thus it “shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by” the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     As for the child educational needs, prior to being taken away, he was in kindergarten. The Mother had enrolled the child in various other classes. After being taken away, he was placed by the Father in an international school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     While the child educational needs could be met either by him remaining in China or Singapore, the fact that the child is young weighed in favour of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Mother stated that she works as an insurance agent and event planner, and this gave her autonomy and flexibility in her working hours to attend to the child’s needs. She is supported by her retired father to attend to the child in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father’s occupation after he left his company of 10 years on 22 November 2023 was not made known in his affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s mother who was on Long Term Visit Pass lived with the child who has been issued with a Student Pass. The Father informed that his mother’s Long Term Visit Pass was tied to the child’s Student Pass. The Father also informed that he had applied for a Long Term Visit Pass which was also tied to the child’s Student Pass<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. It was not clear what his long term plans are. If he were to return to China, we would have to deal with the orders made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Based on the above, I was of the view the Mother would be able to provide a more stable environment for the child’s needs, growth and safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I did not find any evidence of any wrong-doing or anything against the Mother or any of her immediate family with regards to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It is well recognised that it is in a child’s best interests post-divorce for him to maintain a good relationship with both his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Mother informed that she was more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law. According to the Mother’s solicitor, the method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Father on the other hand, instead of going back to the Chinese courts, had taken things into his own hands and had not allowed the Mother to have access to the child for long periods after the Father took the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In my view, this factor weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The child was taken out of China and brought to Singapore where he was enrolled into a school so that he could be bilingual. Whilst the child had been in Singapore since December 2023, he had lived most of his life in China and taken care of by the Mother on full time basis from January 2019 to 2022 when the Mother started work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Bearing in mind the importance of maternal bond, especially for young children as stated in Soon Peck Wah’s case, this factor also weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the parents’ character and conduct</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     This was an additional factor which the court in <em>TSF v TSE</em> took into account in determining welfare of the child. The Father clearly had brought the child out of China for his own interest after he disagreed with the two court orders. Based on the evidence, the circumstances supported the Mother’s claim that the child was taken away from her without her consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Father’s conduct had also led to the issuance of enforcement orders against him. The Father appeared not to have taken the orders seriously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     Having considered the above factors and the circumstances of the case, in the context of our guardianship laws, I came to the view that it is in the child’s best interest for the Mother to be granted care and control of the child. To enable the Mother to exercise this right, bearing in mind that there is already a custody order made by the Chinese court, I ordered that she be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to China with the Mother. I also granted the Mother her second prayer to facilitate the return of the child. Consequently, I dismissed the Father’s application in Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In summary, I made the orders in OSG 77 and dismissed Summons 3478 for following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is in the best interest of the child that the Mother be given care and control of the child, and to enable the Mother to exercise this right, for her to also be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the order made in the main application in OSG 77 which would result in the child being returned to the Mother in China, the child would not be within the jurisdiction requiring any other order for custody, care and control or access to be exercised by any of the parties including the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There are existing orders for custody made by the Chinese Courts that had jurisdiction when the orders were made and will continue to have jurisdiction over the parties. It would be against the comity of nations for another jurisdiction to make another or further order or others on the same matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_d\"></a>(d)     It was open for the Father to litigate the issue relating to the child including his access in China which is the proper forum. There is thus no necessity for a Singapore Court to even consider the mirror orders requested for by the Father. The Father should also deal with the orders made against him for his non-compliance with the two Chinese court orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Lastly, I did not grant the Father’s application to defer my decision on the matter pending the conclusion of the proceedings filed by him in the Hangzhou Court so as not to further prolong the separation of the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     On the issue of costs, the Mother’s solicitor sought $6,000 for OSG 77 and $4,000 for dismissal of Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The powers of the court to fix and assess costs is found in rule 851(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”). Rule 852(2) of the FJR states that costs should “follow the event” except where the court considers that “in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as the whole or part of the costs”. I was of the view that the Father should pay the costs for both sets of applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     There was a total of 13 affidavits filed for the two applications. Several case conferences and court attendances were conducted before the hearing which took close to two hours. An application for an injunction was also made and granted. Written submissions were prepared by the Mother’s solicitors for the purpose of both applications. Having considered the relevant factors, I awarded $4,000 costs for OSG 77 and $2,000 for dismissal of Summons 3478 against the Father.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Father applied for a stay of execution pending the hearing of the appeal.

The group had set ablaze the door and rug of an apartment and had written “O$P$” in indelible ink on an adjacent wall. And the group had done so in response to a job offer on a social media platform that promised payment of $2,000 upon the completion of these tasks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The youth pleaded guilty to the offence in the Youth Court, which called for a probation suitability report to assist it in its formulation of dispositional orders in respect of the youth. While that report was prepared, bail was granted to the youth on conditions that included: (a) a prohibition on him meeting his accomplices; and (b) a requirement for him to continue attend school (collectively, the “Bail Conditions”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Ms Haidah Sharin, a probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, prepared the probation suitability report. Therein, she assessed the youth to have a “High” risk of re-offending due to his propensity for taking risks, his anti-social attitudes (save for his continued association with negative peers), and his unwillingness to improve his lifestyle. She noted that the parents of the youth employed “permissive” parenting that facilitated an “unrestrained lifestyle” without “guidance, intervention and structure”. She thus concluded that the youth was ill-suited for such community-based rehabilitation as probation and recommended that the youth be placed in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (a “JRC”) for 21 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The prosecution endorsed these recommendations, especially the proposal in the probation suitability report that the youth should embark upon a rehabilitation program at the JRC that comprised three sequential stages. The first stage of 3 months would introduce discipline and structure in his lifestyle. The next stage of 12 months would build his capacity for change and strengthen his support networks. The last stage of 6 months would re-integrate him into the community.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The youth and his parents submitted that he should nevertheless be placed on probation. The youth explained that he desired to reside with his family and promised to submit to electronic monitoring to secure his compliance with the terms of his probation. The parents of the youth aligned themselves with this position and promised to cooperate with the probation officer and to inform the authorities should the youth commit any further offences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       All the parties concurred that rehabilitation was the predominant consideration in these proceedings and was in the best interests of the youth, whose welfare was my paramount concern (see s 4(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”). I agreed. The offence, although serious, was not grave. The harm caused was limited to a charred door and rug. The youth was only 13 years of age. The focus on his rehabilitation was justified given the characteristically impulsive nature of his adolescent decision-making. Further, society had a keen interest in his reform given the many years that he had ahead of him. Hence, what remained was for me to decide whether that rehabilitation would be realised better by placing him on probation or in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As VK Rajah JA observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')\">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“<em>Al-Ansari</em>”) at [55], a probation order is a community-based dispositional order. Even as a probation order “seeks to protect society through the supervision to which the offender is required to submit, it both minimises the restrictions placed upon him and offers him the help of society in adjusting his conduct to its demands.” It “seeks to strengthen the offender’s resources so that he may become a more responsible member of the community, which must also play a part in rehabilitating him.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Two conditions must exist for a probation order to be viable. First, the personal characteristics of the offender must render him amenable to community-based rehabilitation (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> (“<em>Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em>”) at [57]). Specifically, he must accept responsibility for his actions, desire to change for the better, and possess the self-discipline to bring that desire to fruition. Second, the offender must have adequate family support and supervision because probationary supervision takes place substantially in the natural setting of the offender and not in a closed institution. The probation officer is “never going to be able to supervise the offender closely on a day-to-day basis” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> at [24]). It is thus incumbent on the family of the offender to ensure that he remains on the straight and narrow. In the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> at [12], “a disciplined home is essential”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I agreed with the prosecution that the structured environment of the JRC would best secure the rehabilitation of the youth. First, the youth was prone to impulsive decision-making and risk-taking, as evidenced in his admission that he had committed the offence for “fast cash” and without regard to the potential occupants in the apartment. Second, although he expressed remorse for his actions, he showed limited commitment to reform. He maintained contact with one accomplice, even as he claimed that it was pressure from his accomplices that had caused him to offend, and even as doing so was a breach of his Bail Conditions. Third, he neglected to continue to attend school, which would have provided him constructive routine, even as such neglect was a further breach of his Bail Conditions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parents of the youth demonstrated little ability to supervise him. First, they were blasé about his offending: they expressed helplessness about it and minimised his role therein by attributing his actions to pressure from his accomplices. Second, they failed to enforce the Bail Conditions even at risk of forfeiture of the bail that they had furnished on his behalf. Third, their proposed plans to supervise him lacked substance and were limited to reminding him orally to avoid criminality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Ultimately, the youth and his parents evinced an indifference to his rehabilitation that rendered impracticable his rehabilitation in the community. The events that followed his plea of guilt and his release into the community on bail were telling. The probation officer scheduled two interviews with the youth to assess his suitability for probation: on 20 and 21 March 2025. But he attended neither interview. He missed the first interview in favour of a meal with one of his accomplices. He missed the second interview and offered no explanation for that absence. In scheduling those interviews, the probation officer had acceded to a request by his parents to avoid the dates of a camp organised by his school. Yet he did not attend that school camp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Separately, the probation officer contacted the parents of the youth to schedule interviews to discuss their supervision of him were he to be placed on probation. But no agreement was reached on a time for these interviews.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 28 March 2025, the probation officer applied to adjourn these proceedings “to 22 April 2025 or later” due to “the youth’s defaulting interview sessions and difficulty in scheduling interviews.” She explained that further engagement with the youth and his parents would “ensure a holistic and thorough probation suitability report”. In response to this request, the prosecution observed: “attempts were made to interview the youth and his family but the latter chose not to turn up and displayed no interest for the welfare/wellbeing of the youth”. The prosecution added that any adjournment should be the “final” one and that “this case shall move on for the youth to receive early rehab programme (if need be).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I fixed the disposition of these proceedings on 15 April 2025 and directed the probation officer to complete the probation suitability report by that date. It was incumbent on the youth and his family, who desired to have him rehabilitated in the community, to work with the probation officer on her assessment of the viability of such rehabilitation. Yet, neither the youth nor his parents had made the effort to meet punctually with the probation officer. Although further engagements with them could conduce to a “holistic and thorough probation suitability report”, their nonchalance towards the assessment of the youth’s suitability for community-based rehabilitation was itself sufficiently probative that probation would be unworkable for the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The parents of the youth explained that their work commitments had hampered them from bringing the youth for his interviews with the probation officer. I accepted their explanation and had no doubt that they were diligently providing for their household. But the issue here was their supervision of the youth in the community. Given that their work commitments would persist even after the conclusion of these proceedings, they would continue to struggle to supervise the youth on a probation order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The probation officer nevertheless indulged the youth and his parents with a further interview on 1 April 2025. But at the appointed time on that day, they were nowhere to be found. Only an hour-and-a-half later did they arrive at the interview venue. Due to this delay, the interview could not take place. When asked about the reasons for this delay, they claimed first that they had boarded the wrong bus then and then that they had alighted at the wrong bus stop. But these claims were inconsistent if not fanciful, further demonstrated their nonchalance towards his rehabilitation, and inspired little confidence that probation would work for the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Under a probation order, an offender is “conditionally entrusted with freedom so that he may learn the social duties it involves” (see <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [55]). But the youth had the discipline of neither himself nor of his home environment to be entrusted with such freedom. The only option that would work for his rehabilitation was the closed and structured environment of the JRC. Given the sustained dearth of discipline in his life, I agreed with the prosecution and the probation officer that a 21-month placement at the JRC that entailed three stages of rehabilitation (see [4] above) was in his best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The parents of the youth argued that a probation order with conditions for hostel residence and electronic monitoring could secure similar supervision of the youth. But this argument reinforced the case for his institutionalisation by recognising that he needed a structured environment with rigorous supervision for his rehabilitation. The self-contained environment of the JRC with its on-site educational facilities and day-to-day supervision would better procure this rehabilitation than the open environment of a hostel, the residents of which must head into the community for their education. To his credit, the youth conceded that he was “uncertain whether hostel residence would help to improve his school attendance and felt worried that he would not be able to adjust to the environment and daily schedule in hostel.” Hence, a probation order, even if coupled with hostel residence and electronic monitoring, would not be in his best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even if a probation order with hostel residence, electronic monitoring, and a suite of supplementary conditions could <em>theoretically</em> approximate the structure and supervision of a JRC placement, a JRC placement would remain the more appropriate order to make. The JRC has been established by the State as the scheme for youth offenders who need institutionalised structure and supervision. The Youth Court should be slow to duplicate this established scheme through improvised probation arrangements. I excerpt the observations of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> in placing an offender on reformative training instead of on probation with residence at a private hostel (at [64]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In my judgment, where a statutory scheme of institutional confinement has been devised by the state and placed at the sentencing disposal of the courts, the court should not ordinarily subvert this by devising alternative schemes that impose terms of probation conditioned on residence in private homes. The courts do not have either the means or the tools, nor for that matter is it our place, to second-guess legislatively crafted sentencing options which have been thought through, deliberated on and developed by policy-makers. Nor, as I observed in the course of oral arguments, should the courts place the offender in the position where he is able to simply pick and choose the terms on which he would like to be rehabilitated. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I thus ordered the youth to reside in the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for 21 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I record my appreciation to Ms Morene Sim and Mr Muhammad Dzulkifly, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court for these proceedings (pursuant to s 38 of the CYPA), for their service and their advice in formulating these dispositional orders.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs","Family Law – Costs – Assessing the quantum of costs payable to a successful self-represented person"],"date":"2025-04-08","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2524 of 2014 (Summons No 2478 and 2743 of 2024)","title":"TPL v TPM","citation":"[2025] SGFC 46","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33190-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband, in person and unrepresented","Kalvinder Kaur D/O Ranjit Singh and Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-05-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>TPL v TPM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> TPL <em>v</em> TPM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33190-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 46</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2524 of 2014 (Summons No 2478 and 2743 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">08 April 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband, in person and unrepresented; Kalvinder Kaur D/O Ranjit Singh and Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> TPL — TPM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Assessing the quantum of costs payable to a successful self-represented person</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">8 April 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my judgment on costs in respect of SUM 2478 and 2743 of 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The divorce between parties had concluded in 2016. Parties returned to court when, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of June 2024, the Wife took out an application <em>vide</em> SUM 1993/2024 (“SUM 1993”) to vary the orders made in respect of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As SUM 1993 wound its way through to a hearing, the Husband took out two applications for discovery and interrogatories in SUMs 2478 and 2743. I heard both applications and granted orders in respect of the Husband’s application. The only outstanding matter left for me to decide was that of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband submits that he should be entitled to costs. In formulating his position on costs, he argues that the court should take into account the fact that he is a practising lawyer. The Husband says that it is only fair to do so to ensure that he is compensated for reasonable costs incurred in the litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In that vein, the Husband provides two bases upon which he has calculated the costs he says he should be entitled to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Basis “A”:</b> a discounted rate of $725 per hour. The discount applied reflects the discount that the Husband normally applies to his fees, and a further 30% discount to reflect the fact that he is not a Singapore qualified lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Husband says he has spent a total of 114.9 hours on both summonses. On this basis, the quantum of costs the Husband says he is entitled to comes up to $83,302.50.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Basis “B”:</b> a discounted rate of S$330 per hour. According to the Husband, this rate takes into account the “actual cost” of participating in this litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband has, in deriving this figure, computed the impact these proceedings has had on his billings. He says that he has spent a total of 114.9 hours on both summonses. The quantum of costs which the Husband says he is entitled to thus comes up to $37,917.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, took the position that there should be no order as to costs. The following reasons were given. First, that it would be prudent to avoid aggravating acrimony between the parties. In support of this argument, counsel not only cited the decision in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), but also pointed to the Husband’s conduct of the litigation where he had also taken out numerous other proceedings against the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Second, that although the Husband is a lawyer, he is still effectively a litigant in person (or self-represented person). According to counsel, this justifies making no order as to costs because, as the court in <em>WSH v WSI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30753-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 40</a> had noted, costs are usually only provided when parties had legal representation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Finally, counsel for the Wife also argued, in the alternative, that if I was minded to order costs in the Husband’s favour, the quantum of such costs should be fixed at $800. This reflects the fact that the Husband had not incurred filing fees in respect of the documents he had submitted. Counsel also cited the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Arokiasamy Steven Joseph (administrator of the estate of Salvin Foster Steven, deceased) and another v Lee Boon Chuan Nelson and others and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30422-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 291</a> (“<em>Arokiasamy</em>”) for the proposition that where litigants-in-person are awarded costs, the costs awarded are “much lower than what would have been awarded as party-and-party costs where the litigant is represented by solicitors”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The starting point when it comes to costs in family proceedings is that costs shall follow the event. Given that the Husband had succeeded in both SUMs 2478 and 2743, in that he had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items pursued in discovery and interrogatories, he is entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Although counsel for the Wife has argued that I should depart from this starting point to minimise acrimony between the parties, I find no basis to do so in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For one, although counsel for the Wife had stated that the acrimony between parties had “caused problems relating to their co-parenting of the children”, this was a bare assertion in their submissions made without references to any evidence contained in the affidavits that had been filed (see <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31690-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 43</a> at [8]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Wife did draw my attention to the various summonses filed by the Husband as evidence of the acrimony between the parties. That said, the mere fact of multiple applications being taken out by one party is not <em>necessarily</em> an indication of deep-seated acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This brings me to the next point – that is the quantum of costs which the Husband is entitled to. The starting point, when it comes to awarding costs to a self-represented person, is Rule 870 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) – that provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Compensatory costs for litigants in person</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">870.  On a taxation of the costs of a litigant in person, such costs as would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred may be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Rule 870 has been interpreted as affording the court the discretion to “allow costs for a litigant in person that would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred” (<em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [81]; see also <em>WXI v WXJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31581-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 31</a> at [66]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this connection, the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney General and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29416-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 52</a> (“<em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>”) provides an example of how the court might assess costs that a self-represented person is entitled. In awarding the self-represented person (“Mah”) costs, the court applied O 59 r 18A of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> which is essentially <em>in pari materia</em> with Rule 870 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In its assessment of the quantum of costs that would reasonably compensate Mah for the time he had spent, the court considered two points. First, how much time did Mah spend on the litigation? Second, to fix an hourly rate that would compensate him for that time spent: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As to the amount of time Mah had spent, the court was of the view that there was no need to produce time sheets – the court was able to use its “own experience of litigation” to estimate the reasonable time spent. In that connection, the court noted that there must be an “objective yardstick of reasonableness” in assessing the amount of time spent: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As to the applicable hourly rate, the court arrived at a figure of $66.66 which was rounded down to $60.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In arriving at this hourly rate, the court took, as its starting point, the scale of costs applicable in the Magistrate’s Court – a typical case involving 2 to 3 days of trial and 3 to 4 days of pre and post-trial work would encompass some 50 hours of work on the part of the lawyer. Costs for such a case would come in at $5,000, and this would result in an hourly rate of $100. To eliminate the profit margin that a lawyer would be entitled to, but not a self-represented person, the court discounted the $100 hourly rate by a third: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19      <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>, however, did not involve a situation where the self-represented person was a practising lawyer who had full conduct of their own case. In this connection, the Husband relies on the case of <em>London Scottish Benefit Society v Chorley</em> [1884] 13 QBD 872 (“<em>Chorley</em>”) for the proposition that he should be entitled to recover “his professional costs” for the legal work he had done on his own case. The Husband also cites the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in <em>Lam Hwa Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v Yang Qiang</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0003.xml')\">[2014] SGCA 3</a> (“<em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>”) which he says implicitly recognises the principle in <em>Chorley</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20      <em>Chorley</em> was a case where the defendants were lawyers who had acted in person. They won, and so, were entitled to costs. The question was whether they were entitled to costs that any other defendant in person was entitled to, or whether they were entitled to costs that a successful defendant who had employed a lawyer could claim (excluding costs for matters such as taking instructions). The plaintiffs objected when the defendants presented their bill of taxation to the master – they argued that that the defendants only ought to be entitled to costs that any other defendant in person was entitled to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The master overruled the objection. A summons to review the master’s taxation was taken out and subsequently dismissed (see <em>London Scottish Benefit Society v Chorley</em> [1884] 12 QBD 452). The case went on to the Court of Appeal where Brett MR, Bowen LJ and Fry LJ dismissed the appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     This was the proposition laid down in <em>Chorley</em>: that a lawyer who acted in person was entitled to the same costs as a litigant who had engaged counsel to act for them, save for those items of costs that are rendered unnecessary (<em>ie</em>, the “costs of instructions and attendances”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The rationale underlying this proposition was to avoid a situation where a lawyer, who was involved in their own personal litigation before the courts, could recover full costs by simply engaging another lawyer to act for them in their own case. As Brett MR noted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It was contended for the plaintiffs that there is no difference as regards the right to costs between a solicitor and an ordinary person; and for the defendants it was contended that the costs of a solicitor, who is party to a suit, ought substantially to be taxed as if he had been acting for a different person. I think neither contention correct. I cannot think that any privilege of a solicitor exists. I am wholly unable to agree to any argument standing upon that footing. I should have thought that a person wrongfully brought into litigation ought to be indemnified against the expenses to which he is unjustly put; but there cannot be a perfect indemnity, because it is impossible to determine how much of the costs is incurred through his own over-anxiety. When an ordinary party to a suit appears for himself, he is not indemnified for loss of time; but when he appears by solicitor, he is entitled to recover for the time expended by the solicitor in the conduct of the suit. When an ordinary litigant appears in person, he is paid only for costs out of pocket. He cannot himself take every step, and very often employs a solicitor to assist him: the remuneration to the solicitor is money paid out of pocket. He has to pay the fees of the court, that is money paid out of pocket; but for loss of time the law will not indemnify him. When, however, we come to the case of a solicitor, the question must be viewed from a different aspect. <b>There are things which a solicitor can do for himself, but also he can employ another solicitor to do them for him; and it would be unadvisable to lay down that he shall not be entitled to ordinary costs if he appears in person, because in that case he would always employ another solicitor.</b> If a solicitor does by his clerk that which might be done by another solicitor, it is a loss of money, and not simply a loss of time, because it is work done by a person who is paid for doing it. It is true, however, to say that the costs of a solicitor appearing in person must be taxed differently from those of an ordinary litigant appearing by a solicitor. The unsuccessful adversary of a solicitor appearing in person cannot be charged for what does not exist, he cannot be charged for the solicitor consulting himself, or instructing himself, or attending upon himself. The true rule seems to be that when a solicitor brings or defends an action in person, he is entitled to the same costs as an ordinary litigant appearing by a solicitor, subject to this restriction, that no costs which are really unnecessary can be recovered. Of this kind are the costs of instructions and attendances. None of the text-books have laid down a different rule from that which I have enunciated, and a uniform practice has not prevailed amongst the masters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Fry LJ made a similar observation:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I think that the conclusion at which we have arrived will be beneficial to the public, <b>because if the rule were otherwise a solicitor who is party to an action would always employ another solicitor, and whenever he is successful he would recover full costs</b>; whereas under the rule of practice laid down by us, a solicitor who sues or defends in person will be entitled, if he is successful, to full costs, subject to certain deductions, of which his unsuccessful opponent will get the benefit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband’s reliance on <em>Chorley</em> does not support his claim for costs on either basis that he has computed (above at [5]). It is clear from the speeches of Brett MR and Fry LJ that one concern was to avoid a situation where a lawyer, who had their own personal litigation before the courts, could claim full costs by simply engaging another counsel to act for them. The practical way of dealing with this was to allow such litigants to claim full costs, but to discount items that had been rendered unnecessary – such as the time expended in taking instructions from a client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even if one applies the rule in <em>Chorley</em>, the Husband would only be entitled to the same costs that he would have recovered, had he engaged a family lawyer to act for him, less any costs rendered unnecessary by the fact that he had acted in person. What this means, in practical terms, is that if the court would have awarded costs of $1,000 to a litigant who was represented in respect of an application for discovery and interrogatories, a quantum <b><em>lower</em></b> than $1000 should be awarded if the litigant were a lawyer who had chosen to represent themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to the Husband’s point, that the Singapore Court of Appeal had, in <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>, implicitly approved “the notion of a self-represented lawyer recovering his costs”, I do not share the same reading of that judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>, the respondent had sought to claim, as disbursements, travel expenses which came up to $1,208. The appellant objected to this claim. Their objections, however, found little weight with the taxing registrar, and the District Judge, and the High Court. The case eventually wound its way to the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Before the Court of Appeal, the appellant cited the decision in <em>Chorley</em>, claiming that it laid down a “general principle of law precluding the recovery of a successful litigant’s travel expenses”: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, noting that the costs regime was governed by a legislative provision which reflected the prevailing policy considerations and societal conditions, and so the decision in <em>Chorley</em>, which was of some vintage, had little bearing on the issue of whether travel expenses could be reasonably claimed as disbursements: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [24]. In any event, a close reading of <em>Chorley</em> revealed that there was a transcribing error – the word “travel” which appears in that judgment was “probably in fact meant to mean trouble” – and so <em>Chorley</em> could not support the proposition that the appellant had contended for: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [25] – [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There is nothing in the passages of <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> which suggest that the Court of Appeal had implicitly endorsed the proposition in <em>Chorley</em>. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal had noted (at [29]) that little weight could be given to precedent from other jurisdictions unless it had been established that the costs framework applicable were <em>in pari materia</em> with our own framework. On that note, I also observe that the principle in <em>Chorley</em> is not a universally accepted one: see the decision of the High Court of Australia in <em>Bell Lawyers Pty Ltd v Pentelow and Another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/cth/HCA/2019/29.html')\">[2019] HCA 29</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, as I have noted above, Rule 870 of the FJR governs the determination of costs, and the General Division of the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> had, in interpreting O 59 r 18A of the ROC 2014 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> with Rule 870 of the FJR 2014), laid down a framework to assess what constitutes reasonable costs. The question was whether this framework in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> should be applied (with or without any modifications) to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Both the Husband, as well as counsel for the Wife were invited to address me, in further written submissions, on this specific point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Counsel for the Wife reiterated their position, that no order as to costs should be made. They also distinguish <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> on the basis that the case was a relatively “complex tort matter concerning wrongful apprehension, false imprisonment and assault and battery, heard in the High Court” whereas both SUMs 2478 and 2743 were merely interlocutory applications heard in the Family Courts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This is, in my view, a distinction without merit – the real issue, which was not addressed, was whether the <em>methodology</em> for assessing costs payable to a self-represented person that had been used in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> was applicable, or could be adapted to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In addition, counsel for the Wife also pointed me to a set of proceedings in the High Court involving the same parties (<em>ie</em>, the Husband and the Wife). The Husband had taken out a discovery application, and prevailed. The Assistant Registrar had fixed costs at $500, despite having claimed $100,000 based on his hourly rate as a solicitor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband had filed an appeal which was dismissed by the High Court. Counsel for the Wife pointed out that the Husband had relied on <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in support of his arguments that he should be entitled to compensate him for the time expended by him on the matter, and that the court should fix an amount to compensate him for that time. The Husband’s appeal was wholly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Insofar as counsel for the Wife had referred to this set of proceedings in the High Court involving both the Husband and the Wife, they had not placed before me, or cited, the reasons as to why the High Court had declined to apply <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in its assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband, on the other hand, takes the position that if one applies the various propositions drawn from <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> to the present case, I should take into account “non-monetary relief and considerations”. As to the considerations that should be accounted for, the Husband urges me to consider factors such as the Wife’s conduct, namely her alleged attempts to exclude him from the sale of their four jointly-owned properties, and the monthly sums that she is claiming in respect of maintenance for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband, however, argued that the “putative restriction” on costs in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> (referring to the 1/3 discount applied to reflect the profit margin that a lawyer is entitled to, but not a self-represented person (see above at [18]) should not apply. He cited the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Arokiasamy</em> at [10] for the proposition that because he had “outperformed [counsel for the Wife] by a significant margin”, it would be “manifestly unjust” to limit his costs to “two thirds of what [a] fumbling counsel” would get.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In <em>Arokiasamy</em>, the court had to deal with the assessment of costs payable to a successful self-represented person. The court observed (at [8] – [11]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8    The claim for costs by the plaintiffs is less straightforward. Traditionally costs were not given to litigants-in-person because such costs are party-and-party costs and awarded to help a litigant defray his solicitor-and-client costs. <b>In modern times, the Rules of Court allow costs to be awarded even to litigants-in-person. In the rare cases where such costs had been awarded, they are much lower than what would have been awarded as party-and-party costs where the litigant is represented by solicitors or counsel.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9    The Civil Procedure Rules in the UK capped costs to litigants-in-person to two thirds of what would have been ordered had the litigant been represented by a lawyer. This appears to have been the formula adopted by the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney-General and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29416-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 52</a> at [7]-[9]. I have no disagreement with the decision of Jeyaretnam J in that case, save to say that <b>it is not appropriate to lay down strict formulae for costs for litigants-in-person for reasons that I shall now elaborate.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    Unlike the Civil Procedure Rules in the UK which provide for capped costs to litigants-in-person, our Rules of Court 2014 (O 59 r 18A) and Rules of Court 2021 (O 21 r 7) do not provide for any cap on quantum. As such, I am of the view that the two thirds cap found in the UK Civil Procedure Rules is, at best, a useful guide. <b>The quantum of costs is always discretionary (as opposed to the principles regarding when costs may be awarded). That is because costs are fact sensitive, and every case is different.</b> When litigants appear in person, matters can get even more complicated because an anxious litigant may labour excessively, often misguiding himself for lack of knowledge of the law. In other cases, the litigant may indeed have knowledge of the law and labour as hard with better results. Conversely, a litigant-in-person may outperform counsel in the case, making it appear manifestly unjust that he should be limited to two thirds of what the fumbling counsel gets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    The point therefore, is that <b>costs of a litigant-in-person should not be taxed separately, but fixed by the trial judge because he is the person who knows the facts and merits required to adjust the discretionary quantification of costs to a litigant-in-person</b>. That court will be guided by the fact that <b>money is rarely adequate compensation even in successful litigation. Neither are costs meant as a punishment to the party who has failed.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is worth noting that the court in <em>Arokiasamy</em> did not follow the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>. In fixing costs at $500, the court took into account the fact that both plaintiffs had to attend court on two or three occasions and that they had produced evidence on affidavit that had assisted the court. Given that neither plaintiff was employed, there was no loss of income to claim as disbursements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the present case, I would decline to follow the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> for two reasons. First, in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>, the court’s starting point, when it came to assessing the hourly rate that a self-represented person was entitled to, was the scale of costs included in Part IV of Appendix 2 to ROC 2014 which provided that in cases before the Magistrate’s Court, where a plaintiff was awarded $20,000, the range of costs to be awarded was $3,000 – $6,000 (excluding disbursements).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     If one looks at the FJR 2014, a set of fixed costs is also provided for certain cases (<em>ie</em>, where summary judgment is obtained) under Part 2 to the Third Schedule of the FJR 2014. These figures are identical to those found in Part 2 of Appendix 2 of the ROC 2014, except that the scale is for the District Court, whereas the figures provided for the same proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court are approximately 1.5 times lower.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     While it may be tempting to apply a multiplier of 1.5 to the hourly rate of $60 in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in order to fix an hourly rate, I would decline to do so. That is because the figures given in Part 2 to the Third Schedule of the FJR 2014 do not appear to cover applications for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     This leads me to my second reason for declining to apply the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>. I consider that adopting such an approach would be counterproductive, especially when one considers the principles of therapeutic justice. Adopting an hourly rate to the computation of costs may well serve to promote acrimonious litigation as parties are incentivised to keep track of the score in terms of the time they had spent on proceedings so that they are in a position to make submissions on costs should they prevail. This would only serve to distract parties from focussing on how they can amicably resolve the dispute, heal, and move on and rebuild their lives in a positive way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Ultimately, costs are in the discretion of the court, and a glance at the costs jurisprudence in the Family Courts demonstrates that weight is typically given to factors such as the conduct of parties (<em>XER v XES</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32715-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 4</a>; <em>WQF v WQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32687-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 113</a> at [23]; <em>XBG v XBH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32214-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 81</a>; see also Tan Hui Qing, “The Role of Conduct in the Award of Maintenance and Costs Orders: <em>WUP v WUQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31102-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 15</a>” [2024] SAL Prac 15 at [21] – [22]), and whether the award of costs would risk worsening the acrimony between the parties (<em>JBB</em>; <em>XHS v XHT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32881-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 20</a> at [91] citing <em>BNH v BNI</em> [2013] 283 at [50] and <em>USC v USD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25671-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 4</a> at [9]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32931-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 15</a> at [141]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Apart from these considerations, I also agree with the proposition in <em>Arokiasamy</em> (at [8]) that costs awarded to a successful self-represented person are typically lower than in cases where the litigant is represented by counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     There is, of course, that scenario as described in <em>Chorley</em>: that lawyers who had their own personal litigation in the courts could simply claim the full quantum of costs by hiring another lawyer to represent them. There are, however, good reasons, at least in the context of family disputes, as to why one might wish to engage the counsel of a member of the Family Bar. For one, it is clear that the practice of family law has developed into a specialised field and the role of the modern family lawyer is not limited to merely resolving disputes, but also “rehabilitating relationships, championing resilience and restoring hope”: Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, “Building Hope, Embracing Change” (Speech delivered at the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Celebration of the Family Justice Courts, 21 October 2024) at paragraph 8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my assessment of costs, I considered the numerous items which the Husband had pursued in respect of his applications for discovery and interrogatories. Given the number of items pursued, it was unsurprising that voluminous sets of documents had been filed, and that two tranches of hearing were needed to dispose of both summonses. This spoke to the time and energy that had been expended on both summonses that would justify a higher quantum of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     There was also one other consideration I gave weight to which merited awarding a lower quantum of costs – and that was the conduct of parties. It was clear to me, from the various documents that had been filed (<em>ie</em>, the correspondence between parties that had been exhibited)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that the Husband had, in his pursuit of both summonses, taken a rather adversarial stance which is not acceptable in our family justice system: see <em>XER v XES</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32715-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 4</a> at [4(c)] citing <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As a final point, I would add that the essence of the Husband’s claim for the sum of roughly $40,000 – $80,000 in costs was to compensate him for his lost income in light of the time and effort he had spent on the litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I do not take the Husband’s lost income into account. The Husband had attached correspondence showing that he had obtained a fee quote from at least one member of the Family Bar. Although that fee quote did not factor in applications for discovery and interrogatories, the point remains that the Husband thus had, available to him, what appeared to be a cost-effective option of handling the dispute that would leave him free to focus on his work. Given that he had chosen not to avail himself of this option, I do not think it now open to him to urge this court to consider his lost income in the assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In light of what I have set out above, costs for both SUMs 2478 and 2743 are fixed at $2,500 (all-in). This sum shall be paid by the Wife to the Husband by 6 May 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at paras 1 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at paras 8 – 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at paras 10 – 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at paras 10 – 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>O 59 r 18A of the ROC 2014 states: “On a taxation of the costs of a litigant in person, there may be allowed such costs as would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Further Written Submissions at para 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Wife’s Further Written Submissions at paras 3 – 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Further Written Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Husband’s Further Written Submissions at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>See for example, Husband’s Affidavit dated 5<sup>th</sup> August 2024 at pp 71 – 72, 153 – 205, 294, 299 – 300.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection"],"date":"2025-04-21","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 201 of 2024","title":"XLD v XLE","citation":"[2025] SGFC 45","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33154-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Hoon Shu Mei and Ms Shannen Leong (Drew & Napier LLC) for the Complainant","Ms Kulvinder Kaur and Ms Kalvinder Kaur (I.R.B.

At the material time, the Child was around 5 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It is not disputed that after SS 201 was filed in February 2024, the Complainant had filed an application on 20 May 2024 to vary the IJ, particularly on the issue of access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Complainant relied on an <em>isolated incident</em> in his Complaint Form that allegedly occurred around Friday, 26 January 2024, whereby he said, in his words, that a “<em>cane alike wound</em>” was spotted on the Child’s right upper arm and that this was caused by the Respondent (“<b>Isolated Incident</b>”). The Complainant claimed that the Child had allegedly stated that “<em>he [was] naughty and Uncle [D] beat him. [D] is his step-father</em>”. He claimed that when the Child’s “<em>school</em>” asked the Child about the alleged wound on Monday, 29 January 2024, the Child had allegedly stated that “<em>Uncle [D]”</em> (the term that the Child used to refer to the Respondent) had beat him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Complainant then filed his first affidavit, where he elaborated on the alleged Isolated Incident. The salient points have been set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant claimed he had picked the Child up from school on 26 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>b.     He claimed that on 27 January 2024, the Complainant’s Mother discovered bruises on the Child’s right upper arm while she was changing him. The Complainant then stated that he understood from his mother that the Child had said that the Respondent had beaten him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Complainant texted the Mother on 28 January 2024. The Mother denied that the Respondent had caused the Child’s bruises. The Complainant also texted the Child’s paternal grandmother, who denied that anyone had hit the Child in the Mother’s residence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Complainant’s Sister and the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend also had an exchange with the Child on what happened to his arm. The Complainant claimed that the Complainant’s Sister informed him that the Child had told her that the Respondent “<em>beat [him]”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>e.     The Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister then brought the Child to visit a doctor where the Child was attended to by Dr S. Dr S expressed that the Child had a <em>“[contusion] of shoulder and upper arm</em>”. Dr S subsequently provided a medical report dated 21 February 2024 (“<b>Medical Report</b>”) stating that the bruises over the Child’s right shoulder could “<em>possibly</em>” represent cane marks<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>f.     Apart from this, the Complainant sent a message to the Child’s school to enquire how the Child got bruises on his arm. The Teacher, namely, one Mdm G, subsequently informed the Complainant that the Child informed her that it was the Respondent who hit him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     After the Complaint Form and Complainant’s first affidavit were filed, it is observed that the Complainant’s counsel made submissions after the event that the Respondent had hit the Child with a cane-like object because the Child had allegedly opened a family member’s room door at night<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Respondent strongly denied the Complainant’s allegations. He claimed that the Complainant had made a false allegation that he had caned the Child. The Respondent’s claims are summarised below<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Respondent’s case was that the Isolated Incident never happened, and he had never hit the Child, be it with his hand or any item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Respondent stated that, on 26 January 2024, the Child had gone to school as per normal and the Mother and the Child’s maternal grandfather had sent him to school. The school had not reported any bruises on the Child. The Child then went to the Complainant’s place for his access session in the evening.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In SS 201, it is observed that the degree of parental conflict between the parties was relatively high, given that it was undisputed that the Complainant had also filed an application relating to the Child’s access after filing SS 201. In addition, the Isolated Incident allegedly occurred when the Child was in the care and control of the Mother. It would thus be apposite to highlight the Court’s observations in the case of <em>WDC v WDD and others</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 58; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27564-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 41</a> at [8]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“In cases where there is high parental conflict with underlying substantive disputes over access (like in the present case), there is a tendency for the parents to point fingers at each other upon discovery of minor injuries on their child. This may often lead to the child being subject to physical examination with every handover for access and the taking of photographic evidence. If there is no family violence or likelihood of family violence, such behaviour is particularly harmful to the child as it brings the child into the direct path of conflict between the parents. As such, it is all the more important to scrutinize the evidence carefully in these cases to determine whether family violence has indeed been committed or is likely to be committed. Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 states that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>65.-</b>(1) The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The law is clear that before a PPO may be granted, two conditions must be satisfied (see section 65 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>WC</b>”); and <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<b><em>UNQ</em></b>”)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against the family member; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, that a PPO is necessary for the protection of that family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The burden is on the Complainant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence has been committed and is likely to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     What constitutes family violence? Under the WC, “<em>family violence</em>” is defined to include the commission of any of the the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>a.     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt (“<b>Limb A</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>b.     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt (“<b>Limb B</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>c.     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>d.     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>e.     but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The protection of a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions. In light of the criminal consequences that follow a breach of a PPO, ordering one is not a decision that the Court would make lightly (<em>UNQ</em> at [28])<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. In <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a>, it was highlighted that at [22]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It bears emphasis that PPOs will not be issued where they are sought to serve a collateral purpose.

In particular, the key issue relates to whether it can be shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the bruises observed on the Child were caused by the Respondent during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>b.     Whether a PPO is necessary to protect the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Whether Family Violence Has Been Committed Or Is Likely To Be Committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The key issue is whether the bruise observed on the Child’s arm had been caused by the Respondent during the material time of the Isolated Incident such that this fell within the scope of the definition of “<em>family violence</em>” under the WC, particularly Limb A and/or Limb B (which the Complainant referred to at page 5 of the Complaint Form).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Having considered the evidence and the submissions, I was unable to find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed against the Child by the Respondent during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident. My reasons are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As a starting point, the Complainant relied on what he claimed <em>he had heard from the Child</em> and what the Witnesses claimed <em>they had heard from the Child</em> to support his argument that the Respondent had allegedly committed family violence against the Child during the material time of the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Complainant submitted that the statements made by the Witnesses on what the Child had allegedly said were admissible under Section 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act 1893 (“<b>EA</b>”) read with Section 120 of the EA. The Complainant’s arguments on this point are summarised below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant highlighted that the Child, who was at the young age of around 5 years old at the material time, had delayed speech development and difficulties in expressing himself. As such, the Complainant argued that the Child was not competent to testify as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>b.     Thus, the Complainant’s submission was that the Child’s statements that had been relayed to the Witnesses were admissible under the EA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Complainant also submitted that the Child’s statements were cogent and buttressed by the fact that the Child repeated this statement multiple times<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     My observations on the Complainant’s arguments are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     First, in respect of the Complainant’s argument that the Child was <em>not</em> competent to testify as a witness, it was difficult to reconcile this argument with the Complainant’s other argument that the Child’s alleged statements were “<em>cogent</em>”. It did not logically flow that the Child’s statements could be relied on as “<em>cogent</em>” statements, when the Complainant was also attempting to argue that the Child was not competent to testify due to the Child’s delayed speech development and difficulties in expressing himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Second, the burden is on the Complainant, who is seeking to rely on section 32(1)(j)(i) of the EA, to prove that the Child was unfit to attend as a witness. While the Complainant cited the case of <em>UUX v UUW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23896-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 137</a> as an example where an application to call a young child as a witness was rejected, I observed from the said case that the District Judge had the benefit of assessing the child’s evidence and demeanour via video-link <em>before</em> making the determination to reject the relevant application at [12]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. In the present case, apart from the lack of opportunity to observe the Child’s demeanour, there was also a lack of evidence provided by the Complainant, such as any medical report, that expressly indicated that the Child was too young or that his mental condition rendered him unable to testify for the Court to make any determinative findings on the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Third, even if I had found that the alleged statements that the Child made were admissible under the EA, due consideration must be given to the <em>weight</em> to be accorded to these alleged statements. On this point, I observed that the Complainant, himself, had expressed concerns that the Child could be coached and/or indirectly pressured. As such, I found it difficult to place much weight, if at all, on the Child’s statements. I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>a.     In the present case, it is observed that the Complainant and the Respondent’s counsel had <em>both</em> tried to cast doubt on the veracity of the statements that the Child had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>b.     As stated above, the Complainant had expressed concerns that the Child could be coached and/or indirectly pressured. In particular, the Complainant had highlighted that when he returned the Child to the Mother on 28 January 2024 (<em>after</em> the Isolated Incident), the Child had initially told the Mother that the Respondent hit him. However, the Complainant said that when the Mother repeated her question to the Child, the Child then claimed that his injuries were caused by a fall. The Complainant then said he was “<em>worried</em>” and “<em>concerned</em>” about the Mother indirectly pressuring the Child to say the “<em>correct</em>” answer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>c.     Furthermore, when the Complainant was asked during cross-examination whether the Child tells “<em>fibs</em>”, he claimed that the Child is “<em>very cheeky</em>” and “<em>does tell white lies at times</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Complainant also did not dispute that he had sent the WhatsApp message exhibited at page 71 of R1 where he affirmed that he had made the following statement in relation to the Child: <em>“I know he lies, and we always tell him not to. If no tell lies, we will give him present.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>e.     In view of the Complainant’s own position that the Child has told lies and the Complainant’s own concerns of the Child’s propensity to be indirectly pressured by his parents, this created doubt as to the veracity of the Child’s statements that were allegedly made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Fourth, apart from the Complainant, it must be reiterated that the Respondent’s counsel had also attempted to cast doubt on the statements the Child had made. This is elaborated upon below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Respondent’s counsel referred to a transcript submitted by the Complainant in C2 where the Child is recorded to have said to the Mother during a call that, “<em>Uncle [D] beat me</em>”, on 3 February 2024 (“<b>Relevant Transcript</b>”). In response, the Respondent’s counsel argued that the Complainant was coaching the Child <em>before</em> the call with the Mother, whereby the Complainant is recorded to have said “<em>Remember ah, mama ask you, want to go mama house, if you say yes papa will send you back. Then Uncle [D], you will see him already ok? If you don’t want to go, you must tell mama don’t want to go mama house.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>b.     In this regard, the Respondent’s counsel raised the point that it was odd that, at the outset, the Child had first said that the Respondent had beat him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>c.     After reviewing the contents of the Relevant Transcript, I observed as a preliminary point that it was unclear <em>who</em> prepared the transcript as there was no certification to be found on the said transcript.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>d.     Nevertheless, even if the Relevant Transcript could be relied upon, it is noted that the transcript related to an event on 4 February 2024 which was around <em>more than a week</em> after the material time that the alleged Isolated Incident was expected to have occurred (i.e. in or around 24 to 26 January 2024, as submitted by the Complainant). Based on the Relevant Transcript, the Complainant’s words to the Child could be construed as a form of coaching on his part where he instructed the Child that he “<em>must tell</em>” the Mother that he did not want to go to the Mother’s house. The prompts provided by the Complainant to the Child cast doubt on the reliability of the Child’s statements, particular the Child’s alleged claim that the Respondent had allegedly beaten him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_e\"></a>e.     Given that the Complainant had his own concerns on the Child’s propensity to be indirectly pressured and given that he appeared to have been coaching the Child himself, I could not rely or place much weight on what the Child allegedly stated from the Relevant Transcript to find that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, the Complainant’s own concerns on the veracity of the Child’s statements cast doubt on all of the claims that the Child had allegedly made to the Complainant and the Witnesses. It was thus difficult to rely on the assertions the Child had made as evidence as to the truth of the contents therein and I could not place much weight, if at all, on such statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     This leads me to the observation that the Complainant’s allegations were largely based were based on hearsay evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The thrust of the Complainant’s claims were premised on what he claimed the Child had allegedly said to him or what the Witnesses told him about what the Child had conveyed to them. As the Complainant <em>himself</em> had doubts as to the veracity of certain statements that the Child had made, it was difficult for me to rely on the Complainant’s statements (which were largely based on what he claimed that he had heard from the Child), to find that he had satisfied the burden of proof that lay on him to demonstrate that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance on probabilities. I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Complainant’s various statements on the Isolated Incident and what occurred thereafter appeared to be inconsistent, as highlighted during the cross-examination. For example, in the Complaint Form, the Complainant stated that he discovered the bruise on the Child on <em>26 January 2024</em>. However, on the stand during the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, he claimed that he had only discovered the bruise on the Child on the morning of <em>27 January 2024</em>. When the Respondent’s counsel asked the Complainant whether he agreed that his version in the Complaint Form differed from the version in his first affidavit, the Complainant confirmed that this was correct<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant had also <em>agreed</em> when the Respondent’s counsel had put it to him that he had mentioned “<em>inconsistent days in the days in the documents</em>” before the Court. In particular, it is also noted that the Complainant did not disagree when the Respondent’s counsel put it to him that he had <em>inconsistent timings</em> in the documents before the Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, the Complainant did <em>not</em> witness the Respondent hit the Child. On the stand, when the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”. When the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had <em>ever</em> seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. As such, it was difficult for me to rely on the Complainant’s account to find that the Respondent had caused the bruises observed on the Child’s arm, when the Complainant had not witnessed what had occurred during the material time of the Isolated Incident and when he had admitted that he had never seen the Respondent hit the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>c.     As the Complainant did not witness what had occurred during the material time of the Isolated Incident, I could not rely on what he claimed the Child told him or what the other Witnesses claimed the Child had told them to make affirmative findings that the Respondent had beaten and/or caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To summarise, in the absence of clear particulars relating to what had transpired during the material time of the Isolated Incident, the inconsistencies in the Complainant’s documents, as well as the lack of clear evidence that the Respondent had beaten and/or hit the Child (given that the Complainant admitted he had never witnessed this before), I could not rely on the Complainant’s statements to find that the Complainant had sufficiently shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I now turn to the Respondent’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Respondent repeatedly denied the Complainant’s allegations. In particular, during cross-examination, the Complainant’s counsel put the following statements to the Respondent, which he disagreed with<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Okay. I put it to you that you had sufficient opportunity that night---on<em>---</em>on---on the days prior to the 27th when [the Child] said that he woke up in the middle of the night and you lost your temper, and you struck him. Agree or disagree?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A     <em>Disagree</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    At 2:00, 3:00, 4:00am, <em>everyone</em> else would have been sleeping, I put it to you that when you hit the child, no one else would have known or no one would have seen because everyone else would have been in bed. Correct or incorrect?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A     <em>Incorrect</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     From the above extract, it would be pertinent to highlight the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Respondent repeatedly denied that he had struck or hit the Child. This was consistent with the position he maintained during the relevant hearings over the course of the trial and in his documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, certain statements that were put to the Respondent by the Complainant’s counsel during cross-examination had <em>not</em> been mentioned in the Complaint Form. For example, under the Complaint Form, the Complainant had <em>not</em> suggested that it was his case that the Respondent had hit the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident in the middle of the night or between “<em>2:00, 3:00, 4:00am</em>”, when everyone else was sleeping (as put by the Complainant’s counsel to the Respondent during cross-examination). Furthermore, it is also noted that it was only in the Complainant’s submissions that it had been suggested that the Respondent hit the Child with a cane-like object for opening his family member’s room door at night. These explanations appear to only have been provided by the Complainant as an afterthought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, even if it were the Complainant’s case that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child in the middle of the night during the material time of the Isolated Incident, I found it unusual that the Complainant’s counsel had suggested that “<em>no one else would have known or no one would have seen</em>”, as there was a high likelihood that the Child would have cried or expressed discomfort if the Respondent had indeed struck or hit the Child, causing the “<em>cane alike</em>” wound that the Complainant had described. Furthermore, the Complainant’s counsel submitted that the Respondent had hit the Child “<em>because he was naughty for opening a door</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. From the said argument, it could only be inferred that the Complainant had been implicitly suggesting that the reason why the Child was naughty for opening the door was that he would be disturbing his family members (resulting in the alleged punishment of the Child). Even if this were the case, this argument did not square with the Complainant’s argument that the rest of the Child’s family members at the Mother’s residence would not have woken up or have been alerted to the Child’s cries if the Respondent had hit the Child in the manner the Complainant suggested in the middle of the night (at a timing that remained unspecified and unclear based on the Complainant’s own case).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d.     Fourth, as stated above, there was a lack of clarity as to what time or on which exact day the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child during the material time of the Isolated Incident, much less other supporting documents or further evidence to corroborate the Complainant’s counsel’s submissions that the Child had been hit between “<em>2:00, 3:00, 4:00am</em>” with a “<em>cane-like</em>” object by the Respondent for opening a door. For example, there was no video or photographic evidence produced to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly struck the Child. The Complainant also did not produce any evidence that the Respondent had a cane, which the Respondent denied possessing. The Complainant had also not made any application to summon the Mother, or the Child’s maternal grandparents, who were allegedly around at the Mother’s residence during the material time of the Isolated Incident, as witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     For completeness, I also considered that the Complainant’s counsel had tried to rely on the following portions of the NE2 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, during the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing to claim that the Respondent had allegedly admitted to hitting the Child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_Q\"></a>Q     <em>[The Mother] does not know you hit [the Child], correct?</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_A\"></a>A     <em>Yes. Um---</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_Q_1\"></a>Q    That’s why she agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to you pending investigations on 29th Jan, <em>correct</em>?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_A_2\"></a>A    Sorry, can you <em>repeat</em> that again?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_Q_3\"></a>Q    That’s why she even agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to [the Complainant] pending investigations on 29th Jan, correct?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_A_4\"></a>A    He hand---she handed over to [the Complainant] because [Complainant] was worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having considered the relevant NEs in totality, I could not rely on the exchange above to find that this amounted to a unequivocal admission by the Respondent that he had hit the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident to arrive at the finding that the Complainant had sufficiently proved that family violence had been committed against the Child, on a balance of probabilities. I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>a.     Having examined the Respondent’s answer (i.e. “<em>yes</em>”) in response to the question, <em>“[the Mother] does not know you hit [the Child], correct?”</em>, it was unclear whether the Respondent had understood or heard the Complainant counsel’s question correctly in the context of the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>b.     In particular, the Respondent had been interrupted while attempting to answer the above question, as evinced by the transcript where he stated (i.e. “Yes. <em>Um—</em>&quot;). On this point, the immediate statement that the Respondent had made after saying “<em>Yes. Um---”</em> was to ask the Complainant’s counsel to repeat her question which related to the alleged hitting of the Child (i.e. “<em>Sorry, can you repeat that again?</em>”). However, in between the two statements, the Complainant’s counsel had asked the Complainant a <em>separate</em> and <em>distinct</em> question (i.e. “<em>That’s why she agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to you pending investigations on 29th Jan, correct?”).</em> In response to the Respondent’s request for the Complainant’s counsel to repeat the question again, the Complainant’s counsel did <em>not</em> repeat the material question (i.e. whether the Mother knew the Respondent had hit the Child) and had only repeated the following “<em>That’s why she even agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to [the Complainant] pending investigations on 29th Jan, correct?”</em>, to which the Respondent then claimed that the Mother had handed the Child to the Complainant because the Complainant was worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>c.     The above exchange created doubt as to whether the Respondent had understood the import of the Complainant’s counsel’s question clearly, especially when he had requested for the question to be repeated to him and the material question had <em>not</em> been repeated. As such, I could not place much weight on the same to find that this had amounted to an unequivocal admission that the Respondent had hit the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, particularly when there was no other incident being relied on by the Complainant to suggest that the Respondent had hit the Child and there was a lack of corroborative evidence to support this finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_d\"></a>d.     For completeness, I also considered that the Respondent had consistently maintained the position in denying that he had ever hit the Child. In particular, the Respondent had maintained from the outset in the ROS that his position was clear in that he had never hit the Child and that the burden was on the Complainant to prove that the Respondent had allegedly “<em>caned</em>” the Child (which the Respondent denied)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, I note that when the Complainant’s counsel had put it to the Respondent that the Mother had suspicions that he caused the Child’s injuries and bruises, the Respondent’s response was that this was “<em>incorrect</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_e\"></a>e.     Given that the above excerpt of the NE2 (particularly, page 106 of NE2) was the only portion of the relevant NEs relied on by the Complainant’s counsel at paragraph 18 of CS to assert that the Respondent had admitted to hitting the Child, it was difficult to rely on the singular exchange (set out above) to find that the Respondent had clearly admitted to hitting the Child during the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As such, I could not rely on the above to find that the Complainant had sufficiently proved that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. The Complainant had also failed to clearly rebut the Respondent’s claims during the trial, given that there was a lack of objective evidence to support the allegation that it was the Respondent who hit the Child, such as <em>when</em> the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child or <em>what</em> the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Letter of Warning</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I turn to address the Complainant’s argument that the Respondent had admitted in cross-examination that a letter of warning had been issued to him by the Singapore Police Force (“<b>SPF</b>”) on 8 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The essence of the Complainant’s argument was that Respondent’s admission that he had been administered a warning by the SPF lends weight to the Complainant’s claim that the Respondent caused the Child’s injuries<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Having considered the above, while the Respondent had been issued with a letter of warning from the SPF, the Complainant did not show how the letter of warning could be relied upon for the Court to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. This is especially since the Court of Appeal had affirmed in the case of <em>Teo Seng Tiong v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26218-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 65</a> at [82] to [88] that stern warnings, whether conditional or not, have no legal effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant’s Sister, Complainant’s Mother and Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I then turned to consider the statements made by the Complainant’s family members, as well as the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On balance, the statements made by the Complainant’s family members created even more uncertainty as whether the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I elaborate on this below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     First, the Complainant’s Sister’s statements were <em>not</em> consistent as to how the Respondent had allegedly caused the bruise on the Child. In particular:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant’s Sister was <em>not</em> present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Complainant’s Sister claimed that the Child had informed her that the Respondent had beat him. The Complainant’s Sister claimed that the Child first told her that the Respondent used a “<em>toy</em>”. However, it seemed that the Child later suggested that the Respondent had used a “<em>line</em>”. These alleged statements made by the Child created confusion as to how the bruise had been allegedly caused by the Respondent (e.g. had the Respondent hit the Child with an alleged “<em>line</em>” or a “<em>toy</em>”?). As such, I could not rely on these purported statements to find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, as there was a lack of certainty on how the bruises developed on the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>c.     Critically, there was a lack of objective corroborative evidence provided by the Complainant or the Complainant’s Sister to demonstrate the type of object that was allegedly used by the Respondent to cause the bruise observed on the Child. This is bearing in mind that it is unclear what a “<em>line</em>” or a “<em>toy</em>” referred to. If the Complainant or his sister were claiming that the Respondent had used a cane to hit him, it was unusual as to why a Child would refer to a cane as a “<em>toy</em>”. This has not been clearly explained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_d\"></a>d.     For completeness, I had also considered that the Complainant’s Sister had filed a Police Report No.: L/20240127/7046 (“<b>Police Report</b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. However, I could not place much weight on the said Police Report. Of note, the Complainant’s Sister claimed that she had prepared the <em>draft</em> Police Report to be filed but she had held back on making the relevant report while the Complainant was talking to the Mother. In particular, she mentioned that she had submitted the police report upon the Complainant’s instructions. She also stated that the Complainant had “<em>made [her]…submit the draft</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. As the Complainant’s Sister’s account in the said report was based on what the Child had allegedly informed her and she was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, I was unable to attribute much weight to the statements that had been made in the said Police Report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Second, the Complainant’s Mother’s statements were also not consistent. In particular:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>a.     I would first set out that the Complainant’s Mother was also <em>not</em> present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child. She expressly confirmed on the stand that her evidence was based purely on what the Child had told her whereby she claimed that the Child had said that the Respondent beat him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>b.     In addition, her testimony on the stand as to <em>when</em> she had noticed the bruise on the Child was inconsistent whereby she initially claimed that this was on <em>26 January 2024</em>, but subsequently claimed that this was on <em>27<sup></sup>January 2024</em>, during cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>c.     As such, it was also difficult to rely on the Complainant’s Mother’s testimony to find that the Complainant had satisfied the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that it was the Respondent who had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Third, in respect of the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend, I could not place any weight on his testimony as he confirmed on the stand that he was <em>not</em> present when the Complainant’s Mother discovered the bruise on the Child. He also confirmed that he had never seen the Respondent hitting the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In view of the above, I could place much weight, if at all, on the statements made by the Complainant’s Witnesses, particularly, his relevant family members, bearing in mind that none of them had been present during the alleged material time of the Isolated Incident. Their statements were also largely premised on what they claimed the Child conveyed to them. As demonstrated above, given the Complainant’s concerns on the veracity of the Child’s statements, I could not place much weight, if at all, on the claims the Child had allegedly made to the said Witnesses. For completeness, I also had doubts as to the objectivity of observations or statements made by the Complainant’s family members and the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend against the Respondent due to the high-conflict nature of the present dispute and the acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant Doctors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Complainant also called two doctors as witnesses to testify in this matter. The first doctor being Dr S and the second doctor being Dr P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Dr S’s claims are summarised below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant highlighted that Dr S testified that bruises on the Child could possibly represent cane marks. Dr S also claimed that based on photos that were taken of the Child’s bruises, the bruises were between 0 to 3 days old<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant used this opinion to highlight that, on 24 to 26 January 2024, the Child was in the Mother’s care, before the Complainant had access to the Child after school on 26 January 2024, and that this pointed to the fact that the injuries <em>could have</em> been inflicted during this period. Specifically, the Complainant relied on Dr S’s testimony to claim that the relevant injuries were inflicted on the Child “<em>on or around 24 January 2024</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>b.     When cross-examined on the Child’s bruise, it is noted that Dr S had stated the following<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“<em>[It] is plausible that the bruise could have been caused by hitting something</em>. However, let me state that that in the absence of any tenderness around the wound, it is much more likely that a light object struck him rather than he hit an object with a force of his body. This is because when you hit---well, when a person hits and object with a force of the body, then there is the weight, the mass and therefore, the energy behind that body that tends to cause more swelling and tenderness.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While Dr S raised the probability that it was likely that the Child’s bruise was caused by a light object that struck him, I could not rely on this claim to find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the bruise had been caused by the Respondent. I had to consider Dr S’s statements in the context of the totality of the evidence in the case. I elaborate on my reasons below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, Dr S, like the rest of the Witnesses, had <em>not</em> been present during the material time of the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence to demonstrate <em>what</em> or <em>who</em> had caused the Child’s bruise. Dr S himself had claimed that it was <em>plausible</em> that the Child’s bruise could have been caused by the Child “<em>hitting something</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. However, he also further confirmed on the stand that he could <em>not</em> definitively say that the bruise was caused by a cane. As such, where Dr S could <em>not</em> confirm that the bruise observed on the Child was caused by a cane, it was difficult to see how the Complainant could show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, as for Dr S’s claim that the bruises were about 0 to 3 days old around 27 January 2024, I was hard pressed to see how the Complainant could argue that this meant that the Respondent had definitively caused the bruises on the Child. It was difficult to see how the Complainant arrived at the assumption that the Respondent had hit the Child on this basis alone, when Dr S could <em>not</em> comment with any certainty on the exact date where the bruises had begun to develop, much less show that the alleged bruise had been caused during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>d.     Fourth, Dr S had raised the possibility that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something, and it is noted that the Complainant expressly confirmed that the Child was also at school on 26 January 2024 during the window of the period where Dr S opined the bruise could have been caused (i.e. that the “<em>bruises were between 0 to 3 days old</em>” based on the photos on 27 January 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>). As such, I could not rely on Dr S’s claims to find that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child due to the lack of certainty as to <em>when</em> the bruise was caused and <em>where</em> the bruise had been caused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_e\"></a>e.     Fifth, as the Respondent’s counsel had highlighted, Dr S had also confirmed on the stand during cross-examination that he had relied solely on the information from the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister in his affidavit and that he had <em>not</em> conducted an independent assessment to verify the claims provided by them<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. As such, given that Dr S was not present during the material time of the Isolated Incident, coupled with the fact that he had relied on the self-reports made by the Complainant and Complainant’s Sister as part of the basis in which he formed his opinion, I could not rely on these statements to arrive at a finding that it was the Respondent who had allegedly hit the Child during the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Next, I considered Dr P’s testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In particular, Dr P claimed that there was “<em>suspected abuse</em>” in relation to the Child. In this regard, it was difficult for me to place much reliance on Dr P’s testimony to find that the Complainant had sufficiently shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, Dr P was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, Dr P had confirmed that she was <em>not</em> the one who had the “<em>suspected</em>” that the Child had been abused<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. When she was questioned as to why she used the term “<em>suspected abuse</em>” in relation to the Child on 2 March 2024, she claimed that this was based on a referring memo where the reasons and circumstances were described to her by Dr S, as well as what the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had described.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, insofar as Dr P had relied on Dr S’s description of the circumstances, Dr S had based this on what the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had informed him. As mentioned above, the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had <em>not</em> been present at the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident. As such, I could not place much weight on Dr P’s testimony to find that the Child had been the subject of “<em>suspected abuse</em>” or that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>d.     In sum, it was difficult to rely on Dr P’s statements to find that the Complainant had satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed by the Respondent against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the above, I could not find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. As it stands, most of the views and opinions that were expressed by Dr S and Dr P were predominantly based on “<em>self-reports</em>” made by the Complainant and his family members. As such, their views could not be relied upon to prove that family violence had been committed by the Respondent against the Child. As set out above, Dr P admitted that her report was based on Dr S’s description, which was based on self-reporting. Insofar as the doctors relied on the claims of the Complainant and his family members when preparing the reports, it was difficult to rely on the said reports as independent and objective means to verify the Complainant’s claims that the Respondent had allegedly committed family violence against the Child. This is especially since there was a lack of certainty as to the date on which the Child had allegedly been hit. There was also a lack of documentary evidence to show that the Respondent had hit the Child, much less what type of object had been used by the Respondent. For completeness, based on the pictures provided by the Complainant relating to the bruise that had been observed on the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, it was also difficult to rely on such pictures alone to find that it was the Respondent who had hit or caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Furthermore, even though Dr S had highlighted that the bruises of the Child <em>could</em> represent cane marks, this could not be relied upon alone to find that the Respondent had caused the bruises on the Child, as Dr S had also raised the <em>plausibility</em> that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Teacher</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     This leads me to the Teacher’s account, whereby the Teacher conveyed that the Child said to her that the Respondent had beat him. I could not accord much weight to the Teacher’s statements as the Teacher did <em>not</em> witness the alleged Isolated Incident. Moreover, the Teacher raised further <em>possibilities</em> on how the Child could have developed the bruise:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Teacher highlighted the possibility that the Child could have sustained the relevant bruise in school. In particular, when the Teacher was asked during cross-examination whether it was common for young boys of the Child’s age to hit things and injure themselves, she claimed that “<em>it also happens</em>” and that she “<em>couldn’t say that it’s not a possibility that [it happened] in school</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Teacher’s statement during cross-examination was also consistent with her statement in her affidavit that she <em>“could not rule out the possibility that the [Child’s] injury was sustained in school</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, while the Teacher stated in her affidavit that she was “<em>more inclined towards believing the [Child’s] version of events</em>”, I could not place much weight on her opinion as the Teacher was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident and she did not show why the Child’s version of the events should be relied on to arrive at a finding that the Respondent had hit the Child during the alleged Isolated Incident. This is also bearing in mind that the Complainant had raised doubts as to the veracity of the statements that the Child had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>c.     In view of the above, I could not rely on the Teacher’s Statement to find that the Complainant had satisfied the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. This is also in consideration that the Teacher had raised the <em>alternative possibility</em> that the Child’s injury could have occurred at school, coupled with the fact that Dr S had also raised the <em>plausibility</em> that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Having considered the testimonies and evidence of the Complainant and the Witnesses, I could not find that the Complainant had proved that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Likelihood</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It remains for me to consider whether there is any likelihood of family violence being committed against the Child by the Respondent. After considering the allegations raised by the Complainant in the Complaint Form and in C1, I was unable to find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed against the Child or that family violence was likely to be committed against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Prior to the Isolated Incident, it is noted that when the Complainant was questioned on whether the Child had ever said that the Respondent had hit him between December 2022 to January 2024, the Complainant said that there was <em>no incident</em> he could remember<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>. For completeness, I also considered his claim that, prior to the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, the Complainant and the Mother had a largely harmonious co-parenting relationship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As there was a lack of evidence that the Respondent had hit the Child or that he had a propensity to commit family violence, I could not find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence would likely be committed by the Respondent against the Child, particularly under Limb A and/or Limb B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As the Complainant had not satisfied the legal burden of proving that family violence had been committed or was likely to be committed against the Child, it would follow that a PPO would not be necessary in this case. In any event, it would have been difficult to arrive at a finding that a PPO was necessary in this case for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, during the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearings, it was not disputed that the Child continued to stay with the Mother and Respondent at the Mother’s residence. It is also observed that there were also other family members present at the residence, particularly, the Child’s maternal grandparents who also lived with him. The Complainant had not clearly established that the Mother or the Child’s maternal grandparents could not be relied upon to ensure that the Child was safe. For completeness, I note that the Complainant also continued to have access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, apart from the lack of evidence adduced by the Complainant to prove that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, it must be stressed that the Complainant’s allegations related to a single instance where the bruises had been spotted on the Child to form the basis of his complaint in the Complaint Form. As stated above, when the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”. When the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had <em>ever</em> seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. As such, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that a PPO was necessary to restrain the Respondent from committing family violence in the future against the Child, when the Complainant had not witnessed the Respondent hit the Child and in view of the lack of evidence to corroborate the finding that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In the circumstances, I was unable to grant the Complainant’s application in SS 201.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     On the issue of costs, the Respondent’s counsel submitted that the sum of $25,000 should be ordered in favour of the Respondent. Broadly speaking, she submitted that there were several witnesses on the Complainant’s end who had mostly filed substantive affidavits with transcripts and recordings. In addition, she highlighted that there were supplementary affidavits filed on the first day of the trial, whereby the trial had to be heard in two tranches, with opening statements and written closing submissions that had been submitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In brief, the Complainant’s counsel submitted that costs of $7,000 would be more appropriate in the present case where the trial was over two days and there were co-parenting issues between the parties. The Complainant’s counsel also asked that the Complainant be allowed to pay any such costs over the course of six months due to his cash flow issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Given that the Complainant had not succeeded in his application, the Respondent would ordinarily be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Having considered the submissions of both parties, the number of affidavits filed, the fact that further affidavits were produced by the Complainant during the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, the fact that a reply affidavit had to further be directed on the Respondent’s part, the written submissions, the relevant opening statements, the number of authorities filed by both parties, as well as the number of witnesses and court attendances for SS 201, the Complainant was ordered to pay costs of $12,000 (all-in), in monthly instalments of $2,000 over the course of six months commencing from 23 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Going forward, the reality is that the parties would need to continue to journey together in co-parenting the Child. I observe that the Child is deeply loved by his family and has a strong eco-system, with a caring immediate and extended family (e.g. his grandparents, aunts, etc.). I strongly encourage parties to draw on their love for the Child to work on showing kindness and grace to each other for the sake of the Child’s well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     It is my sincere hope that the harmonious co-parenting relationship that the Complainant had claimed he shared with the Mother will be restored. It is difficult for children to be caught in the middle of parental conflicts, and I would encourage all parties to explore counselling on how to communicate and co-parent in the best interests of the Child.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 3 of ROS.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 23 of R1.

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       In the present application, ie. FC/SUM 587/2024 (“SUM 587”), the defendant-father (“Father”), seeks <em>inter alia</em> the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that he be granted regular weekly access to the parties’ 2 children, [M] and [E] (collectively, the “Children”) from Thursdays 5.00pm to Sundays, 9.00am;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that he be granted access to the Children for half of their mid-year and end-year holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     various other orders relating to public holiday access and overseas travel arrangements for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In essence, the Father’s case is that he should be entitled to 50% (or an equal “split”) of the Children’s time. That broadly reflects what he is seeking through SUM 587. His counsel submits that even as early as October 2023 (before divorce proceedings were actually commenced), both parents had an understanding that they should have equal time with the Children, and that there were no safety and/or other concerns which justifies any deviation from this understanding.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Plaintiff-mother (“Mother”) challenges the Father’s application. The Mother’s position is that she is already providing access to the Father and that these arrangements should continue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Mother – through her counsel – argues that the current arrangement already reflects, broadly, a 50/50 split of the Children’s available time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       To complete the picture of the applicable procedural posture, SUM 587 is an interlocutory application filed in FC/D 5772/2023, which are the ongoing divorce proceedings between the same parties. These divorce proceedings remain pending as both parties having filed a claim and a counterclaim praying for a divorce to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given the various allegations raised by the parties, including the Mother’s concerns with possible use of illicit drugs and the Father’s ability to care for the Children, I found it useful for a Custody/Access Evaluation Report (“Report”) to be prepared by the appointed agency to assist the Court in making the determination on the appropriate access arrangements for the Children. I therefore gave the relevant directions at the first hearing of SUM 587 in October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       For the interim period (pending the final disposal of SUM 587), I also made various orders on 9 October 2024 to provide for a more structured and clear access plan for the Father so that both parties and the Children are clear as to when they would see the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Report has since been prepared in February 2025 and I have considered its contents in deciding the appropriate access arrangements to be made in SUM 587. I delivered my brief decision, in writing, to the parties in March 2025, pursuant to r. 670 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I set out my grounds of decision below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Before I address the substantive orders which I made in the present case, I find it necessary to make several observations as to how the parties (and their counsel) have conducted this matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Arising from the differences in perspectives between the parents, both parties’ arguments and submissions descended into rather technical (and often unnecessary) disputes. These arguments tended to obfuscate more than they illuminate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For example, the parties argued over whether they had in fact adhered to the alleged understanding where the Father would be given an equal split of the Children’s time. The Father says that he should be given half of all available time whereas the Mother believes that only the Children’s “free” time (which excludes the Children’s “down-time”, activity time, etc.) should be divided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, these arguments are unduly technical and borders on inane. Arguing over whether extra-curricular or activity time should be included misses the larger point which is that the <em>purpose</em> of access time is to enable the access (or visiting) parent to build a bond and establish a relationship with his or her child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Thus, fighting over whether which parent should have parenting time during the hours when a school-going child is in school (or engaged in school activities) may well be a fight over who should be standing outside a school or classroom to await their dismissal. It is an unnecessary, and ultimately pointless, fight. On the other hand, if one becomes overly prescriptive, attempting to carve out every possible “activity” time (or impose requirements as to when and where a child should eat, sleep or play) to incorporate as part of an access order, the ensuing order becomes one where the Court would be effectively carving a child’s life up into blocks of hours and minutes. Such an overly prescriptive access order (which <em>is</em> an enforceable and binding court order) unduly restricts <em>both</em> the parents’ and the children’s lives. It also misses the forest for the trees as the true purpose of an access order is to allow one parent to maintain regular contact with the Children: see <em>BG v BF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0233.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 233</a> at [11].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Ultimately, it is incumbent on the parents – being the adults – to act in a practical, sensible and fair manner to ensure that the Children spend sufficient time with <em>both</em> of them and to allow the Children to enjoy the love and attention which both parents want to give.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This leads me to the next, and equally important point – the law places an expectation that each parent endeavour to be the bigger and kinder parent for their child. This, as the High Court (Family Division) in <em>VDX v VDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25522-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 2</a> (at [42]) had observed, means that parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">should strive hard not to mire the family, including the children, in litigation, nor should their resources and the court’s resources be spent on litigation to deal with an emotionally-driven conflict. This will involve some measure of compromise; it may involve being bigger, wiser and kinder – which must be difficult when relationship have broken down, yet this is the legal responsibility placed on all parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the present case, it was apparent from the parties’ affidavits and submissions that there are serious trust issues between both parents. This, however, should not be a reason for them to engage in arguments which appeals to emotions rather than facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To illustrate, the Mother advanced arguments about the alleged danger which the Father might pose to the Children. While some concerns may arise from her genuinely held beliefs, many were wholly speculative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For example, unfortunate arguments revolving the possible use of firearms and/or exposure to gun violence were made by the Mother, through her counsel. The picture which counsel sought to paint was one where the Father is a dangerous gun owner in the United States of America (“US”) – where he grew up with his adoptive family – and that he poses a security risk to the Children given the prevalence of gun-related violence or the accidental discharge of firearms in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Indeed, during oral submissions, the Father was alleged to have engaged in some form of linguistic sophistry when he stated in his affidavit that “[he does] <em>not currently own and/or possess any guns in the US</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Court was then urged to interpret his statement as a tacit acknowledgment that he may own firearms “elsewhere” in the world.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Respectfully, these claims were largely hyperbole and not based on any actual, tangible or even admissible evidence. The Mother did not provide any proof of the Father’s alleged gun ownership. Moreover, I accept the Defendant’s counsel’s submission that to “investigate” into the matter would be to pit father against daughter as the Mother’s entire basis for raising this alleged concern arose from what were clearly hearsay statements allegedly made by 7-year-old [M] in passing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     That is not conducive to effective co-parenting nor is that reflective of a Therapeutic Justice (“TJ”) mindset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Another example relates to the Father’s alleged consumption of drug substances in the US (where the Father submits is a lawful act). Once again, the Mother attempted to paint the Father as a substance abuser who may put the Children at risk. Yet, there is no tangible evidence that the Father consumed illicit drugs in the Children’s presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     These allegations led to various exchanges between counsel, during the hearing of SUM 587, on politically sensitive (and divisive) issues such as gun ownership, drug abuse and the apparent clash of Western and Asian cultures or values. These exchanges similarly shed little light on the actual issue at hand, <em>viz.</em> what should be the appropriate access orders <em>in this case</em> for <em>this family</em> now that the Children are living in Singapore (a place where neither guns nor recreational drugs are allowed).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As the parties continue along their journey through their ongoing divorce proceedings, I encourage both of them and their counsel to avoid making broad or sweeping allegations against one another. The High Court (Family Division) in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (at [26] – [28]) reminds us that an adversarial approach (instead of a problem-solving one) undermines TJ, and that a TJ system “<em>involves parties making what they may perceive to be ‘sacrifices’ – letting go of what has hurt them deeply, refraining from doing ‘inflammatory’ acts against the other party, compromising by giving in and co-operating with the other party in some issues, taking responsibility where required and finding the will to recast the future.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Speaking extra-judicially, Justice Teh Hwee Hwee (in delivering Her Honour’s keynote address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 at the Family Conference 2024) noted that TJ has been explicitly adopted by the Singapore courts and that “[o]<em>ur family justice system aims to help parties and their children heal, enabling them to move forward with their lives despite the breakdown of the marital relationship. </em><b><em>It is a non-adversarial, problem-solving system that allows time for grieving and supports healing, restoration, and the recasting of a positive future</em></b>. [Emphasis added]”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     More recently, the Family Justice Courts (“FJC”) have launched the <em>Family Justice Courts Therapeutic Justice Model</em> (“TJ Model”) in October 2024. The TJ Model, read in conjunction with the FJC’s Practice Directions 2024, requires parties to court proceedings (and their lawyers) to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the principles set out therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Part 3 of the TJ Model reminds parties that they “<em>play a central role in the TJ Model. They are to take ownership of the family’s issues and cooperate with each other to find timely and enduring solutions to these issues. Particularly where children are involved, they are to prioritise the welfare of the children above their own and focus on parties’ shared interests and future. This involves being willing to compromise in the spirit of give and take and carrying out agreed or ordered arrangements with a cooperative spirit</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Parties are therefore expected to “[a]<em>dopt a cooperative and constructive approach to find timely and enduring solutions; and resolve disputes as amicably as possible</em>” and “[u]<em>se respectful and constructive language in correspondence, court documents and courtroom communications</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     These principles should be borne in the parties’ minds as they navigate their divorce and, more importantly, when implementing the access orders made by the Court in the present application, or in the eventual ancillary matters orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I now move on to the substantive issue – <em>ie.</em> what access orders should be made in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is trite law that when making orders in respect of the custody or the upbringing of children, the Court’s first and <em>paramount</em> consideration is that of the children’s welfare. That is clearly set out in s 125(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal in <em>BNS v BNT</em> [2015] 3 SLR 373 (at [19]) emphasised that this principle ought to override any other consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     When considering what is in a child’s welfare (which ought to be understood in the widest sense),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> regard may be had to the various factors including <em>inter alia</em>, the need for stability, continuity of living arrangements, the need for both parents’ to be involved in a child’s life, the maternal bond, and the desirability of keeping siblings together: see <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (at [20] – [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I wish to make two more observations in relation to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     First, SUM 587 is framed as an application for access orders <em>only</em> and thus it is not necessary for the Court to make orders for the Children’s care and control. That said, it is clear that the Mother currently has <em>de facto</em> care and control of the Children. This is a state of affairs which I find to be appropriate for the Children at present, and nothing in my order should be taken as changing this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Second, a significant part of the Father’s case rests on the existence of an alleged Contact Time Agreement (or “CTA”) where parties had “<em>entered</em>” into in or around 19 October 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father submits that this CTA grants him the unequivocal right to have an equal split of the Children’s total time, which the Mother disagrees with, thus giving rise to the dispute referred to at [10] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     While the CTA may be relevant as an expression of one or both parties’ broad intent on the issue of custody and access, it is by no means determinative or dispositive. Section 129 of the WC expressly states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreement for custody, etc.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">129.  The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the custody, or the care and control, of a child, regardless when the agreement was made, despite any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The purport of this provision is clear – while parents may agree to how a child should be cared for, it is the child’s welfare which should be paramount. Where the terms of the agreement may no longer be suitable, the Court retains the discretion to make the appropriate orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Moreover, insofar as the Father seeks to argue that the CTA is clear with regard to how the Children’s access time should be apportioned between both parents, I do not agree with his submission. In my view, the CTA – which was, in truth, an exchange of text messages between the parents about the impending divorce – was less of a definitive agreement but a generalised idea of what the Father wanted if the Mother proceeds with divorce proceedings, to which the Mother broadly acknowledged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Ultimately, the Court must have regard to the overall circumstances of the case when deciding the appropriate access orders for the Children, and that includes the contents of the Report which was prepared (and which I found to be highly relevant).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     As the Court of Appeal had observed in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<em>WKM</em>”) at [74]: “[i]<em>n the process of generating their reports, the professionals would have engaged directly with the relevant persons involved in the child’s life and observed some of their interactions with the child. </em><b><em>Their observations serve as crucial insights into the child’s world and greatly assist the court by presenting the realities of the child’s situation</em></b><em>. Given their expertise, they are well suited to identify issues, such as excessive gatekeeping behaviour by the parents and even possible signs of abuse</em>…[Emphasis added]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In the present case, the evaluator had the opportunity to speak with the [M]’s primary school teacher, [M]’s psychologist, and [E]’s preschool principal as well as both parents and the Children. These interactions provided invaluable insights which were immensely relevant and helpful to the Court’s determination of the disputed access issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The evaluator’s observations are consistent with my findings on the evidence presented to the Court through the parties’ affidavits, including <em>inter alia</em> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother has been the children’s primary caregiver and can continue in this role with the support network she has in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> She continues to be the Children’s care parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Although the Father’s private life (including concerns about possible recreational drug use overseas) may have form a central aspect of the Mother’s worries,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I do not find that his private life has affected his ability to provide care for the Children <em>in Singapore</em>. For example, the Mother has not provided any evidence that the Father had engaged in recreational drug use which rendered him in a stupefied state or have caused him to act in a manner which rendered him a danger to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Both Children are bright, intelligent, and are performing well in school. Both siblings share a close bond and relationship, and I find it desirable and important that both sister and brother continue to provide support for each other, wherever possible, including when they are with the Father during his access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also find that the Children share a good relationship with <em>both</em> parents despite the trying time for the family, and that this is heartening. Efforts should continue to be made to ensure that the Children’s relationship with both parents remain strong post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     With these broad observations and findings in mind, I set out below my specific orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Pending the full and final disposal of ancillary matters in respect of FC/D 5772/2023 (including any appeals in relation thereto), the Defendant shall have access to the Children as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>School Term Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>During [M]’s school term, the Defendant shall have access every Thursday, from 5.30pm to 8.30pm.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>The Defendant shall have overnight access as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>For the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> week of every month, the Defendant shall have overnight access from Friday, 5.30pm to Saturday 6pm;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>For the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> week of every month, the Defendant shall have overnight access from Friday, 5.30pm to Sunday 10am.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>School Holiday Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>During [M]’s primary school holiday period in March and September each year, the Defendant shall have access to the Children:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>for the second half of the holiday period from 12 noon on Thursday to 6pm on Saturday for the school holiday in March; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>for the first half of the school holiday period from 6 pm on Saturday to 12 noon on Thursday for the school holiday in September.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>For [M]’s June and December school holidays, the Defendant shall have access to both the Children for the first half of school holidays on odd numbered years (eg. 2025, 2027, 2029) and the second half of the school holidays on even numbered years (eg. 2026, 2028, etc.) (“Holiday Access Period”).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>e</em>)     <em>During the Holiday Access Period:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>the Defendant shall have overnight access from 9am every Thursday to 9am on Sunday; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>regular (non-overnight access) on Mondays to Wednesdays, from 9am to 7.30pm.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iii</em>)    <em>The Defendant shall not bring the Children overseas during the Holiday Access Period unless the Plaintiff consents to the said travel arrangements, or by Order of Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>Public Holiday Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>f</em>)     <em>The Defendant shall have access to the Children on gazetted public holidays or special holidays/events as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>For the holiday known as “Thanksgiving” celebrated in the United States of America, the Defendant shall have access to the Children from 9am to 7pm on the eve, and actual day, of the Thanksgiving holiday with the Defendant.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>For the Chinese New Year (“CNY”) holiday period (as celebrated in Singapore), the Children would spend the eve and CNY Day 1 with the Plaintiff.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iii</em>)    <em>The Defendant shall have access to the Children from 9am to 7.30pm on :</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(<em>A</em>)     <em>Christmas eve every odd-numbered year (eg. 2025, 2027, 2029); and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(<em>B</em>)     <em>Christmas day on even-numbered years (eg. 2026, 2028, etc.).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iv</em>)    <em>Save as set out above, the Defendant shall have access to the Children on alternate gazetted public holidays from 9 am to 7.30pm.

This is important and serves as a signal to the parties that the conversation over what would be the best access arrangements for the Children and the Father does not end with these orders. Instead, the parties should continue to discuss these matters as co-parents using these orders as a catalyst. It is also for this reason that I have provided a mechanism for the parties to adjust or change these arrangements by mutual consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For now, I have provided that there shall be no overseas travel with the Children during the Father’s access time. To be clear, and as set out above,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I make this order <em>not</em> because I find the Father to be a security threat to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Rather, save for a single trip to the US with [M] a few years ago, the evidence suggests that the Father has not travelled with the Children alone. As I have found it in the Children’s best interests for both sister and brother to be together during access (where possible), extended periods of overseas travel with <em>both</em> Children should be a matter which both parents should continue to discuss and consider as they move on with the present proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I should add that any such further travel arrangements should take into account the Children’s readiness for extended travel and the Father’s plans as to how care would be provided to them. In so doing, the views of [M] and/or her psychologist should also be considered, where appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     As for the regular access arrangements, in making these orders, I have – where possible provided the Father with a significant amount access time to provide the Children ample opportunity to bond with their father. I have also considered what both parents had informed the evaluator as being their proposed access plans, including weekly and public holiday access hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In some cases, such as the Children’s school holidays and public holidays, I have provided for the Father to have about half of the relevant access period (in terms of calendar days or months). This is not because I am enforcing the terms of the so-called CTA (as put forward by the Father and his counsel) nor is a 50/50 split some default position used by the Court. Rather, it is a recognition that where the Children’s time and schedule permits, it is in their interest to spend quality time with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I wish to reinforce one point – just as I had reminded the Mother not to descend into the minutiae of the Children’s schedule or the allocation of their “free time”, the Father should not be overly fixated with there being some form of overarching concept of “fairness” mandating a 50/50 split in the Children’s time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Father seeks to highlight how the Mother had sought to “commoditised” the Children’s time by requiring make-up time, or extra hours with the Children as something to be traded and/or negotiated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> However, splitting the Children’s time and/or schedule mechanistically to achieve an “equal” division will invariably result in the same commoditisation of the Children’s lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I thus encourage the Father to use the access time he has with the Children (which is generous) in a manner which builds their relationship through father-child activities and interactions. As I had noted above, there is no real purpose of having an allocated “access” time where the parent is merely engaged in passive acts, such as waiting. The focus should be on <em>quality</em>, not quantity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In a similar vein, I note that both [E] and [M] have additional classes and activities over their regular school curriculum. These may sometimes affect how much quality time each parent has, and an overly mechanistic allocation may affect the Children. For example, the Children’s Chinese and/or tennis class schedule have resulted in some challenges with the Father’s pick-up and return schedules. These are matters which the Mother should look into to ascertain what would be the most practical way to allow the Children more quality time with the Father while not overburdening their rest time. However, I will not be making orders to prescribe a certain schedule. These are parenting matters best left to the parents to work together and resolve.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In the circumstances, I will not be ordering any change to the Children’s current <em>de facto</em> care arrangements, and have provided for a more comprehensive interim access arrangement for the Father to see the Children while the divorce proceedings are underway.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     To support the parties’ healing and to assist them to navigate their journey to co-parent the Children, I encourage them to continue to see their psychologist, Ms [S], to work on their mutual co-parenting skills and support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     After considering the parties’ costs submissions, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions dd 27.09.24 (“DS”) at [26]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dd 27.09.24 (“PS”) at [15] and [18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>PS at [20]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>DA2 at [36]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>PA1 at 9b</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>TJ Model at [9(a)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>TJ Model at [13]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>DS at [16]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>See <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/49688-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 135</a>;

The hearing was adjourned to 6 May 2024 at parties’ request to file a limited reply affidavit each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     At the substantive hearing, counsel took pains to take the court through voluminous affidavits and written submissions, with Ms Mirchandani and Mr Chugani taking turns to make lengthy oral submissions for the Mother. After I called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) and reserved my decision on 17 July 2024, I received several letters from counsel that contained new evidence and arguments. As this was done without the leave of the court, I placed no weight on the contents of the letters in reaching my decision. It is important for counsel to bear in mind the observations of the courts in <em>VYP v VYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26994-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 40</a> (at [36]) and <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a> (at [9]) on the proper conduct of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     That said, I noted from M/s Mirchandani &amp; Partners’ letter dated 4 December 2024 that the Mother’s application for a Long-Term Visit Pass (“LTVP”) had been rejected by the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”). As this was a development that could materially affect the care arrangement for the children, I directed the CER dated 2 December 2024 to be updated so that the evidence could be properly received and considered. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a> (at [36]) and reiterated in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (at [73]), welfare reports are admissible even if they may contain a certain amount of hearsay. Having received the updated CER on 30 December 2024, I rendered my decision on 24 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Although parties had made submissions on care and control before relocation, I was of the view that the primary issue that had to be decided first was relocation. In my brief grounds, I referred parties to <em>XBF v XBE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32437-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 42</a> where Choo Han Teck J noted (at [6]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This case is not as straightforward as it appears. The finding that the Respondent was the primary caregiver is challenged, not without grounds, by the Appellant. The DJ, however, conflated the idea that a relocation order follows care and control because it is in the best interests of the children to be with the primary caregiver. In many cases, that might be correct, but this is not such a case. The primary issue in this case is the relocation of the children, not which parent should be granted care and control. The two issues must be examined together. It cannot be assumed, as the court below did, that relocation follows the issue of care and control. The court should consider whether it is in the best interests for the children to be relocated to Indonesia, and the question of care and control can be determined as part of that inquiry. The best interests of the children may overlap with the best interests of the mother, but they are not the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Likewise, in <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> which concerned cross-appeals involving the care and control and relocation of the parties’ 3-year old child, Debbie Ong J (as she then was) noted (at [4]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I begin with the appeal of the Father in which he sought sole care and control of [G] and for leave to have [G] relocate to India with him. If the appeal against the DJ’s decision refusing relocation is allowed, then the other decisions on shared care and holding of the child’s legal documents will be affected and must be dealt with in that context.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Taking guidance from these cases, I decided that it would be more appropriate to determine the issue of relocation first. I gave careful consideration to the affidavits, submissions and the CER but was unable to find in favour of the Mother. While her wish to relocate to Brisbane was understandable and reasonable, it was incompatible with the interests of the children. Accordingly, I disallowed the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I was mindful that the Mother would likely be very disappointed by my decision. Relocation cases are never easy to decide as they involve a binary decision. Whichever way the court decides, the decision is bound to cause considerable pain and anguish to one of the parties: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (“<em>BNS v BNT</em>”) (at [2]). As noted in <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16951-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 1</a> (“<em>TAA v TAB</em>”) (at [18]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Raising children requires heavy commitment. The law expects no less from parents in post-divorce circumstances. This is not to say that the law does not recognise the difficulties and pain parents may have to bear, but children do grow up and such sacrifice is not demanded endlessly of a parent. Sacrifices may have to be made temporarily in the years when the children require them. The law chooses to place the welfare of the child above all else.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     My decision was not intended to deny the Mother’s wish to return to Brisbane. However, this was an application to relocate the children and a decision on relocation is based ultimately on the welfare of the children. On the facts before me, I did not find that it was in their best interests for the children to relocate at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my brief grounds, I stressed that a refusal to allow relocation at the time of application did not necessarily mean that a future relocation could never be possible: see <em>TAA v TAB</em> (at [20]). When circumstances have changed such that it is clear that relocation is in the best interests of the children, the Mother can always renew her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The parties agreed to have joint custody of the children but disputed care and control. While I was of the view that it would have been in their welfare for the children to continue to spend equal time with each parent should both parents remain living in Singapore, I noted that the Mother’s application for a LTVP had been rejected by the ICA.

There is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation where the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is reasonable. Rather, the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is only relevant to the extent that there would be a transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child, since it is the child’s welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (<em>BNS v BNT</em> at [20]; see also <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<em>TAA v TAB</em>”) at [17]). There is no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy amongst the various factors to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare. Where the factors stand in relation to one another depends, finally, on a consideration of all the facts of the case (<em>BNS v BNT</em> at [22]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As noted in the more recent decision of the Family Division in <em>WRU v WRT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31510-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 23</a> (“<em>WRU v WRT</em>”) (at [15]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… factors that the court may have regard to apart from the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver and the child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent include “the child’s age, the child’s attachment to each parent and other significant persons in the child’s life, the child’s wellbeing in her present country of residence, as well as the child’s developmental needs at that particular stage of life, including her cognitive, emotional, academic and physical needs” (<em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (“<em>UXH v UXI</em>”) at [28]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Additionally, the court should also consider the wishes of the children. As noted by Mavis Chionh J in <em>WRU v WRT</em>, “research supports the view it is more often than not beneficial for the parties and the children for the children to be given a voice on arrangements that are made for them”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_109\" id=\"Ftn_109_1\"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> and “greater focus ought to be placed on the child’s wishes and feelings in determining the welfare of the child”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_110\" id=\"Ftn_110_1\"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>. The learned judge also noted that “the question of how much weight is to be attached to the wishes of the child is a matter that falls within the judge’s discretion. Relevant factors that the judge should consider include the age and maturity of the children and the risk that the children may have been coached and pressurised by a parent to express certain views”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_111\" id=\"Ftn_111_1\"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable wishes of primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Joint intention of parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     There was ample evidence to support the Mother’s claim that the parties’ relocation, first to KL, and subsequently to Singapore, was temporary. The evidence showed that there was a joint intention for the family to return to Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     A clear example was an email dated 26 June 2021 from the Father to the maternal grandfather where the Father said so himself that “[w]e did originally plan to go to KL for three years” and that “[l]ong term, we will be living in Australia. I have committed to that.” In the same email, the Father also said that he “need a few more years to save” and the move to Singapore “was a short term solution to the long term aim of being in Australia”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_112\" id=\"Ftn_112_1\"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Another example was a message dated 13 July 2021, prior to the parties’ relocation to Singapore, where the Father assured the Mother that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_113\" id=\"Ftn_113_1\"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 11:03:04 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If at the end of 3 years it’s still no good for you, we go back to Australia in our separate ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     There was also clear evidence that the Mother was reluctant to move to Singapore. This was evident, for example, in the following text messages to the Father dated 11 July 2021 and 13 July 2021:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_114\" id=\"Ftn_114_1\"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 9:05:25 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">So what happens at the end of 3 years? I have zero money, you have what a little? And then we have to come back and try start again in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 11:27:42 am].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This moving to Singapore is taking me further and further away from being able to get a job, restart life and get the kids settled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 7:58:12 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Before I leave for Singapore I want either cash or bulimba transferred into my name. I’m taking a massive risk here that you are not going to destroy me when I get to Singapore. I can legally keep the kids here now, so if I give you the benefit of the doubt I expect you not to do it to me, country or money wise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 7:58:57 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I will be out of the workforce for 10 years, I will be literally starting my career again, for the benefit of yours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The evidence also showed that the Mother was emphatic that she would only be in Singapore for no more than 3 years. For example, in a text message dated 11 July 2021, she told the Father as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_115\" id=\"Ftn_115_1\"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 11.28:57 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I’m in Singapore for 3 years, no more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In light of the contemporaneous evidence, I was unable to accept the Father’s claim that the Mother wanted to move because she was bored of living in Singapore. In my view, this was not a fair characterisation of the Mother’s reason to relocate. Given the clear evidence on the joint intention of the parties, I found the Mother’s wish to return to her home country to be reasonable and consistent with the parties’ intention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Breakdown in relationship</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was not disputed that by the time the parties relocated to Singapore, their relationship had broken down. The parties lived separately and their relationship continued to deteriorate, with the Father commencing parenting and financial proceedings in Australia followed by the Mother commencing divorce proceedings also in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As observed in <em>UYK v UYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24728-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 9</a> (“<em>UYK v UYJ</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    In the recent decisions where leave to relocate <em>was granted</em>, many of the cases involved a parent returning to his or her home country after the breakdown of the parents’ relationship. On either ground, the Mother’s wish to return to Australia was eminently reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    In <em>UXH</em>, the Court noted that the parties appeared to accept that the case did not involve a spouse who has no significant connection to the forum country after the divorce, feels or is isolated, and wishes to return to his or her home country (usually the country in which he or she grew up and where the extended family remains). Some lawyers have referred to this factual matrix as a case of a “trailing spouse”. In such cases, depending on the precise facts, appropriate weight may be accorded to the possibility that denying the parent’s wish to relocate may so deeply affect such a parent’s well-being that this in turn has negative effects on the child (<em>UXH</em> at [16] and <em>BNS</em> ([25] <em>supra</em>) at [20]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In my view, the factual matrix in the present case was not dissimilar to the case of a “trailing spouse” described above. As the parties’ marriage had broken down irretrievably, the Mother’s wish to return to her home country was eminently reasonable, bearing in mind that she had been out of the workforce for a substantial period of time and had to restart her life and career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mother’s visa status</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father said that when his OnePass was issued in December 2023, the Mother refused to collect her Dependent’s Pass, which resulted in the uncertainty over the Mother’s visa status.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_116\" id=\"Ftn_116_1\"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> The Father submitted that the Mother’s refusal to cooperate with the Father was simply to gain an advantage in these proceedings – so that she could submit that her visa was uncertain and that she must be allowed to relocate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I did not find any merit in the Father’s allegation. Notably, the OnePass application was made on 3 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span>, well after the Mother’s relocation application was filed. The grounds of the Mother’s relocation would have crystallised at the point of filing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Moreover, it was difficult to see what tactical advantage would be served by the Mother jeopardising her own visa status. It must be remembered that this was an application for the relocation of the children, and not that of the Mother. The Mother did not require the permission of the court to relocate. The fact that the Mother’s visa status was uncertain did not mean that the relocation of the children would automatically be allowed. The overriding consideration in all relocation cases is the welfare of the child. This was reiterated in <em>BNS v BNT</em> at [19]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… there is <em>only one fundamental</em> – indeed, <em>critical</em> – legal principle upon which everything else (including the ultimate decision of the case itself) depends. And it is this – in considering relocation applications, <em>the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Although much ink was spilled by parties over the Mother’s visa status, it turned out that this consideration did not have a material bearing on the determination of the reasonableness of the Mother’s wish at the end of day. This was because there were sufficient grounds, independent of her visa status, to show that her wish to relocate was not unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No presumption in favour of allowing relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Although the Mother’s wish to relocate was reasonable, I was mindful that there is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation even in such a case. As noted in <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29111-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 28</a> (at [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may still disallow the application even if the relocating parent’s application is not unreasonable and done in bad faith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Hence, a finding of reasonableness was not the end of the inquiry. I had to consider if the Mother’s wish was incompatible with the interests of the children. This is also clear from <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a>, which held (at [11]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… While the wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, the court must determine if those wishes are incompatible with the interests of the child; where they may not be compatible, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own (<em>TAA</em> at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Relevance of shared care arrangement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Additionally, the following observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS v BNT</em> (at [20]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is not relevant <em>per se</em>. It is relevant <em>only to the extent</em> that it is found that there will be a transference of his or her insecurity and negative feelings onto <em>the child</em>. It is, after all, <em>the child’s</em> welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (or either of the parents for that matter).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As noted in <em>WNO v WNP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29869-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 19</a> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where there are two primary caregivers such as the present case, the transference of the insecurity and negative feelings onto the child by the parent who is disappointed that his or her relocation application is not granted is mitigated by the presence of the other caregiving parent. It follows that in such a situation, the wishes of the relocating parent would carry less weight compared to cases where the relocating parent is the sole caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In the present case, the shared care and control arrangement was relevant in assessing the weight to be accorded to the Mother’s wish. To the extent that the transference of the insecurity and negative feelings onto the children by the Mother was mitigated by the presence of the Father, the Mother’s wish to relocate would correspondingly carry lesser weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother’s claim that the shared care arrangement was forced on her appeared to be premised on a belief that her right to the children was superior to that of the Father. She also accused the Father of having “robbed her” of her fulltime care of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> However, such a belief is contrary to the expectations of the law. As noted in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, <b>the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother</b> in respect of such custody, administration or application <b>nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It is abundantly clear from the above provision that neither parent had a greater right to the children. Indeed, the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests: see <em>CX v CY</em> [2005] SLR (R) 690 (at [28]). The parental responsibility to care for a child is coequal (see <em>VWJ v VWI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29354-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 7</a> at [6]) and extends to supporting the child’s relationship with both parents (see <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> at [50]). As noted in <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0187.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 187</a> (at [21]), citing <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR (R) 233, “a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life”. Hence, a parent’s desire to play an active role in the child’s upbringing is to be strongly encouraged and commended. It ought not to be frown upon, as did the Mother in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother seemed averse to the Father playing a coequal role in the care of the children and had even sought to reduce the Father’s parenting time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> While it is common for a relocating parent to ask for sole care and control of the children for practical reasons, the Mother had insisted on sole care and control <em>even if</em> her relocation application was not allowed. I found this troubling, as it revealed a lack of insight on the importance of co-parenting to the well-being of the children. This lack of insight, coupled with her inability to move past personal grudges against the Father and belief that she was the superior parent, suggested that her co-parenting ability might be limited if granted sole care and control in the event of relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In contrast, the Father had consistently recognised the importance of the children maintaining a close relationship with the Mother. He did not seek to reduce the Mother’s parenting time nor did he ask to have sole care and control of the children. In <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a>, Debbie Ong J observed (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parental responsibility is a legal duty to be discharged by both parents. A strong parent is one who can support the child in having a close relationship with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In this regard, the Father was clearly the stronger parent as he was more attuned to the needs of the children in having a close relationship with both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Notwithstanding the claim by the Mother that the shared care arrangement was forced on her and neither in the best interests nor welfare of the children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_121\" id=\"Ftn_121_1\"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> the children did benefit from the shared care arrangement. As noted in <em>WRU v WRT</em> (at [36]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court is predominantly tasked with assessing the merits of the relocation application on the facts as they <em>presently are</em>, as opposed to the state of the relationship in the past (see <em>ULA v UKZ</em> at [50]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the Mother had sought to rake up the past and paint a dismal picture of the Father, it must be remembered that the paramount consideration should be the welfare of the children, and not the past conduct of a parent: see <em>UBQ v UBR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29508-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 10</a> (at [49]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Children’s interests</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Children’s views may be presented in child welfare reports, including specific issues reports, which are prepared by professionals: see <em>WRU v WRT</em> (at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     From the CER, I was very heartened to note that the children shared a close relationship with both parents despite the increasing tensions between the adults due to the relocation. I noted further that both children were cognisant that the Mother had been wanting to return to live in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The younger child enjoyed his holidays in Brisbane with the maternal family and shared extensively about their holiday farmhouse and biking adventures. However, he was concerned about leaving the Father behind, if he were to relocate to Australia with the Mother. He had no opinion whether to remain in Singapore or to relocate and would like to live in a country where he could see both parents frequently and equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The older child expressed worries about living in Australia during winter and being away from his friends. He shared that he had lived in Malaysia and Singapore most of his life and enjoyed living in the city and in the tropics. He hoped to continue living in either Singapore or Malaysia and hoped to continue with the current living arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Our courts have consistently recognised that siblings should not be separated: e.g. see <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> [1991] 1 SLR (R) 680 (at [22(d)]). In <em>WIQ v WIP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29516-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 16</a>, Choo Han Teck J explained the rationale (at [4]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is not usual for split care and control to be ordered. Keeping siblings together should be the norm for the obvious reason that the anxieties arising from their parental separation should not be increased by a further separation of a sibling. Nonetheless, this is just one of many considerations, and the weight to be given to it varies from case to case, each on its own facts: <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> <em>(&quot;ABW&quot;)</em> at [23] and [24]; <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Given the clear wishes of the older child to continue living in Singapore or Malaysia, the neutrality expressed by the younger child and the need to avoid separating the siblings, I found this factor (i.e. children’s wishes) to lean against relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Loss of children’s relationship with the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The loss of relationship a child may experience with the left-behind parent is another important factor in a relocation application. As noted in <em>TAA v TAB</em> (at [19]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A relocation of children to another jurisdiction is a serious matter. It would mean a fundamental change in whom the children would see as their close family and the children would lose the experience of hands-on parenting from both their mother and their father (see <em>K v K</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 793). <b>The court must give sufficient weight to the loss of the children’s relationship with the left-behind parent</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Having regard to the shared care arrangement, the children’s wishes and the close relationship the children shared with the Father, I found that the welfare of the children would be negatively impacted if relocation was allowed. Hence, while I was mindful that the loss of relationship in itself was not the dominant or determinant consideration (see <em>UYK v UYJ</em> (at [26])), it was nonetheless a significant factor in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s caregiving ability</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I noted from the CER that the Father appeared to be a highly involved parent who had demonstrated good knowledge of the children’s needs. The independent observations in the CER corroborated the evidence of the Father and third-party witnesses on his involvement in the lives of the children and his caregiving ability. The Father’s capacity to care for the children was also evident from the close relationship that the children shared with him. As admitted by the Mother herself, the children loved the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_122\" id=\"Ftn_122_1\"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Although the Mother had expressed concerns about the children’s care while they were with the Father, she had not shown how the proposed care arrangement in Brisbane would be any better.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s immigration status</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s immigration status in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Mother alleged that the Father’s OnePass application was for tactical reasons. She pointed out that the Father’s Employment Pass, the Mother’s Dependent Pass and the Children’s Dependent Passes were all valid up to 5 August 2026. There was hence no reason for the Father to have applied for the OnePass, 4 years before the expiry of his Employment Pass, save to facilitate his agenda in these proceedings. The OnePass allowed the Father to stay in Singapore until November 2028.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_123\" id=\"Ftn_123_1\"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Mother’s allegation raised a question of fact about the Father’s motive in applying for the OnePass. However, parties did not address how the Father’s immigration status was relevant to the inquiry. It should be noted that even a relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is not relevant <em>per se</em>. It is relevant only to the extent that it is found that there will be a transference of his or her insecurity and negative feelings onto the child: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (at [20]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     While the relevance of the Mother’s immigration status could be readily appreciated within the context of ascertaining the reasonableness of her wish to relocate, the relevance of the Father’s immigration status was less apparent. It cannot be assumed that any point of contention raised by a disputing party is necessarily relevant to the inquiry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Leaving aside the question of relevance, I found no merit in the Mother’s allegation in any event. The evidence showed that the Father’s employer was keen for him to obtain a OnePass even before the Mother’s relocation application was filed. However, the Father could only apply for OnePass in mid-2023 as he was required to establish a sufficient history of earnings in order to be eligible for OnePass.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_124\" id=\"Ftn_124_1\"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> Hence, it could not be the case that the Father had applied for OnePass to thwart the Mother’s relocation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s immigration status in Australia</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Mother also submitted that the Father, as a PR of Australia, would have the ability to stay in Australia, work, own properties and have banking accounts in his own name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_125\" id=\"Ftn_125_1\"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> The Father however chose not to move to or practise in Brisbane.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_126\" id=\"Ftn_126_1\"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father explained that the travel facility associated with his Australian PR had lapsed. There was no point in holding the Australian PR without an ability to enter and leave Australia. It was meaningless, and the Mother was conveniently describing a technicality without addressing the substance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_127\" id=\"Ftn_127_1\"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> To obtain a new visa, he would need to prove that he had “substantial ties” to Australia that were “of benefit” to Australia. The application would require time,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_128\" id=\"Ftn_128_1\"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> the conditions were not easily met<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_129\" id=\"Ftn_129_1\"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> and there was no certainty as to the likely outcome.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_130\" id=\"Ftn_130_1\"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Furthermore, the paternal grandmother had relocated from the UK to Singapore on 10 December 2021 to be reunited with the Father and the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_131\" id=\"Ftn_131_1\"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> The children’s bond with the grandmother was strong.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_132\" id=\"Ftn_132_1\"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> The grandmother would similarly encounter, and probably even more challenging issues, with respect to obtaining an Australian visa.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_133\" id=\"Ftn_133_1\"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The Father also explained that he would not be an attractive hire in Australia, especially in the context of a hastily arranged move. The absolute best-case outcome would be an Associate role, which would come with a huge reduction in remuneration and a period of operating as a trainee.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_134\" id=\"Ftn_134_1\"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> This was not an attractive option, and would be decidedly negative to the family. The children would not benefit from a father who was suddenly earning far less, but working infinitely more hours with far less professional independence and flexibility.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_135\" id=\"Ftn_135_1\"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In my view, it was not reasonable for the Mother to trivialise the challenges highlighted by the Father. These were real obstacles with potentially adverse consequences for the family and the children. Moreover, the marriage had broken down. The Father, unlike the Mother, was not an Australian citizen. It would not be reasonable to expect the Father to relocate to Australia, just as it would be unreasonable to expect the Mother to stay put in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Hence, even if the Father’s immigration status was relevant to the inquiry, it was not a factor in favour of relocation. At best, it was a neutral factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In conclusion, while I was satisfied that the Mother’s wish to relocate to Australia was not unreasonable or founded in bad faith, I found her wish to be incompatible with the interests of the children. Other than the fact that the children were Australian citizens, the Mother had not shown how the relocation to Australia would benefit the children compared to the <em>status quo</em>. Indeed, her relocation plan appeared to serve her interests rather than those of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     While her wish to restart her career and life was understandable, this would have to be balanced against other relevant factors as the paramount consideration was the welfare of the children. The children shared a close relationship with the Father and the older child, in particular, had expressed a clear wish to continue living in Singapore or Malaysia. The younger child was neutral but would like to be able to see both parents frequently and equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The Mother’s application for a LTVP had been rejected by the ICA while there were real challenges for the Father to relocate to Australia. The stark reality facing this family was that the parents would have to live in separate jurisdictions, at least in the foreseeable future. A shared care and control arrangement was no longer feasible. Either way, there would be a loss of relationship with the other parent which would have to be mitigated by a generous access plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     However, the Mother’s ability to co-parent if granted sole care and control in the event of relocation was a cause for concern. She was unable to recognise the Father’s contributions to the children’s upbringing and could only see all sorts of reasons to find fault with his parenting. Her lack of insight on the importance of co-parenting and belief that she had superior right made me doubt whether she would be able to support the father-sons bond, notwithstanding her assurance to the court that she would do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_136\" id=\"Ftn_136_1\"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> She had also sought to reduce the Father’s parenting time by seeking a sole care and control order even if relocation was not granted, which only deepened my doubt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In contrast, the Father had consistently demonstrated a willingness to support the children in having a close relationship with the Mother. In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, Judith Prakash J observed (at [45]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it would be in the children’s interests for them to be with the parent who was willing to be reasonable about access and could share them with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     As the Father was more likely to share the children with the Mother and facilitate generous access, the welfare of the children would be better served by allowing the children to be with the Father. This arrangement would also align with the children’s wishes and avoid any unnecessary disruption to their lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Balancing all factors, I concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the children to relocate to Brisbane at this point in time. Accordingly, the Mother’s relocation application was disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     As it was important for the family to heal and move on, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit in support of FC/OSG 60/2023 filed on 11 May

class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       MSS 1444 of 2024 (“MSS 1444”) was the Mother’s application to enforce the arrears in respect of an Order of Court <em>vide</em> MO xxx/2016. Pursuant to that order, the Father was ordered to pay a monthly sum of $350 for the maintenance of one child. Both parties were self-represented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 17 December 2024 and reserved judgment. On 14 January 2025, I handed down my decision and made the relevant orders. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother confirmed, during the hearing, that she was seeking to enforce arrears from January 2017 all the way up to August 2024. The total amount which the Mother sought to enforce thus came up to $32,200.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Given the time period in respect of which the Mother was seeking to recover arrears of maintenance, the first issue I had to deal with was whether the time bar set out in s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) was applicable. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Recovery of arrears of maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is clear that, s 121(3) of the WC applies to the present case. This is because s 74 of the WC states (see also <em>VLW v VLX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25137-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 84</a> at [19(a) and [20]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Application of section 121</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">74.    Section 121 applies, with the necessary modifications, to any order for the payment of maintenance under this Part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Given this, the Mother therefore had to show that there were such special circumstances which warranted her being able to recover arrears in respect of maintenance beyond the three years as provided for under s 121(3) of the WC: <em>Koay Guat Kooi (m w) v Eddie Yeo (formerly known as Yap Ah Huat alias Yeo Ah Nee)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6511-M.xml')\">[1997] SGHC 197</a> (“<em>Koay Guat Kooi</em>”) at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The time bar in s 121(3) of the WC ensures that applicants seeking to enforce a maintenance order do so in a timely fashion – doing so would reflect a true need on their part. This comports with the rationale for the court’s power to order maintenance: that is to “provide for the urgent and pressing financial needs of the receiving party, and to ensure that such needs are not deferred due to a lack of assurance that sums expended would eventually be compensated”: <em>VLW v VLX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25137-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 84</a> at [19(d)]. This time bar also ensures that the paying party is not taken by surprise where the recipient of maintenance makes no complaint about the non-payment of maintenance for several years, but one day, decides to haul the paying party to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       That said, the time bar in s 121(3) is not cast in absolute terms. The “special circumstances” exception accommodates situations where a “wife may have genuine reasons for not applying for recovery of arrears before” the expiry of the three-year period (see the Singapore Parliamentary Reports on the Third Reading of the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill (as reported from the Select Committee) dated 27 August 1996 at col 524).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There are, generally speaking, two broad situations where the court may find that there are special circumstances justifying the waiver of the three-year time bar: see <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The first are situations where the circumstances are “sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would do great injustice to the [applicant]”. Justice Choo Han Teck (“Choo J”) had made this observation in <em>Koay Guat Kooi</em>. That case concerned an appeal against the decision of a District Judge in respect of orders made relating to the division of the matrimonial flat and the award of past and current maintenance. The District Judge had declined to order arrears of maintenance for more than 3 years because of s 115(3) of the Women’s Charter which stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot;No amount owing as maintenance shall be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the wife in that case had contended that while this was the provision in force at the time of the hearing, the law had changed – the words “unless the court under special circumstances allows” were added to what was then s 115(3) of the Women’s Charter. According to counsel, there were special circumstances because parties had lived apart for 14 years, and in that time, the wife did not know where the husband was, and could therefore not ask for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This argument found little weight with Choo J who noted that there was no proof that efforts were “made by the wife to contact the husband but to no avail” and that given this, it could also be equally said that she did not wish to claim maintenance then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The second sort of situation where special circumstances are shown involve cases where the payor of maintenance has, through their actions, frustrated attempts to enforce the maintenance order, or taken steps to avoid paying the full sums owed in maintenance: <em>UAE</em> at [21(b)] and [21(c)]. There are two cases which illustrate this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>Meenatchi d/o Kuppusamy v Subbiah Pillai</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0202.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 202</a>, the wife had sought to enforce arrears of $103,500 for the period July 2006 to 21 March 2012. The court found that there were “special circumstances” which justified the recovery of arrears beyond the 3-year time bar. The wife in that case had first commenced enforcement proceedings against the husband in 2008 – however, her application fell through as the husband’s registered address could not be ascertained for service to be effected. The reason for this was apparent from the husband’s passport which showed that he had been travelling frequently to Malaysia, India and Bangladesh, and that he had been issued visas which allowed him to remain in India and Bangladesh for a few months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Second, in <em>Lee Meng Leng v Tan Huat Soon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16317-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 224</a> (“<em>Lee Meng Leng</em>”), the court had found that the respondent husband was in the habit of “unilaterally deduct[ing] monies from court-ordered maintenance” that was due to the complainant without first obtaining either the complainant’s agreement or a valid court order. The court thus considered it appropriate to allow enforcement of arrears beyond the 3-year time bar, noting that such “unilateral deductions from court-ordered maintenance by respondents c[ould] not be condoned by the courts”: <em>Lee Meng Leng</em> at [44] – [47].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Returning to the present case, I do not find that the Mother has shown that there are special circumstances which warrant allowing her to enforce the arrears beyond the three year period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     During the trial, the Mother gave two reasons as to why she was unable to bring an application to enforce the arrears owed earlier. The first was that she was the main caregiver for her children, and was therefore unable to find the time to come to court to file an application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second reason was that her ex-husband did not allow her to come to court to file an application. The Mother explained that her ex-husband was jealous of the Father. In that vein, it appears that the Mother was afraid of what might happen to her if she came to court to file an application to enforce the arrears<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> – she stated that her ex-husband was a “wife-beater”. The Mother also explained that she could not contact the Father as her ex-husband had deleted all the contacts in her phone and made her replace her SIM card.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     That being said, the Mother appears to have escaped the unfortunate situation with her ex-husband following their divorce in 2020. It would have been possible for her to file an enforcement application without having to live in fear of what her ex-husband might say or do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     During the hearing, I had asked the Mother to explain why she had waited for four years after her divorce with her ex-husband before bringing the present enforcement application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Mother explained that it was only in 2024 that she discovered that she was able to make an online application to enforce the arrears. Up to that point, her hands were full from looking after her children (which included one special needs child) on her own, dealing with her own health issues, and coping with various issues arising from her divorce (which included looking for a place to stay).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I could not accept this explanation. There was nothing, apart from what the Mother had said in her testimony, which had been put in evidence before me to demonstrate that the circumstances she faced in the years following her divorce rendered her unable to file an application. It would have been a different situation had the Mother, in the years following her divorce in 2020, filed an application for enforcement but subsequently abandoned that application. This was not the case. The only other enforcement application which the Mother had brought against the Father was in 2017, <em>vide</em> MSS xxxx/2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore find that the Mother is only entitled to enforce the maintenance arrears for a period of three years prior to the filing of her application in MSS 1444 (<em>ie</em>, 26 June 2021 to 26 June 2024). The arrears for this period comes up to a total of $12,600. In addition to this, I also take into account the arrears for the period from July to August 2024. I do so because it is undisputed between both parties that the Father had only started making payment in September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In summary, the total arrears that the Mother can enforce against the Father comes up to $13,300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The second issue which I turn now to address is whether the Father had shown cause. It is hornbook law that a respondent to enforcement proceedings is to be given a chance to “show cause” – in other words, the respondent is afforded an opportunity to provide satisfactory reasons as to why an enforcement order should not be made: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> (“<em>VUJ</em>”) at [20] citing <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a>; <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a> at [9] . In making an order for enforcement, the court must bear in mind whether the making of an enforcement order would “lead to injustice” or whether it would be “inequitable to do so given the circumstances and facts of a given case”: <em>VUJ</em> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Cases where the court has found it inequitable to enforce the maintenance order against a respondent include those where there was a mutual agreement between the parties that the amount of maintenance payable should be reduced. It also includes cases where the respondent had either gone above and beyond what was required under the maintenance order, or where the complainant had used the respondent’s money to pay for expenses falling within the scope of the maintenance order, or where the respondent had been diligently paying maintenance but had run into genuine financial difficulties and was therefore unable to keep up with the payments: <em>VUJ</em> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I do not find that the Father had shown cause. For one, there could not have been any sort of mutual agreement between the parties that the Mother was happy to forgo the sums owed under the maintenance order. Neither party disputed that they were, in the intervening years between 2017 up till September 2024 (which was when the Mother had texted the Father to demand payment)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, in contact with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to why the Father did not keep up with the maintenance payments, he explained to me that after the Mother’s previous application in 2017 had been struck off, he had simply assumed that the case was closed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father did not check with anyone as to whether he had to continue paying maintenance, and simply assumed that he could stop paying the $350 owed every month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I cannot accept that the Father had shown cause on the basis that he did not know he had to continue to comply with the order. If he was uncertain of the consequences of the Mother’s application being struck out, the onus was on him to check.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, I would add that I do not find that the Father had gone above and beyond the maintenance order. This issue arises because it emerged from the testimony of both parties, that the Father had made payment of $500 per month for the period September to December 2024. It would thus appear that the Father had paid more than the stipulated $350 monthly sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father, however, had explained that he had paid an extra $150 because that sum of money was meant for a second child which he had with the Mother. To contribute this sum of $500, the Father had resorted to doing more overtime shifts at work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     While the Father’s efforts to provide for both his children are indeed commendable, this is not something I can give weight to in deciding whether the Father had shown cause. The facts of the present case are quite different from that in <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> (at [22] – [27]) where the court had found that the respondent husband had gone above and beyond the maintenance order. In that case, the husband had been paying the wife monthly maintenance of $6,500 although the court order only provided for a monthly maintenance sum of $5,725. In addition to that, the husband had also met the entirety of his obligations to pay for the other items under the court order as well as items which did not come within the ambit of the order. Given this, the court found that the husband had always, when he was financially able, done his part and gone beyond his legal obligations to support the wife. Because of this, it would have been inequitable to penalise the husband for falling behind on maintenance payments now that he found himself in dire financial straits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, it is undisputed that the Father had not complied with the order of maintenance. The Father had admitted to this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> And while the Father’s additional payment might have had the effect of reducing the Mother’s financial burden – it must be emphasised that a parent has the obligation to provide for their children: s 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961. The Father is simply doing what is expected of him as a parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I therefore find that the Father has not shown cause and order that the arrears, which come up to $13,300, be enforced against him. The Father shall pay off these arrears in monthly instalments of $100 with effect from 1 February 2025. This payment shall be made to the Mother’s designated bank account on the last day of each month.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9, ln 14 – 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9 ln 26 – 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13, ln 27 – 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13, ln 20 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 4 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 14 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>This application was struck out as the Mother did not turn up for the hearing.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9, ln 2 – 6 and p 18 ln 1 – 7 and ln 26 - 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Transcript at p 30, ln 1 – 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, ln 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, ln 25 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>The appeal against the decision of the District Judge in DCA 16/2014 was deemed withdrawn on 1 July 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Transcript p 19 at ln 26 – 30.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order","Family Law – Domestic Exclusion Order"],"date":"2025-04-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 265 and 280 of 2024","title":"XKY v XKX and another matter","citation":"[2025] SGFC 37","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33099-SSP.xml","counsel":["The applicant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-04-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XKY v XKX and another matter</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XKY <em>v</em> XKX and another matter </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33099-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 37</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The parents had taken out applications for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for themselves and their youngest son in SS 265 and 280 of 2024. In addition to the PPO, a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) was also sought. The respondent is their eldest son [XKX].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over the course of three days. Upon conclusion of the trial, I reserved judgment, after parties had made their respective oral submissions. On 21 March 2025, I handed down my judgment, allowing the applications in both SS 265 and 280, and giving the following reasons for doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is well-established law that an applicant for a PPO must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities. First, that the respondent had either committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> or was likely to commit family violence. Second, that the PPO is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I found that XKX was indeed likely to commit family violence. It was apparent from the course of his testimony, that he bore a deep grudge towards his parents and younger brother. XKX recounted how his parents would favour his younger brother – for instance, he shared how his parents had purchased the latest gadgets for his younger brother, but neglected to do the same for him. He also recounted how he would have to shoulder the blame for the fights and scuffles that he would have with his younger brother. Whenever these fights took place, his mother would cane him, but do nothing to discipline his younger brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Naturally, XKX’s parents felt wronged by his accusation that they had especially doted on or favoured his younger brother over him. The both of them, especially XKX’s mother, sought to challenge XKX’s narrative on this point during the course of XKX’s cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In assessing the merits of both applications, it is not necessary for me to decide whether XKX’s parents had indeed doted on him, nor do I need to determine whether XKX had a valid basis for holding a grudge against the rest of his family. What was abundantly clear to me was that XKX did hold this deep-seated grudge which left him feeling isolated and all alone in the world as he had no member of his family to confide in, to the point where he only had ChatGPT to turn to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       More importantly, however, that grudge which XKX held did lead him to lash out violently against his family members. His father bore the brunt of XKX’s wrath as was evident from the various pictures showing the extent of his injuries. Indeed, XKX did not deny hitting his father, nor did XKX deny getting into several altercations with his parents as well as his younger brother. These altercations demonstrated XKX’s proclivity for violence – for instance, XKX admitted to biting his brother. He also recounted how he had gone into “a frenzy” when his father had, in one incident, grabbed him by the collar – he lashed out blindly and kicked his mother in the leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As to the necessity of ordering a PPO, the cases tell us that once it is established that the respondent is likely to commit family violence, it follows as a matter of logic that a PPO is necessary to protect the applicant: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Leaving aside any presumption, on the facts before me, I found it necessary to order a PPO for the protection of XKX’s parents as well as his younger brother. Determining the necessity of a PPO is, in essence, a risk assessment: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. The court must consider the likelihood of the respondent committing further acts of family violence on the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     A PPO is indeed necessary in the present case. XKX still bears a deep resentment towards his parents and younger brother, and he has, through his own account of the incidents in contention, demonstrated a propensity for violence. These are significant red flags pointing towards the necessity of a PPO. While XKX has already moved out to live on his own, and indicated that he wished to cut off any and all ties with his family, the mere physical separation in this case does not suffice to reduce the risk of family violence. Until XKX has learnt to let go of his hate, anger and animosity towards the rest of his family, it is, in my judgment, quite likely that there will continue to be a high risk of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In this connection, and for the same reasons that I have already set out, I also find it necessary to grant a DEO for the protection or personal safety of the applicant. This enforced physical separation is needed to ensure that there are no further acts of physical violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In summary, both applications in SS 265 and 280 are allowed in its entirety. In addition to the PPO and DEO, I am also ordering that all parties (XKX, as well as his parents and younger brother) go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On this final note, I conclude with a few words to XKX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     While I have made the relevant orders against you, I must emphasise that the purpose of this trial was to ascertain whether a PPO and a DEO should be granted for the protection of your family members. The orders that I have made are not meant to punish you. They are meant to ensure the protection of your parents and younger brother. That much is made clear by the relevant provisions in the Women’s Charter as well as the jurisprudence of the Family Courts (see <em>e.g</em>. <em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I must also remind you of the effect of these orders. You are not to commit family violence on your parents or your younger brother. This includes physically attacking, or verbally abusing them. The breach of these orders is an arrestable offence, for which penalties include a fine or imprisonment: see s 65(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In practical terms, this is effect of the DEO which I have ordered: home is now behind you – but a whole world lies ahead. I strongly urge you to use this as a fresh start. Where you go from here is entirely up to you, but nothing is impossible if you are willing to learn and to put in the hard work. Above all, you must work on laying to rest the grievances, resentment and hurt you have accrued over the years for you will not truly be at peace until you have done so.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[XKX] had, due to his age, a litigation representative (his aunt) at the hearing before me.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>References to the Women’s Charter 1961 in this judgment are references to the version in force before 2 January 2025.</p></div></content></root>"}]
