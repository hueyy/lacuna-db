The Complainant is 44 years old this year. The Respondent is 50 years old this year. The Complainant and the Respondent live separately. The Complainant lives with her son, though her parents and her other sisters sometimes live with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 26 June 2024, the Complainant applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Respondent. On 19 July 2024, the Respondent applied for a personal protection order against the Complainant. I heard both applications together and dismissed both. The Complainant has filed an appeal against my decision to dismiss her application. As the Respondent did not file any appeal against my decision to dismiss hers, this decision will focus on my reasons for dismissing the Complainant’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Complainant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In the Complainant’s complaint form (the “Complaint Form”), she claimed that the Respondent caused hurt to her, placed her in fear of hurt, and continually harassed her. The Complainant primarily relied on an incident on 24 June 2024 to support her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Complainant’s recount of the incident on 24 June 2024 is, in brief, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Complainant had just stepped out of her room after a shower and was surprised to see the Respondent sitting in the dining area of her home. The Respondent did not inform the Complainant that she would be there.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent then started threatening the Complainant. The Respondent brought up the fact of the Complainant’s recent divorce from her former husband, saying “<em>that is why your ex-spouse and you have to divorce because you are like this</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Respondent started taking a video of the Complainant using her phone. This agitated the Complainant, who asked the Respondent to stop. The Respondent refused to stop, saying “<em>I want to see how you’re so angry</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Respondent called the Complainant’s son, to ask him to look at the Complainant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Complainant saw her mother packing her belongings into her luggage and noticed that she had taken a teeth retainer belonging to one of her sister’s daughters. The Complainant told her mother to remove this from her luggage. When she did not comply, the Complainant removed this from the luggage herself using her right hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Respondent and her mother then tried to stop the Complainant. The Respondent tried to grab the teeth retainer and hurt the Complainant in the process. After the Respondent successfully took away the teeth retainer from the Complainant, the Complainant freed herself.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal requirements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The definition of ‘family violence’ is set out in Section 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). This includes the commission of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Section 64 of the Charter also defines ‘hurt’ as “<em>bodily pain, disease and infirmity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 65(1) of Charter 1961 provides that the court may grant a PPO if two requirements have been met. First, the court must be satisfied that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed. Second, the court must be satisfied that a protection order is necessary for the protection of that family member. The burden of proof is on the Complainant to prove that these two requirements have been met on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On the balance of the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that the Respondent had committed family violence on the Complainant, or that the Respondent was likely to commit family violence on the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent cause the Complainant hurt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Complainant claimed that the physical altercation caused her soreness on her right arm, scratches on her palm and wrist, and a bruise near her thumb. These injuries could constitute “hurt”, as defined in Section 64 of the Charter. The Complainant adduced five pictures showing a wound on her right palm and marks around her right hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She also adduced a memo with a referral letter, certifying that the Complainant had visited a clinic on 26 June 2024 for “<em>right shoulder strain and superficial abrasion over right wrist and palm</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The evidence provided by the Complainant may have shown that the Complainant did suffer some injuries, but it did not necessarily establish that it was the Respondent who caused her these injuries. It remained unclear from the evidence <em>who</em> caused the injuries and <em>how</em> they were caused:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no evidence advanced by the Complainant to show that the Respondent was responsible for the injuries, bearing in mind that the tussle over the teeth retainer (that the Complainant says led to the hurt) was a tussle that involved three persons. There was also a lack of detail and description, whether in her Complaint Form, her affidavit, or from her oral evidence, to explain just <em>how</em> the Respondent had caused her the injuries she claimed. Even the referral form issued by the clinic she visited on 26 June 2024 stated that the Complainant was “<em>uncomfortable to elaborate more other than she was pushed</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During cross-examination, when asked about the cause of the blister on her palm, the Complainant was initially reserved in levelling any accusation that it was the Respondent who directly caused her injuries. Instead, her response was more oblique and general, saying that it was caused by the “<em>commotion … by the physical interaction that was---came towards [her] while the Respondent is trying to take the teeth retainer from [her] palm</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Respondent in fact did not seem certain as to the cause of the blister, saying that she “<em>suspect[ed]</em>” that it was from a sharp nail.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While the Complainant complained of a pain on her upper arm and suggested that this was caused during her physical altercation with the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, she had, in her Complaint Form, also conceded that this was because she “<em>just had [her] covid booster on 7<sup>th</sup> June</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This cast doubt over whether the Respondent was responsible for the pain that the Complainant felt in her upper arm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Further, I note that there were some inconsistencies in the Complainant’s evidence, which in my view diminished the credibility and likelihood of the Complainant’s claims relating to her injuries:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her Complaint Form, the Complainant accused the Respondent of “<em>hurting [the Complainant’s] palm with scratches and bruise on [her] right hand</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, in C1, which contained the Complainant’s fleshed-out evidence, the Complainant did not mention being scratched by the Respondent at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In C1, the only acts of physical contact alleged were that the Respondent pushed the Complainant when trying to snatch the teeth retainer from her, and that the Respondent had restrained her (implied in the Complainant’s claim that she had to “<em>free [herself]</em>” from the Respondent). However, there was no suggestion on the Complaint Form that the Respondent pushed the Complainant or tried to restrain her. It is also noted that the nature of family violence complained of by the Complainant was not that of physical restraint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence before me, I therefore found that the Complainant was unable to prove that the Respondent had caused her the hurt she claimed to have suffered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent place the Complainant in fear of hurt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Complainant did not articulate in what way she had been placed in fear of hurt. While she suggests in C1 that she had to “<em>break free</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> from the Respondent, there was no indication that the Respondent had intended to hurt her, such that she should have been afraid of being hurt if she had not freed herself. This is especially so where on the face of the Complainant’s evidence, the Respondent appeared focused on taking the teeth retainer away from the Complainant, rather than on specifically inflicting or threatening to inflict any sort of hurt on the Complainant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Complainant also mentioned being ‘threatened’ by the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. However, there were no details as to what was said, or what were the threads made by the Respondent. There also did not appear to be any history of the Respondent threatening to hurt the Complainant, nor was there any suggestion that the Respondent was predisposed to inflict violence, such as to give the Complainant cause for such concern.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore did not find sufficient evidence to establish that the Respondent had placed the Complainant in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Respondent continually harass the Complainant?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Complainant claims to have been traumatised by the Respondent’s unannounced entry into her home. The Respondent had not given the Complainant any prior notice that she would be there, and the Complainant was surprised to see the Respondent in her home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I did not find the Respondent’s entry into the Complainant’s home in itself to have placed the Complainant in fear of hurt (given the absence of any threat of hurt), or to amount to continual harassment for the purposes of establishing family violence. Both the Respondent and her mother each had a key to the Complainant’s home, and there was also no evidence that the Complainant had asked the Respondent to return her house keys prior to the incident. This suggests that the Complainant did not consider them to be persons whom she was afraid of and whom she could not trust with access to her home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Furthermore, the Respondent did not enter the Complainant’s home by force, nor did she do so without reason. It was evident that she was there to accompany her mother, who was there to pack her belongings which were left in the Complainant’s home. In this context, it did not seem to me that the Respondent had appeared in the Complainant’s home with the intent of causing her anguish. In fact, it is unclear to me whether the Respondent would even have known that her presence in the house would have caused the Complainant anguish. I therefore did not find the Respondent’s entry into the Complainant’s home, as unwelcome as it may have been, to amount to continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Respondent had also allegedly made hurtful remarks to the Complainant about her relationship with her ex-husband, started taking a video of the Complainant, and asked the Complainant’s son to look at her while she was angry. Taken at face value, I accept that such acts could be provocative and aggravating. However, I did not find these claims to have been established on the evidence presented. In any case, the law requires that any harassment must be continual (see <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [43]); that is, the act must be repeated or repetitive (see <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [6(d)(ii)]). I did not consider any harassment that may have been caused to the Complainant to be <em>continual</em>, bearing in mind that there was no suggestion or proof of that the Respondent had previously provoked the Complaint in similar fashion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore did not find the Respondent to have committed family violence against the Complainant by way of continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Having found no family violence committed by the Respondent, I consequently declined to grant the PPO sought by the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, <em>even if</em> I were to find that the Respondent had inflicted family violence on the Complainant (which I did not in this case), I would not have found a protection order to be <em>necessary</em> for the protection of the Complainant. In my view, the tussle on 24 June 2024 was a one-off incident between the parties that started when the Complainant removed a teeth retainer from her mother’s luggage. It was her mother who first intervened to stop the Complainant, before the Respondent intervened. There does not appear to have been any other incident between them, whether before or after this incident, whether within the Complainant’s home, or anywhere else. It was also the Complainant’s position that the Respondent never entered her home before this incident, even though the Respondent held a key to her home, which suggests a low probability of the circumstances on 24 June 2024 repeating itself. I also noted that between the hearing on 27 November 2024 and 13 January 2025, the Respondent returned her copy of the Complainant’s home key to the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In any event, I also noted that it was the Complainant’s own evidence that her interaction with the Respondent was limited at best. The Complainant’s evidence was that the parties were not close to each other, and that if at all, they only communicate to arrange for the Respondent’s daughter to give tuition to the Complainant’s son, which the Respondent’s daughter had been doing since March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Complainant said that the parties would cross paths with each other during family gatherings such as Chinese New Year, however I find the incidence of any family violence during such group settings to be unlikely. I therefore found the risk of the Respondent committing family violence against the Complainant in future to be low or non-existent, and that a PPO would therefore have been unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As neither party made any request for costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 13 September 2024 (“C1”), para 13</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>C1, para 15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>C1, para 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>C1, para 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>C1, paras 19 - 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>C1, paras 20 - 22</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>C1, p 47 - 51</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>C1, p 53 - 56</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>C1, p 56</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 27 November 2024 (“NE1”), p 9 lines 5 - 6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE1, p 19 lines 23 - 24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE1, p 19 lines 20 – 21</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>C1, p 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>C1, p 16 - 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>C1, paras 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>See C1, paras 21 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>C1, para 15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>C1, para 10</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Stay of proceedings – Forum non conveniens"],"date":"2025-04-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 1289 of 2024, (Registrar's Appeal No 12 of 2025)","title":"XLN v XLM","citation":"[2025] SGFC 47","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33214-SSP.xml","counsel":["Complainant- in- person","Respondent- in- person."],"timestamp":"2025-05-09T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheela Kumari Devi","html":"<root><head><title>XLN v XLM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XLN <em>v</em> XLM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33214-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 47</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Wife also filed the present maintenance proceedings for wife and child maintenance (<b>“MSS 1289”</b>) and an application for a personal protection order for herself via SS 1057 of 2024 (<b>“SS 1057”</b>) against the Husband on 4 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       For context, the Husband applied to stay D 5293 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> citing that India was the better forum. The Husband also commenced divorce proceedings in India. The Husband’s stay application was allowed by the learned Deputy Presiding Judge Chia Wee Kiat on 30 December 2024 and no appeal was filed by the Wife against the same. The parties’ divorce proceedings are on-going in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both parties acted in person. At the hearing of MSS 1289 and SS 1057 on 17 December 2024, the Husband orally applied to stay both proceedings on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. I heard the applications on 24 February 2025 and dismissed both applications. The Husband has filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision in respect of MSS 1289. I shall now set out my brief reasons for dismissing the Husband’s application to stay MSS 1289.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed by the parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties filed the following affidavits in respect of the stay application for MSS 1289:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Husband’s affidavit filed on 20 December 2024 (<b>“R1”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s affidavit filed on 30 December 2024 (<b>“C1”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Wife’s affidavit filed on 12 February 2025 (<b>“C2”</b>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Husband’s affidavit filed on 16 February 2025 (<b>“R2”</b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband’s case was set out in R1 and R2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In summary, the Husband’s case was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     India is the more appropriate forum for hearing the maintenance proceedings and ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Singapore court has found that India is the better forum to decide on the issues related to the divorce including the ancillary matters such as maintenance. The outcome of the stay application in D 5293 is binding on the MSS court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife can apply for interim maintenance in India immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Allowing MSS 1289 to proceed would be inconsistent with the outcome of the stay application in D 5293 that Singapore is not the appropriate forum to deal with the ancillary matters. Further, if the Singapore Court grants interim maintenance, it will interfere with the Indian divorce proceedings and complicate the overall financial adjudication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There are ongoing divorce proceedings in India and an application for interim maintenance can be made immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parties have never intended to permanently settle in Singapore. As such, given their temporary status, it would be inappropriate for the Singapore Court to assume jurisdiction over long-term matters such as spousal maintenance, which should be decided in India, which is their home country.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_g\"></a>(g)     There is no urgency for interim maintenance as the Wife has financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s case was set out in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In summary, the Wife’s case was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     R1 only addresses why the divorce proceedings should not continue in Singapore and does not address why MSS 1289 should not proceed in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties and the Child have no plans to relocate to India. The Wife has been staying in Singapore since November 2019 and now holds an employment pass on the basis of her employment. The Child is also studying in Singapore. The Husband has been working in the same office in Singapore for the past 4.5 years and has not indicated anywhere in his affidavit of his immediate intention to resign his job and go to India to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife and the Child’s monthly expenses are being incurred and will continue to be incurred in Singapore. It is therefore better that the Singapore Courts assess how much they should both be entitled to for maintenance from the Husband. Further, if the Husband fails to pay maintenance, the Wife can go to the Singapore courts for aid and assistance in enforcement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife will suffer severe prejudice if a stay is granted as the Indian Courts do require quite a number of hearings to be attended to in person. The Wife will have to travel to India with the Child and engage Indian lawyers to assist her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The applicable test to determine if a proceeding commenced in Singapore ought to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (the <b><em>“Spiliada </em></b><b>test”</b>). As such, the issues that I was to decide on as per the <em>Spiliada</em> test were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there was another available forum which was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to determine the dispute as per stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there was another available forum which was <em>prima facie</em> more appropriate than Singapore, whether there were any special circumstances existing to warrant the exercise of the Court’s discretion to refuse a stay as per stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In relation to the first issue, my finding was that Singapore is the most appropriate forum to determine the issue of interim maintenance. As such there was no need for me to go on to make to a finding on the second issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I set out my reasons for my findings on the first issue below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue: Whether Singapore was the most appropriate forum?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The <em>Spiliada</em> test is essentially a factors-based test: the weight to be placed on the various factors varies with each factual matrix. What may prove to be critical in one case might not be that important in another. However, as noted by the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> <b>(“</b><b><em>BDA</em></b><b>”</b>) at [24], residence appears to be an important factor:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Thus, where a defendant seeking a stay is working and residing in Singapore, there lies a greater evidential burden on him: the countervailing factors adduced in favour of the stay have to be correspondingly more convincing, in comparison to the hypothetical factual matrix, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, where the defendant is not resident in Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>BDA</em>, the parties were similarly Indian nationals and the wife had also made a s. 69 application for maintenance. The husband was resident in and employed in Singapore. The wife and the child were previously residing in Singapore but had left for India before the s. 69 application was filed. Parties were Singapore permanent residents. The husband commenced divorce proceedings in India shortly after the s. 69 application was filed. On appeal, the High Court dismissed the husband’s stay application. The Court noted, that the wife had instituted the maintenance application in Singapore, where the husband resided and worked. The Court also noted that the pending divorce proceedings instituted by the husband in India was not for the same relief as that claimed by the wife in her s. 69 maintenance application in Singapore. The former would result in the termination of the marriage, with the wife being entitled to apply for post-divorce maintenance while the latter was premised on the subsistence of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the instant case, the parties and the Child are presently residing in Singapore. While parties and the Child are Indian nationals, nationality <em>per se</em> is of limited significance as noted by the High Court in <em>BDA</em> at [29]. Parties are working in Singapore on their respective employment passes and are earning income from their work here. The Child is also presently enrolled in nursery in Singapore. The relevant living expenses of the Wife and the Child are incurred in Singapore. The marriage still subsists. If the matter is heard in India, both parties would have to travel from Singapore to India to attend to this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While the Husband contends that parties’ stay in Singapore was temporary in nature and could be terminated at any point if their respective employment passes were not renewed, I did not think this was a strong factor to grant a stay as there was no evidence put before me that suggested that parties were at imminent risk of losing their jobs or that their employment passes would be terminated. In any event, should circumstances change, parties may make the appropriate application (if necessary) to vary and/or rescind any maintenance orders that have been made in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Further, any maintenance order made in MSS 1289 would be temporary in nature for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Any spousal maintenance order made in MSS 1289 would cease to operate once the divorce proceedings have concluded in India and the Wife ceases to be a “wife” married to the Husband under the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The child maintenance order would also be superseded by any ancillary orders made by the Indian Court in relation to child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I also did not agree with the Husband that there was an issue of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> arising. The pending divorce proceedings instituted by the Husband in India (which deals with reliefs arising post-termination of marriage) was not for the same relief as that claimed by the Wife in the present maintenance application in Singapore. MSS 1289 (at least in respect of the Wife’s claim for spousal maintenance) is premised on the subsistence of the marriage and any child maintenance order made in Singapore in these proceedings would similarly be overtaken by the ancillary orders made by the Indian Court. Thus, both proceedings are distinct and do not cover the same grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I also address the Husband’s argument that the decision made by the learned Deputy Presiding Judge to stay the Singapore divorce proceedings in D 5293 was binding on this Court. Firstly, no legal basis was put forward as why the outcome of the stay application in D 5293 would be binding on this court. Secondly, the granting of the Husband’s stay application in D 5293 meant that Singapore was not the appropriate forum to deal with the divorce and ancillary issues. However, as stated above, the issues being raised in the application in MSS 1289 were not covering the same ground as the divorce proceedings in India. Finally, the Husband’s argument that any maintenance orders made in MSS 1289 would interfere with the Indian divorce proceedings and complicate the overall financial adjudication was not convincing. There were no specifics provided by the Husband beyond this bare assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Ultimately, as stated by the Court in <em>BDA</em>, two questions must be addressed by the court in a s 69 application. First, the wife must show that she needs maintenance and that the husband has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her and any child of the marriage. Second, the court will have to determine the quantum required for maintenance. On the first question, the court in Singapore is as well placed as any other to decide on the issue. As regards the second question, it would appear that the Singapore Court would be better placed to decide on this issue. First, the parties and the Child are presently residing in Singapore. Second, in determining the quantum of maintenance, the court shall have to take into account the standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and the Child before the Husband’s neglect or refusal to maintain them (see s 69(4)(f) of the Women’s Charter) and the present maintenance that they require. These determinations would be based on their expenses incurred in Singapore since they have been and are presently residing in Singapore. In this regard, the Singapore court would have an advantage over the Indian court in making these determinations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the reasons set out above, I find that the Husband has not discharged the burden of showing that India is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum. Therefore, based on stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, MSS 1289 should not be stayed. There is then no need to go on to consider stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Husband’s application to stay the proceedings in MSS 1289 is dismissed.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Guardianship – Welfare of child","Family Law – Custody – Care and Control – Access"],"date":"2025-04-30","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act 1934) No 77/2024, FC/Summons 3478/2024","title":"XLJ v XLK","citation":"[2025] SGFC 42","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33199-SSP.xml","counsel":["Cornelius Sng (Advox Law LLC) for the Applicant in OSG 77 /2024 and Respondent in Summons 3478/2024","Respondent in person in OSG 77/2024 and Applicant in Person in Summons 3478/2024"],"timestamp":"2025-05-08T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XLJ v XLK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XLJ <em>v</em> XLK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33199-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 42</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act 1934) No 77/2024, FC/Summons 3478/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">30 April 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Cornelius Sng (Advox Law LLC) for the Applicant in OSG 77 /2024 and Respondent in Summons 3478/2024; Respondent in person in OSG 77/2024 and Applicant in Person in Summons 3478/2024 </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XLJ — XLK </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Guardianship</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Welfare of child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Custody</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Care and Control</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Access</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">30 April 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act 1934) No 77/2024 (“OSG 77”) was an application filed by the Applicant (“Mother”) on 18 June 2024 under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 for sole custody, care and control of the child and for the Respondent (“Father”) to take all required steps to facilitate the handing over of the child to the Mother. The Mother also applied for the Father to surrender the child's passport to the Mother or to her solicitors forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother alleged the Father had unlawfully removed the child from her lawful custody in China and eventually brought the child into Singapore. He had also refused to return the child to the Mother though she was granted custody of the child by the Chinese Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Pending the final determination of OSG 77, the Mother filed for an injunction in Summons No 1903/2024 to prevent the Father from bringing the child out of Singapore without the Mother’s written consent or an Order of Court. An injunction was granted to prevent both parties from removing the child out of Singapore without the consent of the Court or the written consent of the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 7 November 2024, the Father filed Summons 3478/2024 (“Summons 3478”) for orders that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_I\"></a>I)     The parties have joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II\"></a>II)     The Mother have care and control of the child, on the condition that the Father shall have liberal access, including overnight and overseas access, to the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Regular Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_a\"></a>(a)       On weekdays, the Father have access on at least two weekdays a week, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_b\"></a>(b)       The Father have access during the weekends, from Saturday after lunch to Sunday after lunch, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Specific Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_c\"></a>(c)       In addition to the regular access, both parties shall endeavour to celebrate the child’s birthday together as a family at such date/time to be mutually agreed in writing and in advance.

The First Instance Court did not make its decision immediately and deferred it to another day. Pending the decision, the Mother alleged that the Father took the child away forcefully from her on 28 June 2023. The Father denied doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 7 August 2023, the First Instance Court granted the divorce and ordered, amongst other things, that the child “shall be raised and educated” by the Mother. The following were the court’s findings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Considering that [the Child] is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by [the Mother]. Therefore, [the Child] … shall be raised and educated by [the Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Dissatisfied with the decision, the Father appealed to the Intermediate People’s Court of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China (“Appellate Court”). The Appellate Court, whose decision is final, upheld the decision of the First Instance Court on 23 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother subsequently found out that the Father and the child came to Singapore on 11 December 2023 based on a copy of the child’s Visit Pass issued by the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoint Authority. The Mother had not seen the child from 28 June 2023 till 11 December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Consequent to the Father’s failure to comply with the two Court decisions, the Mother applied for enforcement of the court orders against the Father. A Written Decision of Detention dated 9 February 2024, and a Written Decision of Enforcement dated 27 February 2024 were issued by the Court of First Instance and the Appellate Court respectively. In the Written Decision of Detention, the Court decided that the Father be detained for 15 days for the non -compliance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. In the Written Decision of Enforcement, the Appellate Court issued an order to prevent the Father from leaving the country and cancelled his travel documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Despite these orders, the Father still did not return the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Further, on 8 April 2024, a Notice of Order to Fulfil was issued against the Father by the Appellate Court to hand over the child’s identity card and travel documents to the Mother for safe keeping<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. According to the Father, by this time he was no longer in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother filed OSG 77 on 18 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 9 September 2024, the Father filed an application in another court in China, the Hangzhou Xihu District People’s Court (“Hangzhou Court”) for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> . The application was still pending when OSG 77 was heard. To date, the child remained in Singapore with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother was represented throughout the proceedings. The Father was also represented during the pre-trial proceedings but chose to act in person just before the hearing of both applications. Both parties submitted written submissions which were considered, together with the oral submissions, before the decisions were made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     There was a total of 13 affidavits filed for purposes of OSG 77 and Summons 3478.

She had taken care of him full time from birth on 22 January 2019 to the year 2022. He was still young and dependent on her as his mother and that it would be in the child’s best interest and more conducive for his development that he be raised and cared for by her as the primary caregiver. She informed that the child had lived for most of his life in China and would benefit from her looking after him in an environment he is familiar with. She disagreed that he should be uprooted from China to settle down in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     She contended that the Chinese courts has awarded her sole custody of the child. The Father has never discussed with her and that she has not given consent for the child to be taken out of China. She also contended that having sole custody, care and control of the child is in line with the Chinese’s Court’s findings and decisions. The child also has a strong support system with her as well as with her father, a retired civil servant, who is living with her and willing to assist in taking care of and raising the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Before being taken away by the Father, the child was studying in kindergarten and could resume in an environment he is familiar with. The Mother works as an insurance agent and event planner which gave her autonomy and flexible working hours to enable her to tend to the child’s day to day needs including ferrying the child for his daily activities. This is despite her busy schedule. She has also enrolled the child in various other classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     She informed that she is more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. She also offered to discuss the issue of access with the Father, but he has been avoiding the matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Father only reached out to her via WeChat after the application was filed by her. As for the video calls sessions he arranged for her with the child, the timings were not suitable as they coincided with the child’s play time. She denied the Father’s allegations that she is the cause of the tension in the marriage and that in reality, the Father was engaged in extra-marital affair and neglected the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the 1st Instance Court Mother was relying on <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With regards to the issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the 1<sup>st</sup> Instance Court on 7 August 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody, that is, (name of child)’s custody. Through the evidence adduced by both parties and the court investigation, the court notes that both the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as their parents, have great care and love for (the child), and that the parties have inseparable feelings for their child. Considering that (the child) is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by (the Mother). Therefore, (name of child), the legitimate son of the parties, shall be raised and educated by (the Mother) and the defendant shall pay the plaintiff a monthly maintenance of CNY 3,000 until (the child) lives on his own. Accordingly, as per Article 1079, Article 1084, Article 1085 and Article 1087 of the Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, the court hereby makes the following judgments:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">1.    (The Mother), the plaintiff, and (the Father), the defendant, are granted divorce;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    (The Child), the legitimate son of both parties shall be raised and educated by (the Mother), and (the Father) shall pay child’s support of CNY 3,000 before the 15th of each month from the month when the judgments take effect until (the child) independent life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the Appellate Court the Mother was relying on </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On the same issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the Appellate Court on 23 Nov 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> :</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The determination of custody shall be deemed on the specific circumstances of his parents and judged in accordance with the principles that is the most favourable to the minor child. From the birth to 2021, the legitimate son was raised full-time by (the Mother), the appellee and he is currently only four years old. From the perspective of the law of the physical and mental development of the young child, relatively he is more dependent on his mother at this age stage. At present his cognitive ability has not yet fully developed due to his young age. So the ownership of his custody cannot be decided with his cognition only. At the same time, according to the statements of both parties at the trial, the legitimate son is temporarily living with (the Father) during the first-instance litigation of the case due to the conflict between both parties taking care of him in turn. Therefore it is not enough to conclude that he has had a relatively stable living and growing environment. In addition, (the Mother) has the ability and conditions to raise the child. Although (the Father) advocates that (the Moher) is not suitable to raise him, he does not adduce any evidence to prove that she has obvious unfavourable circumstances for raising the child. In view of the above factors, this court holds that the court of first instance should be correct in ordering the legitimate son to be raised and educated by (the Mother) in accordance with the principle that is most beneficial to underage child and in determining that the Father should pay monthly maintenance of CNY3,000 to the legitimate son until he lives on his own on the basis of his actual needs and the level of local consumption etc. It is hoped that both parties can put aside disputes in the future, negotiate amicably on the issues such as visitation from the perspective of maximising the interest of the child, avoid conflicts, try to reduce the possible adverse effects of parental divorce on him and ensure that he can enjoy the companionship and love of both parents and grow up healthy and strong in a peaceful , tranquil and friendly living environment. In summary, according to Article 177, Paragraph1 (1) of Law of the Peoples’ Republic of China on Civil Procedure, this court decides as follows: dismiss the appeal and uphold the original judgment... This judgment is final.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother submitted her solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit of 17 December 2024. The solicitor is a practicing lawyer in China whose area of expertise included dealing with civil cases such as family division and divorce. He was engaged by the Mother to respond to the legal opinion of the Father’s solicitor dated 5 September and 26 October 2024 which were found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Mother posed a total of 16 questions for her solicitor’s legal opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The more relevant questions and the responses of the Father and Mother’s solicitor are set out below for ease of comparison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The following question is relevant on the issue of custody:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    What responsibilities and rights do the Mother has regarding the child under the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Father’s solicitor: The Chinese Court order states that the Mother has the responsibility and right to raise and educate the child. This implies that the Mother is entitled to live with the child, as well as the obligation to raise and take care of, provide daily necessities to, cultivate, and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Mother’s solicitor: Under the Chinese Court Judgment, the Mother has the responsibility and right to directly raise and educate the child. This includes the right to live with the child, as well as the responsibility to nurture, care for, provide for the child’s daily needs, and foster the child’s education and development. The Mother also has the right to make decisions about the child’s living arrangements and educational matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On access or visitation rights, the solicitors’ opinion on the various issues was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What access or visitation rights does the Father have according to the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: The Father’s right to the child include the rights to contact, associate with, meet, visit, accompany, look after, protect, educate, and live together for short periods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Father’s solicitor response to (k) that the Father has the right to live with the child for a short period, the Mother has asked her solicitor as to what is the upper limit of &quot;short-term&quot; and his response was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Under Chinese law and judicial interpretations, there is no legal definition or upper limit for &quot;short-term.&quot; Living with the child for a &quot;short-term&quot; period requires the consent of the direct custodian and exceeds the scope of visitation rights. Visitation rights typically involve supervised visits during agreed-upon times, without the right to take the child away. In this case, the Father never agreed with the Mother on how visitation would occur. Instead, the Father forcibly took the child away before the court's judgment and, after the judgment was issued, left the country and refused to comply with the Chinese court’s ruling. The Mother never consented to the Father taking the child out of the country or to the child living with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(l)    What is the legal procedure for enforcing visitation rights in China?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Chinese law grants the parent who is not directly responsible for the care of the child the right to access the child. The parent may file an application to request that the court set the schedule and terms of access. The court shall accept the application of the person who has the right of access and make a judgment on the time and manner of access in accordance with the law. If the party who directly raises the child refuses to facilitate the access rights holder in enforcing the access rights after the judgment has entered into force, the access rights holder may petition the court for execution. The execution approach taken by the court is mainly to persuade the party who directly raises the child to do so voluntarily, the court may penalise him/her by imposing a fine, detention, or other measures. Nonetheless, the court hardly ever impose fines or incarceration on the parent who is raising the child directly in order to protect the child from potential harm. Therefore, if the party directly raising the child does not voluntarily fulfill the responsibility of assisting access, the access rights of the access parent will not be realised. The enforcement of access rights has always been a challenging matter in Chinese legal practice because the party who is directly responsible for the care of the child typically does not cooperate with access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to Article 1086 of the Civil Code, after a divorce, the parent who does not directly raise the child has the right to visit the child, while the other parent has the obligation to facilitate this. The method and timing of visitation are to be agreed upon by both parties. If no agreement is reached, the people’s court will make a ruling. If visitation is deemed harmful to the child’s physical or mental health, the court may suspend visitation. Once the reasons for suspension no longer exist, visitation rights should be restored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The custodial parent typically provides visitation rights twice a month. If the custodial parent does not cooperate with visitation arrangements, the non-custodial parent may file a lawsuit with the court to request a judicial determination of the visitation schedule and method. The court must accept the application and issue a ruling on the timing and manner of visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Once the ruling takes effect, if the custodial parent refuses to facilitate visitation, the non-custodial parent can apply to the court for compulsory enforcement. The court will initially attempt to persuade the custodial parent to voluntarily comply and fulfil their obligation to assist with visitation. If the custodial parent continues to refuse, the court may impose penalties, including fines, detention, or even criminal charges. The custodial parent cannot refuse enforcement measures, as failure to comply without valid reason could result in criminal liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(n)    Under Chinese law, does the Father have any measures to prevent being deprived of visitation rights to the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Under Chinese law, the Father does not have any measures to prevent being deprived of the right to have access to the child. The Father will have to take legal action to exercise his right to have access to the child if the Mother refuses to facilitate the same. However, even if the Father exercises his right of access through legal proceedings, if the Mother still does not facilitate access, the Father’s right of access to the child cannot be realised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Visitation rights are a common issue in many divorce cases across China. As a country with a well established judicial system, Chinese law ensures that if the Mother attempts to deprive the Father of visitation rights, the Father can file a lawsuit. The court will rule on the method and schedule of visitation. If the judgment or ruling is not complied with, the responsible party may face criminal liability. Under current Chinese law, unless a court determines that visitation by the Father is harmful to the child, no one has the authority to deprive the Father of visitation rights to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In relation to the question of who could decide on the child’s care and education arrangements, the Father’s solicitor has provided his legal opinion on question “(d)” as to what are the Father’s responsibilities and rights under the Notice of Order for Performance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The Mother’s solicitor asked her solicitor to elaborate on the practical effect of the Father being the child's &quot;legal guardian&quot; and having &quot;the same responsibilities and rights to raise and educate the child as the Mother&quot; and which party has the authority to decide the child's care and education arrangements?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: According to the Notice of Order for Performance, the Father has the responsibility to hand over the child to the Mother for caregiving. Pursuant to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the Peoples Republic of China, “The parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children. Whether the children are raised by their mother or father after the parent’s divorce, they will always be the children of both parents. Parents still have the right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following divorce.” Although the Mother is currently the caregiver of the child, according to the Chinese Court Order, and has the right to live with the child, the right of caregiving is not unchangeable, and the Father has the right to apply for a change in the caregiver of the child at any time by filing an application. At the same time, even if the caregiver is not changes, the Father is still the child’s legal guardian and has the same responsibility and right as the Moher to raise and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to the Civil Code and relevant provisions, the Shangcheng District People's Court of Hangzhou issued Civil Judgment (2023) Zhe 0102 Min Chu 7390, determining that the Mother is the child’s direct custodian. The child's direct custody by the Mother is protected by the court and enforceable through compulsory measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under the Civil Code, the direct custodian is the parent living with the child, who has the authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education. The direct custodian holds a higher guardianship status. In this case, the Mother, as the direct custodian, has the sole authority to arrange the child's living conditions and educational plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Legal guardianship based on blood relations (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings, etc.) is supplementary. If the direct custodian is unable to fulfil their duties, other guardians have the right and obligation to take on the role of direct custodian. However, their guardianship primarily serves a supporting and supervisory role. This legislative intent aligns closely with similar provisions in Singaporean law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the Mother’s submission, counsel raised that the only relevant issue for the court’s determination is whether the child’s best interest is served by granting the Mother sole custody or joint custody of the child. It was submitted that it is in the best interest of the child for sole custody to be granted to her citing the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the child’s needs are best fulfilled by the Mother who is the child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the father has not acted in the child’s best interest at all by unilaterally and forcibly removing the child from the Mother’s care; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the parties and the child have no connection to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Counsel for the Mother also pointed out that the crux of the Father’s application appeared to be his purported concern and fear about being deprived on access to the child if sole custody was granted to the Mother and he was brought back to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Counsel also submitted that granting the Father’s application for custody would “effectively endorse and legitimise de facto child abduction by the Father” and in effect, be rewarding the Father for his blatant disregard of existing Chinese court orders. It would also create a dangerous precedent, incentivising parents to flout court orders and unlawfully disrupt their children’s lives in hopes of gaining a more favourable outcome in a different and further encourage further manipulations of legal processes. Finally, granting custody to the Father would send a troubling message that the legal system permits parents to exploit legal loopholes, uprooting children from stable environments and manipulating the law to further their own interests. Such conduct should not be tolerated, as it undermines the very principles of justice and fairness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Father informed that since the application in OSG 77 was filed by the Mother, both parties made substantial efforts to resolve the matter amicably but were unsuccessful. He denied that he had taken the child forcibly from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     During the marriage both parties and the child lived in their matrimonial home and on weekends, the child would stay with his parent’s residence and joined by the Mother at times. Since the child was born, he has been involved in caring for him as he had a stable job with fixed working hours and was able to work overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     After April 2021, due to the Mother’s job as insurance agent, she was frequently occupied even at night. At the hearing of the first instance court, he had submitted his evidence to show the Mother was too busy to look after the child and often left him to his care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father related various significant events during the marriage where they had frequent disagreements wherein the Mother would often be emotionally unstable, acted out in front of the child and in these disagreements, the Mother would take the child away from the matrimonial home to the Mother’s parent’s residence. He also related various attempts by the Mother to gain an advantage in the divorce proceedings by using the child as a pawn and other past conduct, which he had also raised before the Chinese Courts which eventually gave the right to raise and educate the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 28 June 2023, the Father had gone to the Mother’s parent’s residence to take the child according to the parties’ agreed scheduled but was refused by the Mother. Despite that, he managed to leave the place with the child and due to the Mother’s persistent conduct of denying him access, he was afraid to hand the child back to her the following weekend and thereafter. His attempt to resolve the matter through a third party also failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     After taking the child into his care, he took 2 months of extended leave to take the child on holiday, brought him and his parents to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Huizhou and Guangzhou, enrolled him in a pre-school near his parent’s residence. In November 2023, he brought the child to Phuket Thailand and on 11 December 2023 brought him to Singapore where he intended to have him commence his formal education in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father enrolled the child into the Australian International School on 22 January 2024 which he claimed to be what the parties has agreed to some time back. He contended that the child was comfortable living with him since 28 June 2023 and performing well at school. He shared the child’s daily routine where he would send and fetch the child from school and on weekends would accompany him to swimming classes or other activities. The Father lived here with his retired mother who was on a Long Term Visit Pass and who could assist with the care-giving duties. He believed it would be in the child’s best interest that he remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Father informed that it was important that the access orders he was seeking in his summons are recorded in an Order of Court. This was because the 7 August 2023 Order (in China) did not specify any access for him, or any contact with the child would continue with him as his father. In view of the Mother’s past conduct of denying access he was deeply concerned that he would be excluded completely from the child’s life once the child return to China. He was advised by his Chinese lawyers and believed that the Chinese Courts do not ordinarily make specific orders on access and expect parties to resolve the issue of access on their own<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. Based on past events, both parties were not able to resolve the issue of access and thus wished for his access to the child to be crystallised in an Order of Court to be mirrored by-consent in China so that his right to have time with the child in China would be preserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     With regards to the decision of the Appellate Court, the Father contended that the Court has erred in their judgment. He was aware of the Written Decision of Detention, the Written Decision of Enforcement and the Notice of Order to Fulfil issued against him but claimed that he was in Singapore by the time these decisions were made and was not served with these decisions. He contended that these orders do not have any extraterritorial effect though he would likely be subject to them upon his return to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father relied on his solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024 and 18 February 2025. The solicitor has been practicing in China for 23 years specialising in economic and matrimonial cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Father posed 9 questions set out in the solicitor’s affidavit of 10 December and a further 8 questions set out in the 18 February affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Based on the legal opinion given, in relation to the Court order, the Father disagreed that the order was clear as to the issue of the child’s custody, care and control. The words of the 7 August 2023 Order stated that the child “… shall be raised and educated by [the Mother]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father’s reasons were, firstly, there is no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and he was advised and believed that it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. It is therefore inaccurate and misleading for the Mother to allege that she had been granted “sole custody” of the child. This position completely ignores the default position in Chinese law, which he explained in the paragraph below. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     According to his solicitor’s legal opinion, the default position under Chinese law is that “the parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children.” According to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, both parents are the joint legal guardians of the child and share a joint “right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following a divorce.” As could be seen from the Chinese Legal Opinion, the Father has an equal say in long-term major decisions relating to the child ’s care under Chinese law and the Mother should not seek to deprive him of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father submitted written submissions which were likely prepared by himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In his oral submission, on the day in question, he took the child away because the Mother did not abide to their agreement for him to see the child on alternate weekdays and rejected his request to see the child. He thus had no choice but to bring the child home on that day. He was not allowed to see the child on 25 to 27 June though the child who was sick earlier, had recovered. She had subsequently called the police and harassed his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     He reiterated that the parties had agreed to the child receiving education in Singapore due to its bilingual system, and the culture was similar to China. They also had thoughts of Australia but he encountered issues with the visa requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     He claimed that the Mother succeeded in her case in China due to her connections (which the Mother counsel denied in rebuttal). He also claimed that the Mother knew he was coming to Singapore with intent to mediate the case. The Mother didn’t want to agree on access as she knew that in China, his request would not be granted. He agreed to allow the Mother access via video call when she came to Singapore but claimed that between 23 July and 12 August, she did not make any call or visited the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For 21 months, he solely took care of the child who became dependent on him, was very happy, made good progress in school and able to converse in 2 languages. He disagreed that he brought the child here for his own self-interest and that had resigned from his job to take care of the child with his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As he had filed for a variation of the order in China, he made an oral application that the decision of the court in the two applications before me be deferred to after 3 April 2025 which was the date of his variation application in the Hangzhou Court in China. He relied on the rest of his written submissions and affidavits filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In deciding the two applications, I considered the issues set out below as pertinent and relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Is it in interest of the child for him to be return to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(a)   Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I construed the order made by the Chinese Courts as an order for custody which was granted to the Mother. This was borne out even by the judgement of the Court as the word “custody” was used based on the translation made by a neutral third party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The relevant translated grounds of decision of the First Instance Court contained the following statement made by the court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody that is (“the Child”)’s custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The finding by the Court on the above dispute was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">.. it shall be more conducive to his health, growth for him to be raised and educated by Chen Li Ying. Therefore (“the Child”) shall be raised and educated by (“the Mother”) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Based on the above, I came to the view that the Chinese Courts gave the Mother sole custody of the child. This was also supported by the Mother’s solicitor’s opinion in paragraph 32 above which stated that the Mother is the direct custodian of the child and has the sole authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">b)   If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Singapore Courts in dealing with issues involving children which are not of local born has given guidance on the approach to be taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0570.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 570</a>, the Court stated that in custody proceedings, an important consideration had to be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum served. A child’s best interest was best determined by the forum which was best equipped to determine what was best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In this case, the issue of custody had been decided by the court in China which has the closest connection to the parties and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In matters which has been decided by a foreign Court, the Court in <em>AB v AC and Another Application</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27027-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 6</a>, at paragraph 15 of the decision, cited a High Court decision in <em>Igra v Igra</em> [1951] P 404 which held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It has long been accepted that the court of the domicile is the proper tribunal to dissolve a marriage. Its decisions should as far as possible, be acknowledged by other countries in the interests of comity. Different countries have different personal laws, different standards of justice and different practice. The interests of comity are not served if one country is too eager to criticise the standards of another country or too reluctant to recognise decrees that are valid by the law of the domicile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the above case was in relation to dissolution of marriages, the same could apply to ancillary matters. The issue of custody had been litigated extensively in China including at the Appellate Court level whose decision is final. It is important to note that the Father admitted that he had presented to the Court the evidence which he had also submitted to this Court and despite that, an order was made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As there is already an order made on the custody of the child by the Chinese Courts, it would not be in the interest of comity of nations if a Singapore Court is to make another order of custody. By comity I mean that there must be respect between countries shown by accepting each other’s laws, even where there is no reciprocal arrangement to recognise orders made by the two countries. The Father participated in the proceedings in both the courts which culminated in a final decision made by an appellate court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">c)   As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father’s main concern was that the orders made, specifically the 7 August 2023 Order by the First Instance Court did not specify any access for him. This was also reflected in the various prayers sought in his summons including his prayer for mirror orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     On the issue of access or visitation rights, the Mother’s solicitors provided the following insights on Chinese law:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What visitation rights does the Father has according to the Chinese court judgment?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Both solicitors informed that there are also legal grounds under the Chinese law for a variation of a child custody order. They also pointed out that there are safeguards available for the Father should he be denied access such as fines imposed by the Chinese courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Of the two, I was of the view that the Mother’s solicitor interpretation of the court orders and opinion on the relevant issues were more reliable for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s solicitor opined that the Father has not violated the Chinese Court Orders simply because they can be varied. I agreed with the Mother’s counsel that the Father’s solicitor’s opinion is non-sensical.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s solicitor must have advised the Father who was made to believe that in the Appellate Court order, there was no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and thus it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. This was despite the court referring to the order as the order for custody of the child, based on the translation of the court decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father’s solicitor’s interpretation of the court order went against the grain of the two Chinese Court Order when he opined that “After divorcing (the Mother), (the Father) … has the same responsibility and right as (the Mother) to raise, take care of, and educate (the child).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I further note that the Father himself had applied to another Court in China, the Hangzhou Court, for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him which application was still pending when OSG 77 and the above-mentioned summons were heard. This was one of the factors which I took into account in dismissing the summons filed by the Father based on <em>Re A</em>’s case. In <em>Re A</em>’s case, the father himself had chosen to have the issues of custody and access determined by the foreign court. As such, any appeal or application in relation to custody or access should be litigated or re-litigated in China by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">d)   Is it in interest of the child for him to be returned to the Applicant Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     This is the crux of the matter at hand. In OSG 77, the Mother has applied under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934. She asked that she be given sole custody, care and control of the child and for the Father to hand over the child and his travel document to her. In essence, she was asking that the child to be returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In deciding matters relating custody of children, the overarching principle is found in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The welfare of the child is thus the first and paramount consideration and in particular the court ought to have some regard to the maternal bond between the mother and child as held in <em>Soon Peck Wah</em> v <em>Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>. The Court therein emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. The Court, upon finding that the parents were both capable of looking after the child and had their respective families behind them to help out, stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All these things being equal between the father and mother, a very important factor to bear in mind was the fact that the child was very young. A child at a very tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. This should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care: at [44] and [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Further, in <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a>, the Court of Appeal outlined a non-exhaustive list of factors that the courts should consider, including the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Court stated that the above factors afford a sound starting basis for any court concerned with the issue of the child’s welfare and that factors (a) and (b) are closely related and should generally be considered in tandem. Further, the relevance of these or any other factors to a particular case, and the weight that should be given to each of the factors, is a matter of judgment and will turn on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis of the child’s best interest</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The child was 4 plus years old when he was taken away by the Father and when the application was heard, was 6 plus years old. The court in <em>Soon Pek Wah</em>’s case emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. This was also acknowledged by the First Instance Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> which made a finding that the child is still young and has endless dependence on his mother and thus it “shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by” the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     As for the child educational needs, prior to being taken away, he was in kindergarten. The Mother had enrolled the child in various other classes. After being taken away, he was placed by the Father in an international school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     While the child educational needs could be met either by him remaining in China or Singapore, the fact that the child is young weighed in favour of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Mother stated that she works as an insurance agent and event planner, and this gave her autonomy and flexibility in her working hours to attend to the child’s needs. She is supported by her retired father to attend to the child in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father’s occupation after he left his company of 10 years on 22 November 2023 was not made known in his affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s mother who was on Long Term Visit Pass lived with the child who has been issued with a Student Pass. The Father informed that his mother’s Long Term Visit Pass was tied to the child’s Student Pass. The Father also informed that he had applied for a Long Term Visit Pass which was also tied to the child’s Student Pass<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. It was not clear what his long term plans are. If he were to return to China, we would have to deal with the orders made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Based on the above, I was of the view the Mother would be able to provide a more stable environment for the child’s needs, growth and safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I did not find any evidence of any wrong-doing or anything against the Mother or any of her immediate family with regards to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It is well recognised that it is in a child’s best interests post-divorce for him to maintain a good relationship with both his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Mother informed that she was more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law. According to the Mother’s solicitor, the method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Father on the other hand, instead of going back to the Chinese courts, had taken things into his own hands and had not allowed the Mother to have access to the child for long periods after the Father took the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In my view, this factor weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The child was taken out of China and brought to Singapore where he was enrolled into a school so that he could be bilingual. Whilst the child had been in Singapore since December 2023, he had lived most of his life in China and taken care of by the Mother on full time basis from January 2019 to 2022 when the Mother started work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Bearing in mind the importance of maternal bond, especially for young children as stated in Soon Peck Wah’s case, this factor also weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the parents’ character and conduct</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     This was an additional factor which the court in <em>TSF v TSE</em> took into account in determining welfare of the child. The Father clearly had brought the child out of China for his own interest after he disagreed with the two court orders. Based on the evidence, the circumstances supported the Mother’s claim that the child was taken away from her without her consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Father’s conduct had also led to the issuance of enforcement orders against him. The Father appeared not to have taken the orders seriously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     Having considered the above factors and the circumstances of the case, in the context of our guardianship laws, I came to the view that it is in the child’s best interest for the Mother to be granted care and control of the child. To enable the Mother to exercise this right, bearing in mind that there is already a custody order made by the Chinese court, I ordered that she be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to China with the Mother. I also granted the Mother her second prayer to facilitate the return of the child. Consequently, I dismissed the Father’s application in Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In summary, I made the orders in OSG 77 and dismissed Summons 3478 for following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is in the best interest of the child that the Mother be given care and control of the child, and to enable the Mother to exercise this right, for her to also be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the order made in the main application in OSG 77 which would result in the child being returned to the Mother in China, the child would not be within the jurisdiction requiring any other order for custody, care and control or access to be exercised by any of the parties including the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There are existing orders for custody made by the Chinese Courts that had jurisdiction when the orders were made and will continue to have jurisdiction over the parties. It would be against the comity of nations for another jurisdiction to make another or further order or others on the same matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_d\"></a>(d)     It was open for the Father to litigate the issue relating to the child including his access in China which is the proper forum. There is thus no necessity for a Singapore Court to even consider the mirror orders requested for by the Father. The Father should also deal with the orders made against him for his non-compliance with the two Chinese court orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Lastly, I did not grant the Father’s application to defer my decision on the matter pending the conclusion of the proceedings filed by him in the Hangzhou Court so as not to further prolong the separation of the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     On the issue of costs, the Mother’s solicitor sought $6,000 for OSG 77 and $4,000 for dismissal of Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The powers of the court to fix and assess costs is found in rule 851(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”). Rule 852(2) of the FJR states that costs should “follow the event” except where the court considers that “in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as the whole or part of the costs”. I was of the view that the Father should pay the costs for both sets of applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     There was a total of 13 affidavits filed for the two applications. Several case conferences and court attendances were conducted before the hearing which took close to two hours. An application for an injunction was also made and granted.

To succeed, the party must prove that the PPO is no longer necessary. What must the party establish to satisfy this requirement? The present case presents an opportunity to address this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In February 2023, the Respondent obtained a PPO against the Applicant, her ex-husband: PPO xx4/2023 (“<b>PPO xx4</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In June 2024, the Applicant applied to revoke PPO xx4. Among others, he submitted that after the PPO was issued, (a) the parties have lived in different households and (b) the Respondent did not make any more allegation of family violence against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Applicant added that the continuation of the PPO would impede his efforts to normalise his relationship with his children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Respondent strenuously objected to the revocation of PPO xx4. Among others, she alleged that the Applicant had continued to harass her after the PPO was issued, and that she was fearful that he would physically harm her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Before dealing with the parties’ contentions, it is useful to summarise the principles for revoking a PPO. They are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Applicant’s legal burden of proof</em>. To begin, a party applying to revoke a PPO (“<b>applicant</b>”) has the legal burden of proof – i.e., he/she must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the <em>PPO is no longer necessary to protect the person stated in the order</em> (“<b>respondent</b>”). This legal burden remains with the applicant throughout the revocation proceedings: s 103 of the Evidence Act 1893 (“<b>Evidence Act</b>”). In other words, the respondent does not have the legal burden to prove that the PPO is still necessary: <em>AZB v AYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a> at [28]; <em>Joycelyn Toh Hui Yu v Toh Siew Luan Bette</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0275.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 275</a> (“<b><em>Joycelyn Toh</em></b>”) at [17(e)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Discharging the legal burden</em>. In determining whether the applicant has discharged his burden of proof, the relevant considerations include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)       Why was the PPO issued against the applicant in the first place? See e.g., <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [15] to [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       Has there been any incident of family violence <em>after</em> the PPO was issued? See e.g., <em>XGG v XGH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32623-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 111</a> at [35(c)], [36] and [39]. If the answer is yes, then it is generally not appropriate to revoke the PPO unless –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_1\"></a>(1)       The violence is very dated: see e.g., <em>XEF v XEG</em> [2024] 92 (“<b><em>XEF</em></b>”) at [20(b)],</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_2\"></a>(2)       The harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. (This well-established principle has sometimes been expressed as <em>de minimis non curat lex</em>), or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_3\"></a>(3)       The violence is committed in extenuating circumstances, e.g., due to intense provocation by the respondent: <em>VYR v VYS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26982-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 128</a> at [44] and [45]; <em>XEF</em> at [20(a)]; <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [49(a)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Has the respondent <em>abused</em> the PPO by using it to oppress or provoke the applicant – instead of for protection?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       Is the applicant likely to commit family violence in the future?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Material change of circumstances.</em> In determining the issue in [5(b)(iv)] above, an important consideration is whether there has been a material change in the circumstances since the PPO was issued – such that the applicant no longer has any opportunity or reason to commit family violence in future. Some factors that can be relevant to this consideration include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i_1\"></a>(i)       Has the underlying cause for family violence been resolved between the parties? See e.g., <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a> at [2] and [27(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii_2\"></a>(ii)       Are the parties likely to have future interactions with each other? If so, then what is the extent of such interactions, and are they likely to be opportunities/occasions for conflict and family violence?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii_3\"></a>(iii)       Is the applicant still deeply antagonistic towards the respondent?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv_4\"></a>(iv)       Does the applicant have a propensity for committing family violence? See e.g., <em>XEF</em> at [21(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Resisting a revocation application</em>. To resist an application to revoke a PPO, the respondent can assert, e.g., that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The applicant has committed family violence <em>after</em> the PPO was issued,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The applicant is likely to commit such violence in future,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>New issues</em> have surfaced after the PPO was issued and these may become flashpoints for the applicant to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>It bears highlighting that when the respondent makes assertions such as the above, he/she has the <em>evidential</em> burden of proving them on a balance of probabilities: s 105 of the Evidence Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Irrelevant matters</em>. For completeness, it is useful to add that in line with the <em>res judicata</em> principle, a court hearing a revocation application will proceed on the basis that the PPO has been validly issued in the first place. Accordingly –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i_5\"></a>(i)       The court will not review the correctness of the decision to issue the PPO: <em>Harvey Llewellyn Campbell v Angeline Yam Lai Lin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/51594-M.xml')\">[2006] SGDC 227</a> at [5] to [8]; <em>Joycelyn Toh</em> at [17(a)] and [17(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii_6\"></a>(ii)       Neither will the court consider –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_1_7\"></a>(1)       Arguments and evidence which have, or could have, been considered when the PPO was issued: <em>ACZ v ADC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/65077-M.xml')\">[2009] SGDC 457</a> (“<b><em>ACZ</em></b>”) at [13] and [25], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_2_8\"></a>(2)       Fresh evidence that may be relevant to the decision on whether to issue the PPO: <em>ACZ</em> at [15] and [22]; <em>AHQ v AHR</em> [2010] SGDC at [9], [13] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Having summarised the relevant principles, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for PPO xx4</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I begin by noting that PPO xx4 was issued for the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Family violence committed</em>. The judge who heard the Respondent’s PPO application (“<b>DJ Lee</b>”) found that the Applicant had, without the Respondent’s consent, installed CCTV cameras in their matrimonial home (“<b>Home</b>”) and an Air-Tag in her car. DJ Lee found that such acts constituted continual harassment and were done to cause anguish to the Respondent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>PPO was necessary</em>. DJ Lee had also found that a PPO was necessary because the Applicant was likely to have further contact with the Respondent due access and other arrangements regarding their three children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Did the Applicant continue to harass the Respondent </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I will move on to address the issue of whether the Applicant had continued to harass the Respondent after PPO xx4 was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged intrusions into the Respondent’s bedroom</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Respondent alleged that after the PPO was issued and while they were still staying together at the Home, the Applicant (a) had opened her bedroom door (without knocking), (b) had peered into her room when he had no reason to do so, and (c) would leave the room only when she took out her phone to either record or threaten to record him. She tendered a video recording of one such incident which occurred on 9 June 2024. The Respondent alleged that the Applicant knew that she would feel threatened by such intrusions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Regarding the video recording, the Applicant explained that the incident had occurred when he was taking over the care of the children. He was searching for his son at the material time when he noticed that the Respondent’s bedroom door was ajar. He decided to check the room to see if his son was there. According to the Applicant, he did not know that the Respondent was inside the room. He admitted that he should have checked before entering the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Respondent had failed to show that the Applicant had entered her bedroom to harass her. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I begin with the video recording of the 9 June incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the recording merely shows that the Applicant had (i) stuck his upper torso into the room from behind the door, (ii) peered around the room to look for someone (or something), (iii) glanced at the Respondent’s direction very briefly, and (iv) thereafter withdrawn his body from behind the door. The entire process lasted for only about 4 seconds. During this time, the Applicant had a neutral look on his face. He did not stare or make any gesture at the Respondent. Neither did he say anything to her. The recording did not show that the Applicant had harassed or intimidated the Respondent at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I find that the recording is more consistent with the Applicant’s explanation that he had peered into the Respondent’s room to look for his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Applicant’s explanation (that he was looking for his son at the material time) is inherently credible in view of the following <em>undisputed</em> facts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The 9 June incident took place at about 6.17 pm. This is shortly after 6.00 pm – the time when the Respondent was supposed to hand over the children to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The children could enter the Respondent’s room whenever they wanted. For instance, they would sometimes “hang out” in her room to use her iPad.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       The bedroom door was not closed before the Applicant peered into the room. If the Respondent did not want to be disturbed while she was in the room, she would have closed the door fully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to the Respondent’s allegation that apart from the 9 June incident, the Applicant had “intruded” into her bedroom on other occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I find this allegation to be too generic and bare of details. It is not clear, for instance, on which occasions and in what circumstances these intrusions had occurred. Such information is critical (i) to enable the Applicant to properly respond to the allegation, and (ii) for me to assess whether the allegation is credible and reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not tender video recordings of the Applicant’s “intrusions” into her bedroom <em>other than</em> the 9 June incident. This is puzzling, given the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Respondent, she had been advised by the Police to make recordings if the Applicant were to commit family violence against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Respondent did not dispute the Applicant’s evidence that she had made “a huge number of video recordings” of him at the Home after PPO xx4 was issued.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The admission of such video recordings would have supported the Respondent’s case that the Applicant had repeatedly “intruded” into her bedroom without any excuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, if the Respondent had felt either (i) harassed by the Applicant’s “intrusions” or (ii) fearful of him, then she could easily have installed a simple lock on the inside of her bedroom door to prevent such intrusions. Strangely, she failed to do so. I find her explanation for such a failure – that she could not afford to buy even a cheap lock – to be unconvincing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged obstruction of the Respondent’s passage at the Home</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I now turn to the Respondent’s next allegation of harassment. According to her, when the Applicant detected that she was leaving her bedroom to go to the ground floor, he would frequently (a) rush out of his bedroom and (b) stand at the top of the stairs leading to the ground floor to obstruct her passage or so that she had to walk close to him. The Respondent tendered a video recording of one such incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s allegation that the Applicant had regularly obstructed her from going down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, such an allegation is not borne out by the video recording that she had tendered as evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The recording shows the Respondent standing behind her bedroom door for about 6 seconds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When she opened the door, the Applicant also opened his bedroom door at about the same time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       On seeing the Respondent, the Applicant <em>turned away from her</em> direction and stood at the doorway to his bedroom – as if to let her pass him first.

A short while later, she opened the toilet door stepped out.

Soon thereafter, the Applicant walked down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       Throughout the incident the Applicant did not say anything to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not tender any other video recording to support her allegation that the Applicant had regularly obstructed her passage down the stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Handover of the children during the 2024 summer holiday</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will now address the Respondent’s next allegation of harassment. According to her, this took place during the children’s 2024 summer holiday in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The background to this incident is not disputed. In late June 2024, the Applicant left Singapore with the children for Bordeaux for the holiday. The Respondent left Singapore later – in early July – for Bergerac. The plan was for the Applicant to hand over the children to the Respondent in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s case is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant was supposed to hand over the children in <em>Bergerac</em>. The Respondent’s case is based on clause 16 of a court order issued in June 2024 (“<b>June 2024 Order</b>”). According to that clause, the Applicant shall “personally hand over” the children to the Respondent for the summer school holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Contrary to clause 16, the Applicant had wanted the handover to take place in <em>Bordeaux</em>. After the Respondent’s repeated emails from 30 June to 2 July on the issue, the Applicant eventually agreed to hand over the children in Bergerac. He agreed to do so only on 3 July – i.e., the day of her arrival in France. The Applicant’s initial indication for the handover to take place in Bordeaux and his late reply to the Respondent emails had caused her immense distress at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Later in the same trip, the Applicant had refused to pick up the children from her in Bergerac and insisted that she had to send them to him in Bordeaux.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     According to the Applicant,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Respondent’s interpretation of the June 2024 Order was erroneous. He also denied being unresponsive to her emails regarding the handover arrangement. According to him, his emails regarding the issue had been constructive, non-threatening, and showed that he had acted in the children’s best interests at all material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The issue is whether the Applicant had “created” or exploited the handover issue to harass the Respondent. In my view, the answer is no. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the correspondence shows that there had been a <em>bona fide difference in views</em> between the parties regarding what was the most practical handover arrangement during the 2024 summer holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Handover from the Applicant to the Respondent</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Respondent had wanted the Applicant to <em>personally pilot a chartered plane</em> to fly the children to Bergerac airport for the handover.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       On the other hand, the Applicant believed that what the Respondent had wanted him to do was unrealistic as it was contingent on several factors being met – i.e., that his license was valid, the weather allowed for it, the cost was low, and the air club had a plane to lend him for the trip. All these conditions could not be met at the material time. Instead, he felt that it was more feasible for the children to take a commercial flight to Bordeaux airport. This is because the Respondent was herself flying into that airport. The children and she could thus fly into Bordeaux airport, meet there, and then travel together by car to Bergerac. These explanations had been provided to the Respondent’s lawyers on 1 July and 3 July 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Clause 16 of the June 2024 Order states that the Applicant is to hand over the children to the Respondent for the summer school holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The order does not stipulate that the handover must take place in Bergerac. Given that the Respondent was going to arrive in Bordeaux airport (before driving to Bergerac), an argument can be made that a handover at Bordeaux airport (instead of Bergerac) is consistent with the June 2024 Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Handover from the Respondent to the Applicant</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       As for the Respondent’s insistence that the Applicant <em>pick up</em> the children from her in Bergerac later in the holiday, clause 16 does not stipulate that he must do so. She did not refer me to any other provision in the June 2024 Order to support her position that she was entitled to hand over the children in Bergerac. In the circumstances, it is reasonable for the Applicant to take the view that since the children were with the Respondent at the material time, it is for her to <em>hand over</em> to him the children. Under this view, the handover point should thus be Bordeaux since he was there at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, as a matter of principle, the Applicant cannot be said to commit “continual harassment” (as the term is defined in s 64 of the Charter) by <em>simply disagreeing</em> with the Respondent on the handover issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_i_9\"></a>(i)       To constitute such harassment, there must be something more – the Applicant must have (1) intentionally held a clearly unreasonable interpretation of the June 2024 Order or (2) acted unreasonably pursuant to his interpretation of the order. In such cases, the Applicant may be inferred to have disagreed with the Respondent intending or knowing that his unreasonable conduct is likely to cause anguish to her. A contrary view – that the Applicant commits “continual harassment” even if he has a reasonable basis for disagreeing with the Respondent and does so reasonably – is absurd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_ii_10\"></a>(ii)       In the present case, the Respondent has failed to prove that the Applicant’s disagreement over the handover issue was unreasonable and thus constituted “continual harassment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Removal of the Respondent’s belongings from the Home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Next, I turn to a highly contentious issue at the hearing. This concerns the removal of the Respondent’s belongings from the Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     By way of background, (a) the parties were staying in a black-and-white property at the material time, (b) the lease for this property was due to end on 15 August 2024, and (c) the Respondent had secured a place to stay from 16 August 2024 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     According to the Respondent, she had the right to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024. She relied on two pieces of evidence to support this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Clause 18 of the June 2024 Order states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff shall be allowed to remain in [the Home] with the said 3 children <em>until the expiry of the current lease</em> [on] 15 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 20 June 2024, the Applicant’s lawyers sent a letter to the Respondent’s lawyers (“<b>20 June Letter</b>”). Paragraph 3 of this letter states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Clause 18 of the Order provides that your client shall be allowed to remain in the [Home] with the Children until the expiry of the current lease on 15 August 2024. In view of DJ Lee’s Order, arrangements have been made for the [Home] to be returned to the landlord on 15 August 2024. ...<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Respondent alleged that despite the above, the Applicant had arranged for movers to pry open the lock on her bedroom door on or about 6 August 2024 and move her belongings into storage. The Applicant had done so knowing (a) that she was holidaying in France at the material time and (b) her objections to her belongings being moved. Furthermore, he did not promptly provide her with the key to the storage facility holding her belongings. According to the Respondent, the Applicant’s actions – which left her stranded with nowhere to stay upon her return to Singapore on 11 August 2024 – was calculated to cause her distress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Applicant submitted that it was not reasonable for the Respondent to assume that she could stay at the Home until 15 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she knew that the Home had to be reinstated <em>before</em> the lease expired on 15 August 2024. The parties had discussions about this on many occasions. In line with the need for reinstatement, the Applicant had in fact already packed most of her belongings into boxes by the time he left with the children for the June 2024 summer holiday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Applicant had sent the following two emails to the Respondent in July 2024 regarding the need for her to move out of the Home for the purpose of the reinstatement:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Email dated 18 July 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">... could you <em>please confirm</em> that you have <em>removed all your belongings from our [Home]</em>?

If I don’t hear from you <em>by July 22nd</em>, I will organize to clear the house. <em>Be assured that any items left will be stored securely, and I will provide you with access to them if required</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response to the above, the Respondent sent the following email to the Applicant on 23 July 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... you are now issuing me with UNILATERAL deadlines, demanding that I move the Children’s and my belongings. I do not agree to you moving my and the Children’s belongings at the [Home] and if you do, it will be in clear contravention of DJ Lee’s order that allows me and the Children to remain at [the Home] until 15 August 2024. You are in no way doing your part as of the orders of the court in order for me to facilitate the move. You knowing full well that I am currently away in France, unable to move my and the children’s things not just because of lack of funds but because of the obvious logistics of me being in France. I had tried to organise being set up well before my departure to Singapore and even had my lawyers send you multiple letters to do as the orders of the court 13th June 2024. However, as dated from your lawyers, it was specifically clear that you would not pay and that they even reiterated that I should stay in the [Home] until the end of the tenancy which is the 15th August. Your changing positions is not welcome and is intentioned to cause me unnecessary stress. Therefore, as per that order, that is what I am doing. Should you take my belongings before then or should I not be able to stay in the [Home] for any reason until that date, YOU WILL BE BREACHING THE ORDERS OF THE COURT GIVEN AS OF THE 13TH JUNE 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     According to the Applicant, he had no choice but to get the movers to put her belongings into storage in early August – so that the Home could be reinstated and handed back to the landlord by 15 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Regarding the storage facility key issue, the Applicant explained that he did not intend to cause the Respondent distress. The issue about the key had slipped his mind. He was still in France with the children at the material time. In any event, he had responded to the Respondent regarding the key issue on the same day when she queried him about it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I find that the Respondent knew, at all material times, that the Home had to be vacated <em>before</em> 15 August 2024 so that reinstatement works could be done. This finding is based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant had sent an email to the Respondent on 31 July 2024. In that email, he stated, among others, the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_i\"></a>(i)       That the Respondent was “fully aware” of the requirement for reinstatement to be done <em>before</em> the Home was to be surrendered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       That this requirement was stipulated in the Home’s lease agreement. (In my view, this assertion is inherently credible as the need for reinstatement is an important condition to a lease.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       That the lease agreement had already been sent to her lawyers on their request “during the interim applications proceedings”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The “interim application proceedings” in question would have been related to (i) the renewal of the Home’s lease agreement (7 July <em>2023</em>) and/or (ii) the <em>June 2024 Order</em> (13 June 2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, on 1 August 2024, the Respondent had provided a point-by-point rebuttal to various issues raised in the Applicant’s 31 July email. Glaringly, she did not deny the Applicant’s assertion summarised in [31(a)] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent’s knowledge about the need to vacate the Home before the lease expired is also evident from her police report filed on 12 August 2024. In that report, she had stated the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">My ex-husband and I have an interim maintenance and care of the children order from the 13<sup>th</sup> June 2024 ... stating that I am entitled to live in the marital home until the 15<sup>th</sup> August when the tenancy lease expires. <b><em>I had tried to move out immediately after the order was given prior to my departure to France on holiday</em></b>, but he informed my lawyers that he would not pay for my rental until the end of the current lease (15 August). ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Respondent had relied on clause 18 of the June 2024 Order to assert that she was entitled to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024 – the very last day of the lease. In my view, it is not entirely clear that clause 18 supports her position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Clause 18 can be interpreted in two ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       One interpretation (the one used by the Respondent) is to read clause 18 based on the emphasis in bold below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">The Plaintiff shall be <b>allowed to remain</b> in [the Home] with the said 3 children <b>until </b><em>the expiry of the current lease</em> [on] <b>15 August 2024</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The second interpretation gives emphasis to the text in italics above. It could reasonably be argued that by referring to the “current lease”, the clause had envisaged that the Respondent’s stay in the Home was subject to the conditions in that lease – which would include the requirement to reinstate the Home. Under this interpretation, the date “15 August 2024” in clause 18 is merely a reference to the expiry date of the Home’s lease and does not stipulate the last day that the Respondent could stay at the Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The ambiguity in clause 18 could have been avoided through better drafting. For instance, if DJ Lee had intended for the Respondent to be allowed to stay at the Home until 15 August 2024, then the text “the expiry of the current lease” should have been omitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There is no evidence to show whether DJ Lee had been alerted by the parties to (i) the ambiguity in clause 18 and (ii) the need to factor in sufficient time for the Home to be reinstated before its surrender on 15 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If DJ Lee had been alerted to these matters, I seriously doubt that she would make the order in clause 18. This is because it is plainly unreasonable for the Respondent to be allowed to stay in the Home until the very last day of its lease given that the reinstatement works would take time – especially when the Home is a black-and-white house and the parties had stayed there for more than 10 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Respondent had also relied on the 20 June Letter to support her entitlement to stay in the Home until 15 August 2024. According to her, the letter gave her this impression. It is unclear how the Respondent could have come to such an impression. I say this because the letter <em>clearly</em> states that – “In view of DJ Lee’s Order, arrangements have been made for the [Home] <em>to be returned to the landlord on 15 August 2024</em>” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     To sum up –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent had failed to prove her case that the Applicant had created the situation regarding the removal of her belongings from the Home to harass her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I accept the Applicant’s evidence that he had no choice but to get the movers to put her belongings into storage in early August – so that the Home could be reinstated and handed back to the landlord by 15 August 2024: see [29] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I also accept the Applicant’s evidence regarding the storage facility key issue: see [30] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged harassment in the Applicant’s communications</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s allegation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I now move to the Respondent’s final allegation. According to her, the Applicant had continued to be “harassing, constantly bullying, and threatening in his communication with [her]” after the PPO was issued.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Applicant denied the Respondent’s allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s allegation against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Respondent had failed to substantiate her bare allegation. There would not have been any difficulty for her to adduce evidence of the Applicant’s alleged threats/harassment. This is because based on her evidence, (i) the threats/harassment were in the form of messages/emails which can easily be produced in court, and (ii) there were several such communications. Given these circumstances, the Respondent’s failure to adduce the relevant threatening/harassing communications casts doubt on veracity of her allegation against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent’s allegation that the Applicant was someone who would send threatening/harassing communications does not gel with his emails that have been tendered in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> I find the tone and content in these emails to be restrained and civil. This is so even when the Respondent had levelled harsh accusations against him in her emails.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Dog Air-Tag</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I note that during cross-examination, the Respondent had testified to being fearful of being placed under surveillance by the Applicant. She alleged that she had found an Air-Tag in her home with the name of his dog, “A” (“<b>Dog’s Air-Tag</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I did not place any weight on this allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the allegation was made belatedly – (i) it was not “put” to the Applicant, (ii) it did not appear in the Respondent’s affidavit or examination-in-chief, and (iii) it was raised for the first time only during the tail end of her evidence under cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent did not provide any evidence to show that the Applicant had planted the Dog’s Air-Tag to track/harass <em>her</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, when pressed on whether she was making any accusation against the Applicant regarding the Dog’s Air-Tag, the Respondent clarified that (i) she was merely stating that the Air-Tag was found in her home, and (ii) she did not know whether the Dog’s Air-Tag was even working. No reference was made to the issue of the Dog’s Air-Tag in her closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To sum-up, the Respondent had failed to prove her allegation that the Applicant had continued to harass her after PPO xx4 was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Is the Applicant likely to commit family violence in future</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I will now consider whether the Applicant is likely to commit family violence against the Respondent in future: see [5(b)(iv)] and [5(c)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In this regard, I note that when DJ Lee issued PPO xx4, she had considered that the parties were likely to meet each other because of access and other arrangements regarding their children: see [7(b)] above. Presumably, DJ Lee was concerned that such contacts could become flashpoints for the Applicant to harass the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In this regard, the Applicant submitted that he is unlikely to commit such family violence in future. He highlighted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, when PPO xx4 was imposed in February 2023, the parties were still married and living together. There has been a material change in circumstances since then. Specifically, the parties (i) have obtained interim judgement for divorce (in May 2023), (ii) have been living in different premises (since August 2024), and (iii) have minimal interactions with each other. Their communications are now conducted through emails or letters between their respective lawyers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the handovers of the children at the Respondent’s condominium (i) have been taking place regularly without the need for parties to meet each other and (ii) have been incident-free. As the children grow older, they can travel to the parties’ place of residence by themselves.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     According to the Respondent, the PPO is still necessary.

Such a submission shows that he lacked (i) awareness of the effect of his conduct on her and (ii) remorse.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent is fearful that the Applicant may physically hurt her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my view, it is unlikely that the Applicant will harass the Respondent in future. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46      <em>First</em>, I accept the Applicant’s submissions at [43(a)] above that there has been a material change in circumstances since the PPO was imposed. These changes make it unlikely for him to want to place her under surveillance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Reason for PPO.</em> PPO xx4 was issued on the <em>sole basis</em> that the Applicant had, without the Respondent’s consent, installed CCTV cameras in the Home (in February 2022) and Air-Tags in the Respondent’s car (in April 2022). DJ Lee found that the installation of these devices had caused her distress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Reasons for installing surveillance devices.</em> According to the Applicant, he had installed the surveillance devices to prevent the Respondent from (i) falsely accusing him of having committed family violence at the Home, and (ii) disposing the matrimonial assets kept there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>No more motive.</em> At the time of this judgement, the parties have been leading separate lives for some time. They no longer share a common communal space. As such, (i) the Applicant’s reasons for placing the Respondent under surveillance in the first place no longer exist, and (ii) the opportunities for him to harass her – e.g., by intruding into her private space – is practically zero.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47      <em>Second</em>, the evidence shows (fortunately) that the children’s care and other arrangements have not become a source of conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Physical contact is rare.</em> Since the parties started living apart, they have seldom come into physical contact with each other because of the children. It is undisputed that children’s handover can – and has – taken place without the Applicant having to engage the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Interactions have been incident-free.</em> On the occasions where the parties had been in physical contact, e.g., handing over of the children’s passports and helping to load/unload the luggage into the Applicant’s car for the children’s holidays,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> there is no evidence that the Applicant had harassed the Respondent. In coming to this view, I am mindful that there was an incident with the children’s handover during the 2024 summer holiday. In my view, that incident was neither created nor exploited by the Applicant for the purpose of harassing the Respondent: see [22] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Occasions for disagreement have been reduced by court orders.</em> The occasions for disagreements between the parties are likely to be reduced moving forward. I say this because after the PPO was imposed, various interim orders had been issued (in June 2024) that clarified the parties’ rights and obligations relating to the children’s care and control arrangements, as well as their maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Applicant can act rationally when dealing with children’s issues.</em> Where they were disagreements over the children’s issues, the Applicant had chosen to engage with the Respondent on these issues squarely – instead of resorting to threats and harassment to resolve them: see [37(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     At this juncture, I wish to address three matters raised by the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Ongoing legal proceedings.</em> Contrary to her submission, I am not persuaded that PPO xx4 is still necessary just because there are ongoing legal proceedings between the parties. The Respondent has failed to show why this fact alone justifies the continuation of the PPO. I note that the parties have been embroiled in legal proceedings since 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> There is no evidence to show, e.g., that the Applicant had initiated or used these proceedings to harass the Respondent, or that such proceedings make him more prone to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Whether Applicant lacks insight into the effects of his conduct on the Respondent.</em> Additionally, I disagree with the Respondent’s contention regarding the Relevant Submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It bears highlighting that the Applicant had made the Relevant Submission in the context of <em>two strongly contested issues</em> – i.e., whether he had harassed the Respondent, (1) during the handover of the children during the 2024 summer holiday, and (2) by removing her belongings from the Home without her consent In August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Applicant had made the Relevant Submission to persuade me to decide on the two disputed matters based on the facts – instead of stereotypical thinking that women are victims and men are abusers. In my view, the Applicant should be given some latitude to decide how best to frame his case for the two disputed matters. Otherwise, his ability to effectively present his case and discredit the Respondent’s case will be severely curtailed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Whether Applicant will be physically violent towards the Respondent.</em> Contrary to the Respondent’s submission, I find it unlikely that the Applicant will physically hurt her if the PPO is revoked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Respondent submission that he will hurt her is based on an “assumption”. According to the Respondent, she had formed this assumption because he did not attend the children’s parent-teacher meetings. She reasoned that he had been absent because he was afraid that he might not be able to control himself and might begin to hurt her if he were to see her at such meetings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I find the Respondent’s assumption to be highly fanciful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       There is no evidence to show that the Applicant has a propensity for using physical violence against the Respondent. It is an undisputed fact that <em>even before PPO xx4 was imposed</em>, she did not put a lock on the inside of her bedroom to prevent him from entering her bedroom.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Respondent would not have been so blasé about not installing such a lock if the Applicant is prone to using physical violence and she is fearful of him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       I find that the Respondent is a woman who is not afraid to assert her rights and to take appropriate measures to protect her personal safety and interests. This is evident from the fact that she (1) had applied for PPO against the Applicant (in 2022),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> (2) had filed police reports against him (in 2022 and 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> (3) had recorded the Applicant’s actions when she felt threatened during the time they were staying together, and (4) had no hesitation in using harsh language in her emails to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The Applicant will know that if he were to commit family violence against her, she will not hesitate to place the full weight of the law on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49      <em>Finally</em>, having observed the Applicant testify in court, I sense that he has decided to move on with his life. I do not get the impression that he harbours deep animosity towards the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I find that PPO xx4 is no longer necessary to deter the Applicant from committing family violence against the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my view, the revocation of PPO xx4 is in line with the parties’ wish for co-parenting to play a larger role in their children’s lives. This wish is evident, for instance, from the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A few months before the hearing, the Respondent had decided to personally hand over the daughter’s passport to the Applicant at the airport. According to the Respondent, she had wanted to demonstrate to the children that she could work together with the Applicant as co-parents, and that she was not afraid of him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Applicant, he wants PPO xx4 to be revoked because it sends a strong negative signal that he is likely to commit family violence, and that such a signal hampers his efforts to normalise his relationship with his children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Accordingly, I revoke the PPO with immediate effect.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 13 September 2024 at [11]; Oral submissions on 14 March 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The reasons appear in the Records of Proceedings for SS xx2/2023 on 3 February 2023 (Day 7) from page 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See the Records of Proceedings for SS xx2/2023 on 3 February 2023 (Day 7) at pages 36 and 37; Respondent’s complaint (SSA xxx1/2022) dated 29 April 2022.

The group had set ablaze the door and rug of an apartment and had written “O$P$” in indelible ink on an adjacent wall. And the group had done so in response to a job offer on a social media platform that promised payment of $2,000 upon the completion of these tasks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The youth pleaded guilty to the offence in the Youth Court, which called for a probation suitability report to assist it in its formulation of dispositional orders in respect of the youth. While that report was prepared, bail was granted to the youth on conditions that included: (a) a prohibition on him meeting his accomplices; and (b) a requirement for him to continue attend school (collectively, the “Bail Conditions”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Ms Haidah Sharin, a probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, prepared the probation suitability report. Therein, she assessed the youth to have a “High” risk of re-offending due to his propensity for taking risks, his anti-social attitudes (save for his continued association with negative peers), and his unwillingness to improve his lifestyle. She noted that the parents of the youth employed “permissive” parenting that facilitated an “unrestrained lifestyle” without “guidance, intervention and structure”. She thus concluded that the youth was ill-suited for such community-based rehabilitation as probation and recommended that the youth be placed in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (a “JRC”) for 21 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The prosecution endorsed these recommendations, especially the proposal in the probation suitability report that the youth should embark upon a rehabilitation program at the JRC that comprised three sequential stages. The first stage of 3 months would introduce discipline and structure in his lifestyle. The next stage of 12 months would build his capacity for change and strengthen his support networks. The last stage of 6 months would re-integrate him into the community.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The youth and his parents submitted that he should nevertheless be placed on probation. The youth explained that he desired to reside with his family and promised to submit to electronic monitoring to secure his compliance with the terms of his probation. The parents of the youth aligned themselves with this position and promised to cooperate with the probation officer and to inform the authorities should the youth commit any further offences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       All the parties concurred that rehabilitation was the predominant consideration in these proceedings and was in the best interests of the youth, whose welfare was my paramount concern (see s 4(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”). I agreed. The offence, although serious, was not grave. The harm caused was limited to a charred door and rug. The youth was only 13 years of age. The focus on his rehabilitation was justified given the characteristically impulsive nature of his adolescent decision-making. Further, society had a keen interest in his reform given the many years that he had ahead of him. Hence, what remained was for me to decide whether that rehabilitation would be realised better by placing him on probation or in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As VK Rajah JA observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')\">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“<em>Al-Ansari</em>”) at [55], a probation order is a community-based dispositional order. Even as a probation order “seeks to protect society through the supervision to which the offender is required to submit, it both minimises the restrictions placed upon him and offers him the help of society in adjusting his conduct to its demands.” It “seeks to strengthen the offender’s resources so that he may become a more responsible member of the community, which must also play a part in rehabilitating him.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Two conditions must exist for a probation order to be viable. First, the personal characteristics of the offender must render him amenable to community-based rehabilitation (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> (“<em>Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em>”) at [57]). Specifically, he must accept responsibility for his actions, desire to change for the better, and possess the self-discipline to bring that desire to fruition. Second, the offender must have adequate family support and supervision because probationary supervision takes place substantially in the natural setting of the offender and not in a closed institution. The probation officer is “never going to be able to supervise the offender closely on a day-to-day basis” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> at [24]). It is thus incumbent on the family of the offender to ensure that he remains on the straight and narrow. In the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> at [12], “a disciplined home is essential”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I agreed with the prosecution that the structured environment of the JRC would best secure the rehabilitation of the youth. First, the youth was prone to impulsive decision-making and risk-taking, as evidenced in his admission that he had committed the offence for “fast cash” and without regard to the potential occupants in the apartment. Second, although he expressed remorse for his actions, he showed limited commitment to reform. He maintained contact with one accomplice, even as he claimed that it was pressure from his accomplices that had caused him to offend, and even as doing so was a breach of his Bail Conditions. Third, he neglected to continue to attend school, which would have provided him constructive routine, even as such neglect was a further breach of his Bail Conditions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parents of the youth demonstrated little ability to supervise him. First, they were blasé about his offending: they expressed helplessness about it and minimised his role therein by attributing his actions to pressure from his accomplices. Second, they failed to enforce the Bail Conditions even at risk of forfeiture of the bail that they had furnished on his behalf. Third, their proposed plans to supervise him lacked substance and were limited to reminding him orally to avoid criminality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Ultimately, the youth and his parents evinced an indifference to his rehabilitation that rendered impracticable his rehabilitation in the community. The events that followed his plea of guilt and his release into the community on bail were telling. The probation officer scheduled two interviews with the youth to assess his suitability for probation: on 20 and 21 March 2025. But he attended neither interview. He missed the first interview in favour of a meal with one of his accomplices. He missed the second interview and offered no explanation for that absence. In scheduling those interviews, the probation officer had acceded to a request by his parents to avoid the dates of a camp organised by his school. Yet he did not attend that school camp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Separately, the probation officer contacted the parents of the youth to schedule interviews to discuss their supervision of him were he to be placed on probation. But no agreement was reached on a time for these interviews.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 28 March 2025, the probation officer applied to adjourn these proceedings “to 22 April 2025 or later” due to “the youth’s defaulting interview sessions and difficulty in scheduling interviews.” She explained that further engagement with the youth and his parents would “ensure a holistic and thorough probation suitability report”. In response to this request, the prosecution observed: “attempts were made to interview the youth and his family but the latter chose not to turn up and displayed no interest for the welfare/wellbeing of the youth”. The prosecution added that any adjournment should be the “final” one and that “this case shall move on for the youth to receive early rehab programme (if need be).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I fixed the disposition of these proceedings on 15 April 2025 and directed the probation officer to complete the probation suitability report by that date. It was incumbent on the youth and his family, who desired to have him rehabilitated in the community, to work with the probation officer on her assessment of the viability of such rehabilitation. Yet, neither the youth nor his parents had made the effort to meet punctually with the probation officer. Although further engagements with them could conduce to a “holistic and thorough probation suitability report”, their nonchalance towards the assessment of the youth’s suitability for community-based rehabilitation was itself sufficiently probative that probation would be unworkable for the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The parents of the youth explained that their work commitments had hampered them from bringing the youth for his interviews with the probation officer. I accepted their explanation and had no doubt that they were diligently providing for their household. But the issue here was their supervision of the youth in the community. Given that their work commitments would persist even after the conclusion of these proceedings, they would continue to struggle to supervise the youth on a probation order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The probation officer nevertheless indulged the youth and his parents with a further interview on 1 April 2025. But at the appointed time on that day, they were nowhere to be found. Only an hour-and-a-half later did they arrive at the interview venue. Due to this delay, the interview could not take place. When asked about the reasons for this delay, they claimed first that they had boarded the wrong bus then and then that they had alighted at the wrong bus stop. But these claims were inconsistent if not fanciful, further demonstrated their nonchalance towards his rehabilitation, and inspired little confidence that probation would work for the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Under a probation order, an offender is “conditionally entrusted with freedom so that he may learn the social duties it involves” (see <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [55]). But the youth had the discipline of neither himself nor of his home environment to be entrusted with such freedom. The only option that would work for his rehabilitation was the closed and structured environment of the JRC. Given the sustained dearth of discipline in his life, I agreed with the prosecution and the probation officer that a 21-month placement at the JRC that entailed three stages of rehabilitation (see [4] above) was in his best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The parents of the youth argued that a probation order with conditions for hostel residence and electronic monitoring could secure similar supervision of the youth. But this argument reinforced the case for his institutionalisation by recognising that he needed a structured environment with rigorous supervision for his rehabilitation. The self-contained environment of the JRC with its on-site educational facilities and day-to-day supervision would better procure this rehabilitation than the open environment of a hostel, the residents of which must head into the community for their education. To his credit, the youth conceded that he was “uncertain whether hostel residence would help to improve his school attendance and felt worried that he would not be able to adjust to the environment and daily schedule in hostel.” Hence, a probation order, even if coupled with hostel residence and electronic monitoring, would not be in his best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even if a probation order with hostel residence, electronic monitoring, and a suite of supplementary conditions could <em>theoretically</em> approximate the structure and supervision of a JRC placement, a JRC placement would remain the more appropriate order to make. The JRC has been established by the State as the scheme for youth offenders who need institutionalised structure and supervision. The Youth Court should be slow to duplicate this established scheme through improvised probation arrangements. I excerpt the observations of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> in placing an offender on reformative training instead of on probation with residence at a private hostel (at [64]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In my judgment, where a statutory scheme of institutional confinement has been devised by the state and placed at the sentencing disposal of the courts, the court should not ordinarily subvert this by devising alternative schemes that impose terms of probation conditioned on residence in private homes. The courts do not have either the means or the tools, nor for that matter is it our place, to second-guess legislatively crafted sentencing options which have been thought through, deliberated on and developed by policy-makers. Nor, as I observed in the course of oral arguments, should the courts place the offender in the position where he is able to simply pick and choose the terms on which he would like to be rehabilitated. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I thus ordered the youth to reside in the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for 21 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I record my appreciation to Ms Morene Sim and Mr Muhammad Dzulkifly, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court for these proceedings (pursuant to s 38 of the CYPA), for their service and their advice in formulating these dispositional orders.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs","Family Law – Costs – Assessing the quantum of costs payable to a successful self-represented person"],"date":"2025-04-08","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2524 of 2014 (Summons No 2478 and 2743 of 2024)","title":"TPL v TPM","citation":"[2025] SGFC 46","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33190-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband, in person and unrepresented","Kalvinder Kaur D/O Ranjit Singh and Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-05-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>TPL v TPM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> TPL <em>v</em> TPM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33190-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 46</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2524 of 2014 (Summons No 2478 and 2743 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">08 April 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband, in person and unrepresented; Kalvinder Kaur D/O Ranjit Singh and Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> TPL — TPM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Assessing the quantum of costs payable to a successful self-represented person</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">8 April 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my judgment on costs in respect of SUM 2478 and 2743 of 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The divorce between parties had concluded in 2016. Parties returned to court when, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of June 2024, the Wife took out an application <em>vide</em> SUM 1993/2024 (“SUM 1993”) to vary the orders made in respect of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As SUM 1993 wound its way through to a hearing, the Husband took out two applications for discovery and interrogatories in SUMs 2478 and 2743. I heard both applications and granted orders in respect of the Husband’s application. The only outstanding matter left for me to decide was that of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband submits that he should be entitled to costs. In formulating his position on costs, he argues that the court should take into account the fact that he is a practising lawyer. The Husband says that it is only fair to do so to ensure that he is compensated for reasonable costs incurred in the litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In that vein, the Husband provides two bases upon which he has calculated the costs he says he should be entitled to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Basis “A”:</b> a discounted rate of $725 per hour. The discount applied reflects the discount that the Husband normally applies to his fees, and a further 30% discount to reflect the fact that he is not a Singapore qualified lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Husband says he has spent a total of 114.9 hours on both summonses. On this basis, the quantum of costs the Husband says he is entitled to comes up to $83,302.50.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Basis “B”:</b> a discounted rate of S$330 per hour. According to the Husband, this rate takes into account the “actual cost” of participating in this litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband has, in deriving this figure, computed the impact these proceedings has had on his billings. He says that he has spent a total of 114.9 hours on both summonses. The quantum of costs which the Husband says he is entitled to thus comes up to $37,917.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, took the position that there should be no order as to costs. The following reasons were given. First, that it would be prudent to avoid aggravating acrimony between the parties. In support of this argument, counsel not only cited the decision in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), but also pointed to the Husband’s conduct of the litigation where he had also taken out numerous other proceedings against the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Second, that although the Husband is a lawyer, he is still effectively a litigant in person (or self-represented person). According to counsel, this justifies making no order as to costs because, as the court in <em>WSH v WSI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30753-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 40</a> had noted, costs are usually only provided when parties had legal representation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Finally, counsel for the Wife also argued, in the alternative, that if I was minded to order costs in the Husband’s favour, the quantum of such costs should be fixed at $800. This reflects the fact that the Husband had not incurred filing fees in respect of the documents he had submitted. Counsel also cited the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Arokiasamy Steven Joseph (administrator of the estate of Salvin Foster Steven, deceased) and another v Lee Boon Chuan Nelson and others and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30422-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 291</a> (“<em>Arokiasamy</em>”) for the proposition that where litigants-in-person are awarded costs, the costs awarded are “much lower than what would have been awarded as party-and-party costs where the litigant is represented by solicitors”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The starting point when it comes to costs in family proceedings is that costs shall follow the event. Given that the Husband had succeeded in both SUMs 2478 and 2743, in that he had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items pursued in discovery and interrogatories, he is entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Although counsel for the Wife has argued that I should depart from this starting point to minimise acrimony between the parties, I find no basis to do so in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For one, although counsel for the Wife had stated that the acrimony between parties had “caused problems relating to their co-parenting of the children”, this was a bare assertion in their submissions made without references to any evidence contained in the affidavits that had been filed (see <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31690-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 43</a> at [8]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Wife did draw my attention to the various summonses filed by the Husband as evidence of the acrimony between the parties. That said, the mere fact of multiple applications being taken out by one party is not <em>necessarily</em> an indication of deep-seated acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This brings me to the next point – that is the quantum of costs which the Husband is entitled to. The starting point, when it comes to awarding costs to a self-represented person, is Rule 870 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) – that provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Compensatory costs for litigants in person</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">870.  On a taxation of the costs of a litigant in person, such costs as would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred may be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Rule 870 has been interpreted as affording the court the discretion to “allow costs for a litigant in person that would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred” (<em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [81]; see also <em>WXI v WXJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31581-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 31</a> at [66]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this connection, the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney General and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29416-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 52</a> (“<em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>”) provides an example of how the court might assess costs that a self-represented person is entitled. In awarding the self-represented person (“Mah”) costs, the court applied O 59 r 18A of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> which is essentially <em>in pari materia</em> with Rule 870 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In its assessment of the quantum of costs that would reasonably compensate Mah for the time he had spent, the court considered two points. First, how much time did Mah spend on the litigation? Second, to fix an hourly rate that would compensate him for that time spent: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As to the amount of time Mah had spent, the court was of the view that there was no need to produce time sheets – the court was able to use its “own experience of litigation” to estimate the reasonable time spent. In that connection, the court noted that there must be an “objective yardstick of reasonableness” in assessing the amount of time spent: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As to the applicable hourly rate, the court arrived at a figure of $66.66 which was rounded down to $60.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In arriving at this hourly rate, the court took, as its starting point, the scale of costs applicable in the Magistrate’s Court – a typical case involving 2 to 3 days of trial and 3 to 4 days of pre and post-trial work would encompass some 50 hours of work on the part of the lawyer. Costs for such a case would come in at $5,000, and this would result in an hourly rate of $100. To eliminate the profit margin that a lawyer would be entitled to, but not a self-represented person, the court discounted the $100 hourly rate by a third: <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19      <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>, however, did not involve a situation where the self-represented person was a practising lawyer who had full conduct of their own case. In this connection, the Husband relies on the case of <em>London Scottish Benefit Society v Chorley</em> [1884] 13 QBD 872 (“<em>Chorley</em>”) for the proposition that he should be entitled to recover “his professional costs” for the legal work he had done on his own case. The Husband also cites the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in <em>Lam Hwa Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v Yang Qiang</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0003.xml')\">[2014] SGCA 3</a> (“<em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>”) which he says implicitly recognises the principle in <em>Chorley</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20      <em>Chorley</em> was a case where the defendants were lawyers who had acted in person. They won, and so, were entitled to costs. The question was whether they were entitled to costs that any other defendant in person was entitled to, or whether they were entitled to costs that a successful defendant who had employed a lawyer could claim (excluding costs for matters such as taking instructions). The plaintiffs objected when the defendants presented their bill of taxation to the master – they argued that that the defendants only ought to be entitled to costs that any other defendant in person was entitled to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The master overruled the objection. A summons to review the master’s taxation was taken out and subsequently dismissed (see <em>London Scottish Benefit Society v Chorley</em> [1884] 12 QBD 452). The case went on to the Court of Appeal where Brett MR, Bowen LJ and Fry LJ dismissed the appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     This was the proposition laid down in <em>Chorley</em>: that a lawyer who acted in person was entitled to the same costs as a litigant who had engaged counsel to act for them, save for those items of costs that are rendered unnecessary (<em>ie</em>, the “costs of instructions and attendances”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The rationale underlying this proposition was to avoid a situation where a lawyer, who was involved in their own personal litigation before the courts, could recover full costs by simply engaging another lawyer to act for them in their own case. As Brett MR noted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It was contended for the plaintiffs that there is no difference as regards the right to costs between a solicitor and an ordinary person; and for the defendants it was contended that the costs of a solicitor, who is party to a suit, ought substantially to be taxed as if he had been acting for a different person. I think neither contention correct. I cannot think that any privilege of a solicitor exists. I am wholly unable to agree to any argument standing upon that footing. I should have thought that a person wrongfully brought into litigation ought to be indemnified against the expenses to which he is unjustly put; but there cannot be a perfect indemnity, because it is impossible to determine how much of the costs is incurred through his own over-anxiety. When an ordinary party to a suit appears for himself, he is not indemnified for loss of time; but when he appears by solicitor, he is entitled to recover for the time expended by the solicitor in the conduct of the suit. When an ordinary litigant appears in person, he is paid only for costs out of pocket. He cannot himself take every step, and very often employs a solicitor to assist him: the remuneration to the solicitor is money paid out of pocket. He has to pay the fees of the court, that is money paid out of pocket; but for loss of time the law will not indemnify him. When, however, we come to the case of a solicitor, the question must be viewed from a different aspect. <b>There are things which a solicitor can do for himself, but also he can employ another solicitor to do them for him; and it would be unadvisable to lay down that he shall not be entitled to ordinary costs if he appears in person, because in that case he would always employ another solicitor.</b> If a solicitor does by his clerk that which might be done by another solicitor, it is a loss of money, and not simply a loss of time, because it is work done by a person who is paid for doing it. It is true, however, to say that the costs of a solicitor appearing in person must be taxed differently from those of an ordinary litigant appearing by a solicitor. The unsuccessful adversary of a solicitor appearing in person cannot be charged for what does not exist, he cannot be charged for the solicitor consulting himself, or instructing himself, or attending upon himself. The true rule seems to be that when a solicitor brings or defends an action in person, he is entitled to the same costs as an ordinary litigant appearing by a solicitor, subject to this restriction, that no costs which are really unnecessary can be recovered. Of this kind are the costs of instructions and attendances. None of the text-books have laid down a different rule from that which I have enunciated, and a uniform practice has not prevailed amongst the masters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Fry LJ made a similar observation:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I think that the conclusion at which we have arrived will be beneficial to the public, <b>because if the rule were otherwise a solicitor who is party to an action would always employ another solicitor, and whenever he is successful he would recover full costs</b>; whereas under the rule of practice laid down by us, a solicitor who sues or defends in person will be entitled, if he is successful, to full costs, subject to certain deductions, of which his unsuccessful opponent will get the benefit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband’s reliance on <em>Chorley</em> does not support his claim for costs on either basis that he has computed (above at [5]). It is clear from the speeches of Brett MR and Fry LJ that one concern was to avoid a situation where a lawyer, who had their own personal litigation before the courts, could claim full costs by simply engaging another counsel to act for them. The practical way of dealing with this was to allow such litigants to claim full costs, but to discount items that had been rendered unnecessary – such as the time expended in taking instructions from a client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even if one applies the rule in <em>Chorley</em>, the Husband would only be entitled to the same costs that he would have recovered, had he engaged a family lawyer to act for him, less any costs rendered unnecessary by the fact that he had acted in person. What this means, in practical terms, is that if the court would have awarded costs of $1,000 to a litigant who was represented in respect of an application for discovery and interrogatories, a quantum <b><em>lower</em></b> than $1000 should be awarded if the litigant were a lawyer who had chosen to represent themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to the Husband’s point, that the Singapore Court of Appeal had, in <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>, implicitly approved “the notion of a self-represented lawyer recovering his costs”, I do not share the same reading of that judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em>, the respondent had sought to claim, as disbursements, travel expenses which came up to $1,208. The appellant objected to this claim. Their objections, however, found little weight with the taxing registrar, and the District Judge, and the High Court. The case eventually wound its way to the Court of Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Before the Court of Appeal, the appellant cited the decision in <em>Chorley</em>, claiming that it laid down a “general principle of law precluding the recovery of a successful litigant’s travel expenses”: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, noting that the costs regime was governed by a legislative provision which reflected the prevailing policy considerations and societal conditions, and so the decision in <em>Chorley</em>, which was of some vintage, had little bearing on the issue of whether travel expenses could be reasonably claimed as disbursements: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [24]. In any event, a close reading of <em>Chorley</em> revealed that there was a transcribing error – the word “travel” which appears in that judgment was “probably in fact meant to mean trouble” – and so <em>Chorley</em> could not support the proposition that the appellant had contended for: <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> at [25] – [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There is nothing in the passages of <em>Lam Hwa Engineering</em> which suggest that the Court of Appeal had implicitly endorsed the proposition in <em>Chorley</em>. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal had noted (at [29]) that little weight could be given to precedent from other jurisdictions unless it had been established that the costs framework applicable were <em>in pari materia</em> with our own framework. On that note, I also observe that the principle in <em>Chorley</em> is not a universally accepted one: see the decision of the High Court of Australia in <em>Bell Lawyers Pty Ltd v Pentelow and Another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/cth/HCA/2019/29.html')\">[2019] HCA 29</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, as I have noted above, Rule 870 of the FJR governs the determination of costs, and the General Division of the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> had, in interpreting O 59 r 18A of the ROC 2014 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> with Rule 870 of the FJR 2014), laid down a framework to assess what constitutes reasonable costs. The question was whether this framework in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> should be applied (with or without any modifications) to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Both the Husband, as well as counsel for the Wife were invited to address me, in further written submissions, on this specific point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Counsel for the Wife reiterated their position, that no order as to costs should be made. They also distinguish <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> on the basis that the case was a relatively “complex tort matter concerning wrongful apprehension, false imprisonment and assault and battery, heard in the High Court” whereas both SUMs 2478 and 2743 were merely interlocutory applications heard in the Family Courts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This is, in my view, a distinction without merit – the real issue, which was not addressed, was whether the <em>methodology</em> for assessing costs payable to a self-represented person that had been used in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> was applicable, or could be adapted to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In addition, counsel for the Wife also pointed me to a set of proceedings in the High Court involving the same parties (<em>ie</em>, the Husband and the Wife). The Husband had taken out a discovery application, and prevailed. The Assistant Registrar had fixed costs at $500, despite having claimed $100,000 based on his hourly rate as a solicitor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband had filed an appeal which was dismissed by the High Court. Counsel for the Wife pointed out that the Husband had relied on <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in support of his arguments that he should be entitled to compensate him for the time expended by him on the matter, and that the court should fix an amount to compensate him for that time. The Husband’s appeal was wholly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Insofar as counsel for the Wife had referred to this set of proceedings in the High Court involving both the Husband and the Wife, they had not placed before me, or cited, the reasons as to why the High Court had declined to apply <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in its assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband, on the other hand, takes the position that if one applies the various propositions drawn from <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> to the present case, I should take into account “non-monetary relief and considerations”. As to the considerations that should be accounted for, the Husband urges me to consider factors such as the Wife’s conduct, namely her alleged attempts to exclude him from the sale of their four jointly-owned properties, and the monthly sums that she is claiming in respect of maintenance for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband, however, argued that the “putative restriction” on costs in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> (referring to the 1/3 discount applied to reflect the profit margin that a lawyer is entitled to, but not a self-represented person (see above at [18]) should not apply. He cited the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Arokiasamy</em> at [10] for the proposition that because he had “outperformed [counsel for the Wife] by a significant margin”, it would be “manifestly unjust” to limit his costs to “two thirds of what [a] fumbling counsel” would get.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In <em>Arokiasamy</em>, the court had to deal with the assessment of costs payable to a successful self-represented person. The court observed (at [8] – [11]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8    The claim for costs by the plaintiffs is less straightforward. Traditionally costs were not given to litigants-in-person because such costs are party-and-party costs and awarded to help a litigant defray his solicitor-and-client costs. <b>In modern times, the Rules of Court allow costs to be awarded even to litigants-in-person. In the rare cases where such costs had been awarded, they are much lower than what would have been awarded as party-and-party costs where the litigant is represented by solicitors or counsel.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9    The Civil Procedure Rules in the UK capped costs to litigants-in-person to two thirds of what would have been ordered had the litigant been represented by a lawyer. This appears to have been the formula adopted by the High Court in <em>Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney-General and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29416-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 52</a> at [7]-[9]. I have no disagreement with the decision of Jeyaretnam J in that case, save to say that <b>it is not appropriate to lay down strict formulae for costs for litigants-in-person for reasons that I shall now elaborate.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    Unlike the Civil Procedure Rules in the UK which provide for capped costs to litigants-in-person, our Rules of Court 2014 (O 59 r 18A) and Rules of Court 2021 (O 21 r 7) do not provide for any cap on quantum. As such, I am of the view that the two thirds cap found in the UK Civil Procedure Rules is, at best, a useful guide. <b>The quantum of costs is always discretionary (as opposed to the principles regarding when costs may be awarded). That is because costs are fact sensitive, and every case is different.</b> When litigants appear in person, matters can get even more complicated because an anxious litigant may labour excessively, often misguiding himself for lack of knowledge of the law. In other cases, the litigant may indeed have knowledge of the law and labour as hard with better results. Conversely, a litigant-in-person may outperform counsel in the case, making it appear manifestly unjust that he should be limited to two thirds of what the fumbling counsel gets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    The point therefore, is that <b>costs of a litigant-in-person should not be taxed separately, but fixed by the trial judge because he is the person who knows the facts and merits required to adjust the discretionary quantification of costs to a litigant-in-person</b>. That court will be guided by the fact that <b>money is rarely adequate compensation even in successful litigation. Neither are costs meant as a punishment to the party who has failed.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is worth noting that the court in <em>Arokiasamy</em> did not follow the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>. In fixing costs at $500, the court took into account the fact that both plaintiffs had to attend court on two or three occasions and that they had produced evidence on affidavit that had assisted the court. Given that neither plaintiff was employed, there was no loss of income to claim as disbursements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the present case, I would decline to follow the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> for two reasons. First, in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>, the court’s starting point, when it came to assessing the hourly rate that a self-represented person was entitled to, was the scale of costs included in Part IV of Appendix 2 to ROC 2014 which provided that in cases before the Magistrate’s Court, where a plaintiff was awarded $20,000, the range of costs to be awarded was $3,000 – $6,000 (excluding disbursements).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     If one looks at the FJR 2014, a set of fixed costs is also provided for certain cases (<em>ie</em>, where summary judgment is obtained) under Part 2 to the Third Schedule of the FJR 2014. These figures are identical to those found in Part 2 of Appendix 2 of the ROC 2014, except that the scale is for the District Court, whereas the figures provided for the same proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court are approximately 1.5 times lower.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     While it may be tempting to apply a multiplier of 1.5 to the hourly rate of $60 in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em> in order to fix an hourly rate, I would decline to do so. That is because the figures given in Part 2 to the Third Schedule of the FJR 2014 do not appear to cover applications for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     This leads me to my second reason for declining to apply the approach in <em>Mah Kiat Seng</em>. I consider that adopting such an approach would be counterproductive, especially when one considers the principles of therapeutic justice. Adopting an hourly rate to the computation of costs may well serve to promote acrimonious litigation as parties are incentivised to keep track of the score in terms of the time they had spent on proceedings so that they are in a position to make submissions on costs should they prevail. This would only serve to distract parties from focussing on how they can amicably resolve the dispute, heal, and move on and rebuild their lives in a positive way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Ultimately, costs are in the discretion of the court, and a glance at the costs jurisprudence in the Family Courts demonstrates that weight is typically given to factors such as the conduct of parties (<em>XER v XES</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32715-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 4</a>; <em>WQF v WQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32687-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 113</a> at [23]; <em>XBG v XBH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32214-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 81</a>; see also Tan Hui Qing, “The Role of Conduct in the Award of Maintenance and Costs Orders: <em>WUP v WUQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31102-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 15</a>” [2024] SAL Prac 15 at [21] – [22]), and whether the award of costs would risk worsening the acrimony between the parties (<em>JBB</em>; <em>XHS v XHT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32881-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 20</a> at [91] citing <em>BNH v BNI</em> [2013] 283 at [50] and <em>USC v USD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25671-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 4</a> at [9]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32931-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 15</a> at [141]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Apart from these considerations, I also agree with the proposition in <em>Arokiasamy</em> (at [8]) that costs awarded to a successful self-represented person are typically lower than in cases where the litigant is represented by counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     There is, of course, that scenario as described in <em>Chorley</em>: that lawyers who had their own personal litigation in the courts could simply claim the full quantum of costs by hiring another lawyer to represent them. There are, however, good reasons, at least in the context of family disputes, as to why one might wish to engage the counsel of a member of the Family Bar. For one, it is clear that the practice of family law has developed into a specialised field and the role of the modern family lawyer is not limited to merely resolving disputes, but also “rehabilitating relationships, championing resilience and restoring hope”: Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, “Building Hope, Embracing Change” (Speech delivered at the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Celebration of the Family Justice Courts, 21 October 2024) at paragraph 8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my assessment of costs, I considered the numerous items which the Husband had pursued in respect of his applications for discovery and interrogatories. Given the number of items pursued, it was unsurprising that voluminous sets of documents had been filed, and that two tranches of hearing were needed to dispose of both summonses. This spoke to the time and energy that had been expended on both summonses that would justify a higher quantum of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     There was also one other consideration I gave weight to which merited awarding a lower quantum of costs – and that was the conduct of parties. It was clear to me, from the various documents that had been filed (<em>ie</em>, the correspondence between parties that had been exhibited)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that the Husband had, in his pursuit of both summonses, taken a rather adversarial stance which is not acceptable in our family justice system: see <em>XER v XES</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32715-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 4</a> at [4(c)] citing <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As a final point, I would add that the essence of the Husband’s claim for the sum of roughly $40,000 – $80,000 in costs was to compensate him for his lost income in light of the time and effort he had spent on the litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I do not take the Husband’s lost income into account. The Husband had attached correspondence showing that he had obtained a fee quote from at least one member of the Family Bar. Although that fee quote did not factor in applications for discovery and interrogatories, the point remains that the Husband thus had, available to him, what appeared to be a cost-effective option of handling the dispute that would leave him free to focus on his work. Given that he had chosen not to avail himself of this option, I do not think it now open to him to urge this court to consider his lost income in the assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In light of what I have set out above, costs for both SUMs 2478 and 2743 are fixed at $2,500 (all-in).

From the outset, one of the arguments that had been raised by the Respondent was that the Complainant had an “<em>ulterior motive</em>” in filing SS 201 as he was attempting to “<em>fight</em>” for the Child from the Child’s mother (“<b>Mother</b>”), who is the former wife of the Complainant and the current wife of the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In brief, the Complainant and the Child’s mother (“<b>Mother</b>”) were married around November 2015<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Child was born on 17 January 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       An Interim Judgement (“<b>IJ</b>”) was made in respect of the Complainant and the Mother on 9 March 2022. Under the further orders to the IJ, the Complainant and the Mother had consented to an arrangement where both parties’ were to be granted joint custody of the Child, with care and control to the Mother. Access was granted to the Complainant under the IJ. The Final Judgment is dated 13 June 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent’s case was that he and the Mother were married around December 2023. From the time of the marriage, the Respondent claims that he had helped the Mother in taking care of the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. For avoidance of doubt, the Child has been living with the Mother and the Respondent, with the Complainant having access to the Child in accordance with the terms set out under the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant filed SS 201 on 2 February 2024. At the material time, the Child was around 5 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It is not disputed that after SS 201 was filed in February 2024, the Complainant had filed an application on 20 May 2024 to vary the IJ, particularly on the issue of access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Complainant relied on an <em>isolated incident</em> in his Complaint Form that allegedly occurred around Friday, 26 January 2024, whereby he said, in his words, that a “<em>cane alike wound</em>” was spotted on the Child’s right upper arm and that this was caused by the Respondent (“<b>Isolated Incident</b>”). The Complainant claimed that the Child had allegedly stated that “<em>he [was] naughty and Uncle [D] beat him. [D] is his step-father</em>”. He claimed that when the Child’s “<em>school</em>” asked the Child about the alleged wound on Monday, 29 January 2024, the Child had allegedly stated that “<em>Uncle [D]”</em> (the term that the Child used to refer to the Respondent) had beat him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Complainant then filed his first affidavit, where he elaborated on the alleged Isolated Incident. The salient points have been set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant claimed he had picked the Child up from school on 26 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>b.     He claimed that on 27 January 2024, the Complainant’s Mother discovered bruises on the Child’s right upper arm while she was changing him. The Complainant then stated that he understood from his mother that the Child had said that the Respondent had beaten him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Complainant texted the Mother on 28 January 2024. The Mother denied that the Respondent had caused the Child’s bruises. The Complainant also texted the Child’s paternal grandmother, who denied that anyone had hit the Child in the Mother’s residence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Complainant’s Sister and the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend also had an exchange with the Child on what happened to his arm. The Complainant claimed that the Complainant’s Sister informed him that the Child had told her that the Respondent “<em>beat [him]”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>e.     The Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister then brought the Child to visit a doctor where the Child was attended to by Dr S. Dr S expressed that the Child had a <em>“[contusion] of shoulder and upper arm</em>”. Dr S subsequently provided a medical report dated 21 February 2024 (“<b>Medical Report</b>”) stating that the bruises over the Child’s right shoulder could “<em>possibly</em>” represent cane marks<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>f.     Apart from this, the Complainant sent a message to the Child’s school to enquire how the Child got bruises on his arm. The Teacher, namely, one Mdm G, subsequently informed the Complainant that the Child informed her that it was the Respondent who hit him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     After the Complaint Form and Complainant’s first affidavit were filed, it is observed that the Complainant’s counsel made submissions after the event that the Respondent had hit the Child with a cane-like object because the Child had allegedly opened a family member’s room door at night<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Respondent strongly denied the Complainant’s allegations. He claimed that the Complainant had made a false allegation that he had caned the Child. The Respondent’s claims are summarised below<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Respondent’s case was that the Isolated Incident never happened, and he had never hit the Child, be it with his hand or any item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Respondent stated that, on 26 January 2024, the Child had gone to school as per normal and the Mother and the Child’s maternal grandfather had sent him to school. The school had not reported any bruises on the Child. The Child then went to the Complainant’s place for his access session in the evening.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In SS 201, it is observed that the degree of parental conflict between the parties was relatively high, given that it was undisputed that the Complainant had also filed an application relating to the Child’s access after filing SS 201. In addition, the Isolated Incident allegedly occurred when the Child was in the care and control of the Mother. It would thus be apposite to highlight the Court’s observations in the case of <em>WDC v WDD and others</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 58; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27564-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 41</a> at [8]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“In cases where there is high parental conflict with underlying substantive disputes over access (like in the present case), there is a tendency for the parents to point fingers at each other upon discovery of minor injuries on their child. This may often lead to the child being subject to physical examination with every handover for access and the taking of photographic evidence. If there is no family violence or likelihood of family violence, such behaviour is particularly harmful to the child as it brings the child into the direct path of conflict between the parents. As such, it is all the more important to scrutinize the evidence carefully in these cases to determine whether family violence has indeed been committed or is likely to be committed. Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 states that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>65.-</b>(1) The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The law is clear that before a PPO may be granted, two conditions must be satisfied (see section 65 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>WC</b>”); and <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<b><em>UNQ</em></b>”)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against the family member; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, that a PPO is necessary for the protection of that family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The burden is on the Complainant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence has been committed and is likely to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     What constitutes family violence? Under the WC, “<em>family violence</em>” is defined to include the commission of any of the the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>a.     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt (“<b>Limb A</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>b.     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt (“<b>Limb B</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>c.     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>d.     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>e.     but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The protection of a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions. In light of the criminal consequences that follow a breach of a PPO, ordering one is not a decision that the Court would make lightly (<em>UNQ</em> at [28])<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. In <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a>, it was highlighted that at [22]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It bears emphasis that PPOs will not be issued where they are sought to serve a collateral purpose.

In particular, the key issue relates to whether it can be shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the bruises observed on the Child were caused by the Respondent during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>b.     Whether a PPO is necessary to protect the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Whether Family Violence Has Been Committed Or Is Likely To Be Committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The key issue is whether the bruise observed on the Child’s arm had been caused by the Respondent during the material time of the Isolated Incident such that this fell within the scope of the definition of “<em>family violence</em>” under the WC, particularly Limb A and/or Limb B (which the Complainant referred to at page 5 of the Complaint Form).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Having considered the evidence and the submissions, I was unable to find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed against the Child by the Respondent during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident. My reasons are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As a starting point, the Complainant relied on what he claimed <em>he had heard from the Child</em> and what the Witnesses claimed <em>they had heard from the Child</em> to support his argument that the Respondent had allegedly committed family violence against the Child during the material time of the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Complainant submitted that the statements made by the Witnesses on what the Child had allegedly said were admissible under Section 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act 1893 (“<b>EA</b>”) read with Section 120 of the EA. The Complainant’s arguments on this point are summarised below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant highlighted that the Child, who was at the young age of around 5 years old at the material time, had delayed speech development and difficulties in expressing himself. As such, the Complainant argued that the Child was not competent to testify as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>b.     Thus, the Complainant’s submission was that the Child’s statements that had been relayed to the Witnesses were admissible under the EA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Complainant also submitted that the Child’s statements were cogent and buttressed by the fact that the Child repeated this statement multiple times<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     My observations on the Complainant’s arguments are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     First, in respect of the Complainant’s argument that the Child was <em>not</em> competent to testify as a witness, it was difficult to reconcile this argument with the Complainant’s other argument that the Child’s alleged statements were “<em>cogent</em>”. It did not logically flow that the Child’s statements could be relied on as “<em>cogent</em>” statements, when the Complainant was also attempting to argue that the Child was not competent to testify due to the Child’s delayed speech development and difficulties in expressing himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Second, the burden is on the Complainant, who is seeking to rely on section 32(1)(j)(i) of the EA, to prove that the Child was unfit to attend as a witness. While the Complainant cited the case of <em>UUX v UUW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23896-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 137</a> as an example where an application to call a young child as a witness was rejected, I observed from the said case that the District Judge had the benefit of assessing the child’s evidence and demeanour via video-link <em>before</em> making the determination to reject the relevant application at [12]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. In the present case, apart from the lack of opportunity to observe the Child’s demeanour, there was also a lack of evidence provided by the Complainant, such as any medical report, that expressly indicated that the Child was too young or that his mental condition rendered him unable to testify for the Court to make any determinative findings on the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Third, even if I had found that the alleged statements that the Child made were admissible under the EA, due consideration must be given to the <em>weight</em> to be accorded to these alleged statements. On this point, I observed that the Complainant, himself, had expressed concerns that the Child could be coached and/or indirectly pressured. As such, I found it difficult to place much weight, if at all, on the Child’s statements. I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>a.     In the present case, it is observed that the Complainant and the Respondent’s counsel had <em>both</em> tried to cast doubt on the veracity of the statements that the Child had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>b.     As stated above, the Complainant had expressed concerns that the Child could be coached and/or indirectly pressured. In particular, the Complainant had highlighted that when he returned the Child to the Mother on 28 January 2024 (<em>after</em> the Isolated Incident), the Child had initially told the Mother that the Respondent hit him. However, the Complainant said that when the Mother repeated her question to the Child, the Child then claimed that his injuries were caused by a fall. The Complainant then said he was “<em>worried</em>” and “<em>concerned</em>” about the Mother indirectly pressuring the Child to say the “<em>correct</em>” answer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>c.     Furthermore, when the Complainant was asked during cross-examination whether the Child tells “<em>fibs</em>”, he claimed that the Child is “<em>very cheeky</em>” and “<em>does tell white lies at times</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Complainant also did not dispute that he had sent the WhatsApp message exhibited at page 71 of R1 where he affirmed that he had made the following statement in relation to the Child: <em>“I know he lies, and we always tell him not to. If no tell lies, we will give him present.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>e.     In view of the Complainant’s own position that the Child has told lies and the Complainant’s own concerns of the Child’s propensity to be indirectly pressured by his parents, this created doubt as to the veracity of the Child’s statements that were allegedly made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Fourth, apart from the Complainant, it must be reiterated that the Respondent’s counsel had also attempted to cast doubt on the statements the Child had made. This is elaborated upon below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Respondent’s counsel referred to a transcript submitted by the Complainant in C2 where the Child is recorded to have said to the Mother during a call that, “<em>Uncle [D] beat me</em>”, on 3 February 2024 (“<b>Relevant Transcript</b>”). In response, the Respondent’s counsel argued that the Complainant was coaching the Child <em>before</em> the call with the Mother, whereby the Complainant is recorded to have said “<em>Remember ah, mama ask you, want to go mama house, if you say yes papa will send you back. Then Uncle [D], you will see him already ok? If you don’t want to go, you must tell mama don’t want to go mama house.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>b.     In this regard, the Respondent’s counsel raised the point that it was odd that, at the outset, the Child had first said that the Respondent had beat him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>c.     After reviewing the contents of the Relevant Transcript, I observed as a preliminary point that it was unclear <em>who</em> prepared the transcript as there was no certification to be found on the said transcript.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>d.     Nevertheless, even if the Relevant Transcript could be relied upon, it is noted that the transcript related to an event on 4 February 2024 which was around <em>more than a week</em> after the material time that the alleged Isolated Incident was expected to have occurred (i.e. in or around 24 to 26 January 2024, as submitted by the Complainant). Based on the Relevant Transcript, the Complainant’s words to the Child could be construed as a form of coaching on his part where he instructed the Child that he “<em>must tell</em>” the Mother that he did not want to go to the Mother’s house. The prompts provided by the Complainant to the Child cast doubt on the reliability of the Child’s statements, particular the Child’s alleged claim that the Respondent had allegedly beaten him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_e\"></a>e.     Given that the Complainant had his own concerns on the Child’s propensity to be indirectly pressured and given that he appeared to have been coaching the Child himself, I could not rely or place much weight on what the Child allegedly stated from the Relevant Transcript to find that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, the Complainant’s own concerns on the veracity of the Child’s statements cast doubt on all of the claims that the Child had allegedly made to the Complainant and the Witnesses. It was thus difficult to rely on the assertions the Child had made as evidence as to the truth of the contents therein and I could not place much weight, if at all, on such statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     This leads me to the observation that the Complainant’s allegations were largely based were based on hearsay evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The thrust of the Complainant’s claims were premised on what he claimed the Child had allegedly said to him or what the Witnesses told him about what the Child had conveyed to them. As the Complainant <em>himself</em> had doubts as to the veracity of certain statements that the Child had made, it was difficult for me to rely on the Complainant’s statements (which were largely based on what he claimed that he had heard from the Child), to find that he had satisfied the burden of proof that lay on him to demonstrate that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance on probabilities. I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Complainant’s various statements on the Isolated Incident and what occurred thereafter appeared to be inconsistent, as highlighted during the cross-examination. For example, in the Complaint Form, the Complainant stated that he discovered the bruise on the Child on <em>26 January 2024</em>. However, on the stand during the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, he claimed that he had only discovered the bruise on the Child on the morning of <em>27 January 2024</em>. When the Respondent’s counsel asked the Complainant whether he agreed that his version in the Complaint Form differed from the version in his first affidavit, the Complainant confirmed that this was correct<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant had also <em>agreed</em> when the Respondent’s counsel had put it to him that he had mentioned “<em>inconsistent days in the days in the documents</em>” before the Court. In particular, it is also noted that the Complainant did not disagree when the Respondent’s counsel put it to him that he had <em>inconsistent timings</em> in the documents before the Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, the Complainant did <em>not</em> witness the Respondent hit the Child. On the stand, when the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”. When the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had <em>ever</em> seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. As such, it was difficult for me to rely on the Complainant’s account to find that the Respondent had caused the bruises observed on the Child’s arm, when the Complainant had not witnessed what had occurred during the material time of the Isolated Incident and when he had admitted that he had never seen the Respondent hit the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>c.     As the Complainant did not witness what had occurred during the material time of the Isolated Incident, I could not rely on what he claimed the Child told him or what the other Witnesses claimed the Child had told them to make affirmative findings that the Respondent had beaten and/or caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To summarise, in the absence of clear particulars relating to what had transpired during the material time of the Isolated Incident, the inconsistencies in the Complainant’s documents, as well as the lack of clear evidence that the Respondent had beaten and/or hit the Child (given that the Complainant admitted he had never witnessed this before), I could not rely on the Complainant’s statements to find that the Complainant had sufficiently shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I now turn to the Respondent’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Respondent repeatedly denied the Complainant’s allegations. In particular, during cross-examination, the Complainant’s counsel put the following statements to the Respondent, which he disagreed with<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Okay. I put it to you that you had sufficient opportunity that night---on<em>---</em>on---on the days prior to the 27th when [the Child] said that he woke up in the middle of the night and you lost your temper, and you struck him. Agree or disagree?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A     <em>Disagree</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    At 2:00, 3:00, 4:00am, <em>everyone</em> else would have been sleeping, I put it to you that when you hit the child, no one else would have known or no one would have seen because everyone else would have been in bed. Correct or incorrect?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A     <em>Incorrect</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     From the above extract, it would be pertinent to highlight the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Respondent repeatedly denied that he had struck or hit the Child. This was consistent with the position he maintained during the relevant hearings over the course of the trial and in his documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, certain statements that were put to the Respondent by the Complainant’s counsel during cross-examination had <em>not</em> been mentioned in the Complaint Form. For example, under the Complaint Form, the Complainant had <em>not</em> suggested that it was his case that the Respondent had hit the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident in the middle of the night or between “<em>2:00, 3:00, 4:00am</em>”, when everyone else was sleeping (as put by the Complainant’s counsel to the Respondent during cross-examination). Furthermore, it is also noted that it was only in the Complainant’s submissions that it had been suggested that the Respondent hit the Child with a cane-like object for opening his family member’s room door at night. These explanations appear to only have been provided by the Complainant as an afterthought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, even if it were the Complainant’s case that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child in the middle of the night during the material time of the Isolated Incident, I found it unusual that the Complainant’s counsel had suggested that “<em>no one else would have known or no one would have seen</em>”, as there was a high likelihood that the Child would have cried or expressed discomfort if the Respondent had indeed struck or hit the Child, causing the “<em>cane alike</em>” wound that the Complainant had described. Furthermore, the Complainant’s counsel submitted that the Respondent had hit the Child “<em>because he was naughty for opening a door</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. From the said argument, it could only be inferred that the Complainant had been implicitly suggesting that the reason why the Child was naughty for opening the door was that he would be disturbing his family members (resulting in the alleged punishment of the Child). Even if this were the case, this argument did not square with the Complainant’s argument that the rest of the Child’s family members at the Mother’s residence would not have woken up or have been alerted to the Child’s cries if the Respondent had hit the Child in the manner the Complainant suggested in the middle of the night (at a timing that remained unspecified and unclear based on the Complainant’s own case).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d.     Fourth, as stated above, there was a lack of clarity as to what time or on which exact day the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child during the material time of the Isolated Incident, much less other supporting documents or further evidence to corroborate the Complainant’s counsel’s submissions that the Child had been hit between “<em>2:00, 3:00, 4:00am</em>” with a “<em>cane-like</em>” object by the Respondent for opening a door. For example, there was no video or photographic evidence produced to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly struck the Child. The Complainant also did not produce any evidence that the Respondent had a cane, which the Respondent denied possessing. The Complainant had also not made any application to summon the Mother, or the Child’s maternal grandparents, who were allegedly around at the Mother’s residence during the material time of the Isolated Incident, as witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     For completeness, I also considered that the Complainant’s counsel had tried to rely on the following portions of the NE2 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, during the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing to claim that the Respondent had allegedly admitted to hitting the Child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_Q\"></a>Q     <em>[The Mother] does not know you hit [the Child], correct?</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_A\"></a>A     <em>Yes.

I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>a.     Having examined the Respondent’s answer (i.e. “<em>yes</em>”) in response to the question, <em>“[the Mother] does not know you hit [the Child], correct?”</em>, it was unclear whether the Respondent had understood or heard the Complainant counsel’s question correctly in the context of the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>b.     In particular, the Respondent had been interrupted while attempting to answer the above question, as evinced by the transcript where he stated (i.e. “Yes. <em>Um—</em>&quot;). On this point, the immediate statement that the Respondent had made after saying “<em>Yes. Um---”</em> was to ask the Complainant’s counsel to repeat her question which related to the alleged hitting of the Child (i.e. “<em>Sorry, can you repeat that again?</em>”). However, in between the two statements, the Complainant’s counsel had asked the Complainant a <em>separate</em> and <em>distinct</em> question (i.e. “<em>That’s why she agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to you pending investigations on 29th Jan, correct?”).</em> In response to the Respondent’s request for the Complainant’s counsel to repeat the question again, the Complainant’s counsel did <em>not</em> repeat the material question (i.e. whether the Mother knew the Respondent had hit the Child) and had only repeated the following “<em>That’s why she even agreed for [the Child] to be handed over to [the Complainant] pending investigations on 29th Jan, correct?”</em>, to which the Respondent then claimed that the Mother had handed the Child to the Complainant because the Complainant was worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>c.     The above exchange created doubt as to whether the Respondent had understood the import of the Complainant’s counsel’s question clearly, especially when he had requested for the question to be repeated to him and the material question had <em>not</em> been repeated. As such, I could not place much weight on the same to find that this had amounted to an unequivocal admission that the Respondent had hit the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, particularly when there was no other incident being relied on by the Complainant to suggest that the Respondent had hit the Child and there was a lack of corroborative evidence to support this finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_d\"></a>d.     For completeness, I also considered that the Respondent had consistently maintained the position in denying that he had ever hit the Child. In particular, the Respondent had maintained from the outset in the ROS that his position was clear in that he had never hit the Child and that the burden was on the Complainant to prove that the Respondent had allegedly “<em>caned</em>” the Child (which the Respondent denied)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, I note that when the Complainant’s counsel had put it to the Respondent that the Mother had suspicions that he caused the Child’s injuries and bruises, the Respondent’s response was that this was “<em>incorrect</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_e\"></a>e.     Given that the above excerpt of the NE2 (particularly, page 106 of NE2) was the only portion of the relevant NEs relied on by the Complainant’s counsel at paragraph 18 of CS to assert that the Respondent had admitted to hitting the Child, it was difficult to rely on the singular exchange (set out above) to find that the Respondent had clearly admitted to hitting the Child during the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As such, I could not rely on the above to find that the Complainant had sufficiently proved that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. The Complainant had also failed to clearly rebut the Respondent’s claims during the trial, given that there was a lack of objective evidence to support the allegation that it was the Respondent who hit the Child, such as <em>when</em> the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child or <em>what</em> the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Letter of Warning</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I turn to address the Complainant’s argument that the Respondent had admitted in cross-examination that a letter of warning had been issued to him by the Singapore Police Force (“<b>SPF</b>”) on 8 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The essence of the Complainant’s argument was that Respondent’s admission that he had been administered a warning by the SPF lends weight to the Complainant’s claim that the Respondent caused the Child’s injuries<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Having considered the above, while the Respondent had been issued with a letter of warning from the SPF, the Complainant did not show how the letter of warning could be relied upon for the Court to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. This is especially since the Court of Appeal had affirmed in the case of <em>Teo Seng Tiong v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26218-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 65</a> at [82] to [88] that stern warnings, whether conditional or not, have no legal effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Complainant’s Sister, Complainant’s Mother and Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I then turned to consider the statements made by the Complainant’s family members, as well as the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On balance, the statements made by the Complainant’s family members created even more uncertainty as whether the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I elaborate on this below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     First, the Complainant’s Sister’s statements were <em>not</em> consistent as to how the Respondent had allegedly caused the bruise on the Child. In particular:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant’s Sister was <em>not</em> present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Complainant’s Sister claimed that the Child had informed her that the Respondent had beat him. The Complainant’s Sister claimed that the Child first told her that the Respondent used a “<em>toy</em>”. However, it seemed that the Child later suggested that the Respondent had used a “<em>line</em>”. These alleged statements made by the Child created confusion as to how the bruise had been allegedly caused by the Respondent (e.g. had the Respondent hit the Child with an alleged “<em>line</em>” or a “<em>toy</em>”?). As such, I could not rely on these purported statements to find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, as there was a lack of certainty on how the bruises developed on the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>c.     Critically, there was a lack of objective corroborative evidence provided by the Complainant or the Complainant’s Sister to demonstrate the type of object that was allegedly used by the Respondent to cause the bruise observed on the Child. This is bearing in mind that it is unclear what a “<em>line</em>” or a “<em>toy</em>” referred to. If the Complainant or his sister were claiming that the Respondent had used a cane to hit him, it was unusual as to why a Child would refer to a cane as a “<em>toy</em>”. This has not been clearly explained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_d\"></a>d.     For completeness, I had also considered that the Complainant’s Sister had filed a Police Report No.: L/20240127/7046 (“<b>Police Report</b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. However, I could not place much weight on the said Police Report. Of note, the Complainant’s Sister claimed that she had prepared the <em>draft</em> Police Report to be filed but she had held back on making the relevant report while the Complainant was talking to the Mother. In particular, she mentioned that she had submitted the police report upon the Complainant’s instructions. She also stated that the Complainant had “<em>made [her]…submit the draft</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. As the Complainant’s Sister’s account in the said report was based on what the Child had allegedly informed her and she was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, I was unable to attribute much weight to the statements that had been made in the said Police Report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Second, the Complainant’s Mother’s statements were also not consistent. In particular:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>a.     I would first set out that the Complainant’s Mother was also <em>not</em> present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident to demonstrate that the Respondent had allegedly hit the Child. She expressly confirmed on the stand that her evidence was based purely on what the Child had told her whereby she claimed that the Child had said that the Respondent beat him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>b.     In addition, her testimony on the stand as to <em>when</em> she had noticed the bruise on the Child was inconsistent whereby she initially claimed that this was on <em>26 January 2024</em>, but subsequently claimed that this was on <em>27<sup></sup>January 2024</em>, during cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>c.     As such, it was also difficult to rely on the Complainant’s Mother’s testimony to find that the Complainant had satisfied the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that it was the Respondent who had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Third, in respect of the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend, I could not place any weight on his testimony as he confirmed on the stand that he was <em>not</em> present when the Complainant’s Mother discovered the bruise on the Child. He also confirmed that he had never seen the Respondent hitting the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In view of the above, I could place much weight, if at all, on the statements made by the Complainant’s Witnesses, particularly, his relevant family members, bearing in mind that none of them had been present during the alleged material time of the Isolated Incident. Their statements were also largely premised on what they claimed the Child conveyed to them. As demonstrated above, given the Complainant’s concerns on the veracity of the Child’s statements, I could not place much weight, if at all, on the claims the Child had allegedly made to the said Witnesses. For completeness, I also had doubts as to the objectivity of observations or statements made by the Complainant’s family members and the Complainant’s Sister’s Boyfriend against the Respondent due to the high-conflict nature of the present dispute and the acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant Doctors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Complainant also called two doctors as witnesses to testify in this matter. The first doctor being Dr S and the second doctor being Dr P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Dr S’s claims are summarised below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Complainant highlighted that Dr S testified that bruises on the Child could possibly represent cane marks. Dr S also claimed that based on photos that were taken of the Child’s bruises, the bruises were between 0 to 3 days old<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant used this opinion to highlight that, on 24 to 26 January 2024, the Child was in the Mother’s care, before the Complainant had access to the Child after school on 26 January 2024, and that this pointed to the fact that the injuries <em>could have</em> been inflicted during this period. Specifically, the Complainant relied on Dr S’s testimony to claim that the relevant injuries were inflicted on the Child “<em>on or around 24 January 2024</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>b.     When cross-examined on the Child’s bruise, it is noted that Dr S had stated the following<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“<em>[It] is plausible that the bruise could have been caused by hitting something</em>. However, let me state that that in the absence of any tenderness around the wound, it is much more likely that a light object struck him rather than he hit an object with a force of his body. This is because when you hit---well, when a person hits and object with a force of the body, then there is the weight, the mass and therefore, the energy behind that body that tends to cause more swelling and tenderness.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While Dr S raised the probability that it was likely that the Child’s bruise was caused by a light object that struck him, I could not rely on this claim to find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the bruise had been caused by the Respondent. I had to consider Dr S’s statements in the context of the totality of the evidence in the case. I elaborate on my reasons below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, Dr S, like the rest of the Witnesses, had <em>not</em> been present during the material time of the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence to demonstrate <em>what</em> or <em>who</em> had caused the Child’s bruise. Dr S himself had claimed that it was <em>plausible</em> that the Child’s bruise could have been caused by the Child “<em>hitting something</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. However, he also further confirmed on the stand that he could <em>not</em> definitively say that the bruise was caused by a cane. As such, where Dr S could <em>not</em> confirm that the bruise observed on the Child was caused by a cane, it was difficult to see how the Complainant could show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, as for Dr S’s claim that the bruises were about 0 to 3 days old around 27 January 2024, I was hard pressed to see how the Complainant could argue that this meant that the Respondent had definitively caused the bruises on the Child. It was difficult to see how the Complainant arrived at the assumption that the Respondent had hit the Child on this basis alone, when Dr S could <em>not</em> comment with any certainty on the exact date where the bruises had begun to develop, much less show that the alleged bruise had been caused during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>d.     Fourth, Dr S had raised the possibility that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something, and it is noted that the Complainant expressly confirmed that the Child was also at school on 26 January 2024 during the window of the period where Dr S opined the bruise could have been caused (i.e. that the “<em>bruises were between 0 to 3 days old</em>” based on the photos on 27 January 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>). As such, I could not rely on Dr S’s claims to find that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child due to the lack of certainty as to <em>when</em> the bruise was caused and <em>where</em> the bruise had been caused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_e\"></a>e.     Fifth, as the Respondent’s counsel had highlighted, Dr S had also confirmed on the stand during cross-examination that he had relied solely on the information from the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister in his affidavit and that he had <em>not</em> conducted an independent assessment to verify the claims provided by them<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. As such, given that Dr S was not present during the material time of the Isolated Incident, coupled with the fact that he had relied on the self-reports made by the Complainant and Complainant’s Sister as part of the basis in which he formed his opinion, I could not rely on these statements to arrive at a finding that it was the Respondent who had allegedly hit the Child during the Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Next, I considered Dr P’s testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In particular, Dr P claimed that there was “<em>suspected abuse</em>” in relation to the Child. In this regard, it was difficult for me to place much reliance on Dr P’s testimony to find that the Complainant had sufficiently shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, Dr P was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, Dr P had confirmed that she was <em>not</em> the one who had the “<em>suspected</em>” that the Child had been abused<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. When she was questioned as to why she used the term “<em>suspected abuse</em>” in relation to the Child on 2 March 2024, she claimed that this was based on a referring memo where the reasons and circumstances were described to her by Dr S, as well as what the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had described.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>c.     Third, insofar as Dr P had relied on Dr S’s description of the circumstances, Dr S had based this on what the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had informed him. As mentioned above, the Complainant and the Complainant’s Sister had <em>not</em> been present at the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident. As such, I could not place much weight on Dr P’s testimony to find that the Child had been the subject of “<em>suspected abuse</em>” or that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>d.     In sum, it was difficult to rely on Dr P’s statements to find that the Complainant had satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed by the Respondent against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the above, I could not find that the Complainant had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. As it stands, most of the views and opinions that were expressed by Dr S and Dr P were predominantly based on “<em>self-reports</em>” made by the Complainant and his family members. As such, their views could not be relied upon to prove that family violence had been committed by the Respondent against the Child. As set out above, Dr P admitted that her report was based on Dr S’s description, which was based on self-reporting. Insofar as the doctors relied on the claims of the Complainant and his family members when preparing the reports, it was difficult to rely on the said reports as independent and objective means to verify the Complainant’s claims that the Respondent had allegedly committed family violence against the Child. This is especially since there was a lack of certainty as to the date on which the Child had allegedly been hit. There was also a lack of documentary evidence to show that the Respondent had hit the Child, much less what type of object had been used by the Respondent. For completeness, based on the pictures provided by the Complainant relating to the bruise that had been observed on the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, it was also difficult to rely on such pictures alone to find that it was the Respondent who had hit or caned the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Furthermore, even though Dr S had highlighted that the bruises of the Child <em>could</em> represent cane marks, this could not be relied upon alone to find that the Respondent had caused the bruises on the Child, as Dr S had also raised the <em>plausibility</em> that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Teacher</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     This leads me to the Teacher’s account, whereby the Teacher conveyed that the Child said to her that the Respondent had beat him. I could not accord much weight to the Teacher’s statements as the Teacher did <em>not</em> witness the alleged Isolated Incident. Moreover, the Teacher raised further <em>possibilities</em> on how the Child could have developed the bruise:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, the Teacher highlighted the possibility that the Child could have sustained the relevant bruise in school. In particular, when the Teacher was asked during cross-examination whether it was common for young boys of the Child’s age to hit things and injure themselves, she claimed that “<em>it also happens</em>” and that she “<em>couldn’t say that it’s not a possibility that [it happened] in school</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Teacher’s statement during cross-examination was also consistent with her statement in her affidavit that she <em>“could not rule out the possibility that the [Child’s] injury was sustained in school</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, while the Teacher stated in her affidavit that she was “<em>more inclined towards believing the [Child’s] version of events</em>”, I could not place much weight on her opinion as the Teacher was not present during the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident and she did not show why the Child’s version of the events should be relied on to arrive at a finding that the Respondent had hit the Child during the alleged Isolated Incident. This is also bearing in mind that the Complainant had raised doubts as to the veracity of the statements that the Child had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>c.     In view of the above, I could not rely on the Teacher’s Statement to find that the Complainant had satisfied the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child. This is also in consideration that the Teacher had raised the <em>alternative possibility</em> that the Child’s injury could have occurred at school, coupled with the fact that Dr S had also raised the <em>plausibility</em> that the bruises could have been caused by the Child hitting something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Having considered the testimonies and evidence of the Complainant and the Witnesses, I could not find that the Complainant had proved that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Likelihood</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It remains for me to consider whether there is any likelihood of family violence being committed against the Child by the Respondent. After considering the allegations raised by the Complainant in the Complaint Form and in C1, I was unable to find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed against the Child or that family violence was likely to be committed against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Prior to the Isolated Incident, it is noted that when the Complainant was questioned on whether the Child had ever said that the Respondent had hit him between December 2022 to January 2024, the Complainant said that there was <em>no incident</em> he could remember<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>. For completeness, I also considered his claim that, prior to the material time of the alleged Isolated Incident, the Complainant and the Mother had a largely harmonious co-parenting relationship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As there was a lack of evidence that the Respondent had hit the Child or that he had a propensity to commit family violence, I could not find that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence would likely be committed by the Respondent against the Child, particularly under Limb A and/or Limb B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As the Complainant had not satisfied the legal burden of proving that family violence had been committed or was likely to be committed against the Child, it would follow that a PPO would not be necessary in this case. In any event, it would have been difficult to arrive at a finding that a PPO was necessary in this case for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>a.     First, during the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearings, it was not disputed that the Child continued to stay with the Mother and Respondent at the Mother’s residence. It is also observed that there were also other family members present at the residence, particularly, the Child’s maternal grandparents who also lived with him. The Complainant had not clearly established that the Mother or the Child’s maternal grandparents could not be relied upon to ensure that the Child was safe. For completeness, I note that the Complainant also continued to have access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>b.     Second, apart from the lack of evidence adduced by the Complainant to prove that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child, it must be stressed that the Complainant’s allegations related to a single instance where the bruises had been spotted on the Child to form the basis of his complaint in the Complaint Form. As stated above, when the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”. When the Complainant was questioned during cross-examination on whether he had <em>ever</em> seen the Respondent hit the Child, the Complainant’s response was “<em>no</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. As such, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that a PPO was necessary to restrain the Respondent from committing family violence in the future against the Child, when the Complainant had not witnessed the Respondent hit the Child and in view of the lack of evidence to corroborate the finding that the Respondent had committed family violence against the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In the circumstances, I was unable to grant the Complainant’s application in SS 201.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     On the issue of costs, the Respondent’s counsel submitted that the sum of $25,000 should be ordered in favour of the Respondent. Broadly speaking, she submitted that there were several witnesses on the Complainant’s end who had mostly filed substantive affidavits with transcripts and recordings. In addition, she highlighted that there were supplementary affidavits filed on the first day of the trial, whereby the trial had to be heard in two tranches, with opening statements and written closing submissions that had been submitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In brief, the Complainant’s counsel submitted that costs of $7,000 would be more appropriate in the present case where the trial was over two days and there were co-parenting issues between the parties. The Complainant’s counsel also asked that the Complainant be allowed to pay any such costs over the course of six months due to his cash flow issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Given that the Complainant had not succeeded in his application, the Respondent would ordinarily be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Having considered the submissions of both parties, the number of affidavits filed, the fact that further affidavits were produced by the Complainant during the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, the fact that a reply affidavit had to further be directed on the Respondent’s part, the written submissions, the relevant opening statements, the number of authorities filed by both parties, as well as the number of witnesses and court attendances for SS 201, the Complainant was ordered to pay costs of $12,000 (all-in), in monthly instalments of $2,000 over the course of six months commencing from 23 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Going forward, the reality is that the parties would need to continue to journey together in co-parenting the Child. I observe that the Child is deeply loved by his family and has a strong eco-system, with a caring immediate and extended family (e.g. his grandparents, aunts, etc.). I strongly encourage parties to draw on their love for the Child to work on showing kindness and grace to each other for the sake of the Child’s well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     It is my sincere hope that the harmonious co-parenting relationship that the Complainant had claimed he shared with the Mother will be restored. It is difficult for children to be caught in the middle of parental conflicts, and I would encourage all parties to explore counselling on how to communicate and co-parent in the best interests of the Child.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 3 of ROS.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 23 of R1.

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff Wife and the Defendant Husband were married on 2 October 2011. The Plaintiff filed her Writ for Divorce on 16 January 2023. The interim judgment was granted on 12 April 2023 (the “IJ”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff was 53 years old at the time of hearing. The Defendant was 63 years old. There were no children of the marriage, although the Plaintiff had two adult children from his previous marriage and the Defendant had one adult child from her previous marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The ancillary matters came up before me for hearing on 19 September 2024. I delivered my decision on 25 October 2024. The only issues for my determination were the division of the matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance. In respect of the former, the parties had agreed on the pool of matrimonial assets, save that the Plaintiff contended that: (i) the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, and that a certain sum should consequently be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets to account for this; and (ii) that the Defendant had transferred a sum of $71,356.44 to his friend which should be added back into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I ultimately determined that: (i) a sum of $101,874.69 should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets on account of the shares that were dissipated by the Defendant; and (ii) the sum of $71,356.44 transferred by the Defendant to his friend should also be added back into the pool. I valued the total pool of matrimonial assets at $1,096,817.10 and determined that this should be divided in the proportion of 75% to the Defendant and 25% to the Plaintiff. I further ordered that there should be no spousal maintenance for the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Plaintiff has since appealed specifically against my computation of the amount to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets owing to the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X. My decision here will therefore focus on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Company X was incorporated in 2009 by the Defendant and his friend, A. They each contributed $10,000 towards the start-up capital. The Defendant and A were the only directors and shareholders of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 19 May 2015, the Defendant transferred all 250,000 of his shares in Company X to his elder child, C1. C1 was 23 years old and a university student at the time. This transfer was approved by himself and A as directors of Company X<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. On the same day, the Defendant tendered his letter of resignation to relinquish his position as a director of Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For reasons that are disputed, though his shares were transferred to C1 on 19 May 2015, the Defendant continued as a director of Company X until 21 August 2018, when C1 was made a director of the company in his place. C1 was 26 years old at that point, and remained a university student.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Although the Defendant had ceased to be the legal owner of the shares as at the date of the interim judgment, the Plaintiff nevertheless posited that the value of those shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff’s case was that the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X to C1 was an act of wrongful dissipation intended to deplete the pool of matrimonial assets at a time where the divorce was imminent. The Plaintiff argued that the shares were sold to C1 at an undervalue, that the Defendant’s narrative surrounding the disposal of his shares was untrue, and that the Defendant’s explanation for the transfer was unbelievable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Defendant’s position was that the sale of his shares to C1 was a legitimate one done at a fair and accurate market value. The Defendant disagreed that divorce proceedings were imminent at the time of sale. The Defendant consequently objected to the value of the shares being added to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined and the applicable law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Generally, the starting point in an exercise to divide the matrimonial assets is the identification of matrimonial assets and their respective values. The default operative date to determine the assets in the matrimonial pool is the date of the interim judgment, though the court retains the discretion to depart from this default position (see <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [31]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, simply identifying all the assets and liabilities in existence as at the operative date may not always sufficiently reflect the true material gains of the marriage, and therefore may not result in a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. This may be the case where an asset was expended <em>prior</em> to the operative date, such that the value of the asset would not be reflected in the pool of assets, to the benefit of the party who disposed of the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To achieve an equitable outcome, the court is therefore empowered to add certain sums back into the pool of matrimonial assets. <em>Where divorce proceedings are imminent</em>, the court may order a substantial sum expended by one party to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets if the other spouse was considered to have at least a putative interest in it and had not agreed to the expenditure, whether or not the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets or not (see <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, even <em>before divorce is imminent</em> (or the grant of interim judgment), where it is proven on the facts and evidence that an expenditure amounts to wrongful dissipation with the intention of depleting the matrimonial pool, the court may add a sum back into the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [66] to [68]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     With the relevant authorities in mind, I considered the following two questions to determine whether the value of the shares in the company should be added to the pool:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Were divorce proceedings imminent at or around May 2015; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Did the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amount to wrongful dissipation?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     If I were to determine that the value of the shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, then I would have to decide what notional amount I should add to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 1: Whether divorce proceedings were imminent at or around May 2015</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I first considered if divorce proceedings were imminent at or around the time that the Defendant transferred the shares to C1, <em>i.e.</em> on 19 May 2015. If divorce was imminent, I could, per the dicta in <em>TNL</em>, add the value of the shares back to the pool of matrimonial assets, whether or not the Defendant had deliberately attempted to dissipate the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Plaintiff argued that the parties’ marital relationship was no longer functioning at this time, and that divorce between the parties was imminent. The circumstances drawn up by the Plaintiff were as such: in April 2015, the Defendant committed family violence against her. This led to the Plaintiff applying for a personal protection order in or around May 2015, which she subsequently withdrew upon the Defendant providing an undertaking at a mention on 23 June 2015 that he would not use family violence against her. Around this time, the Defendant threatened her with divorce and reduced her allowance. Viewed as a whole, the Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant’s conduct indicated that the ‘prospect of divorce’ was already on his mind at the time. The Plaintiff suggested that the Defendant only withheld filing for a divorce at that time to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1), which formed the basis for the grant of the IJ, did not rely exclusively on events in or around May 2015; nor did it cite the events in or around May 2015 as the core reason for the divorce. Rather, it referred to events even after May 2015 and suggested that the parties’ relationship had deteriorated over the years after the altercation in 2015, and that it was a cumulation of events that resulted in the breakdown of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The fact of the matter is that the Writ for Divorce was only filed some eight years later. The Plaintiff withdrew the PPO, ostensibly with the hope of reconciliation. After May 2015, the parties even went on various overseas holidays as a couple between 2017 and 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff could have filed for a divorce herself at any time earlier, but did not do so. She consciously chose to stay in the marriage, even if for material reasons only. In the Plaintiff’s affidavits, she expressed her disappointment at the Defendant’s efforts to the marriage, which suggested that she continued to hold expectations of him as her husband over the years, even after 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It therefore appeared to me that the love might have been lost, but the marriage very much remained. I was not satisfied on the evidence that divorce was imminent at that point in time, and did not accept the Plaintiff’s hypothesis that the Defendant only resisted filing for a divorce all those years just to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 2: Whether the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amounted to wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Notwithstanding my finding that the divorce was not imminent in May 2015, I examined if the Defendant’s shares in Company X were wrongfully dissipated. If so, the court may nevertheless add the value of these shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets, even if divorce was not imminent at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Were the Defendant’s shares transacted at an undervalue?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I first considered the value of the consideration that the Defendant said he received for the shares. While the adequacy of the consideration received might not in itself be determinative of the legitimacy of the transfer, the disposal of shares for consideration less than its true value might indicate that the transfer should not simply be taken at face value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this regard, the Defendant’s position was that the consideration of $150,000 was intentionally calculated to “<em>accurately reflect the market value of the shares</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant explained his calculation as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The principal amount of $359,820.98, based on the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of the 250,000 shares in Company X as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet C for Transfer of Shares (“IRAS Working Sheet”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Divided by two, <em>i.e.</em> $179,910.49, because half of the shares were held on C1’s behalf, and that C1 therefore only needed to pay him for the Defendant’s half of the shares; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Less the sum of $29,500, being the Defendant’s estimation of the company’s losses in 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Shy of any better evidence, I accepted the NAV as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet. This document purported to contain information from the company’s management accounts as at 31 January 2015, which preceded the events in April 2015 cited by the Plaintiff. There was nothing put forth by the Plaintiff to suggest that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable, nor did the valuers engaged by the Plaintiff (the “Plaintiff’s Valuers”) suggest that there was something untoward about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I found the rest of the Defendant’s formula to be problematic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Firstly, there was a slight inaccuracy in the Defendant’s calculation, as applying his formula should result in the amount of $150,410.49, not $150,000. No explanation was given for using the lesser sum, not even an explanation that he chose to round it down for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Secondly, by the Defendant’s own admission, there were no documents or correspondences exchanged between Company X, C1 and himself evidencing how the consideration of $150,000 was actually determined at the time of the transfer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Thirdly, and importantly, I did not accept the Defendant’s reasons for dividing the NAV of his 250,000 shares in two. The Defendant claimed that C1, who was only around 17 years old at the time, was the beneficial owner of half the shares because he used $5,000 of C1’s <em>ang bao</em> monies (that the Defendant had saved up over the years on C1’s behalf) toward the start-up capital of Company X. I found this be a weak and baseless claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no documentary evidence showing that the Defendant had taken a sum of $5,000 that belonged to C1, or that C1 was the beneficial owner of half of the shares, whether such evidence took the form of a trust deed, or even contemporaneous emails or messages. The Defendant simply relied on a bare assertion that at the material time, he had a verbal agreement with C1 that he would hold C1’s shares in his name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I noted that this assertion was not even something that C1 himself corroborated on affidavit, despite C1 having filed two affidavits in these proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It seemed inconceivable that the Defendant did not have the sum of $5,000 at his disposal at the time, such that he had to rely on C1’s savings. There was also no explanation as to why the Defendant could not have taken this sum of $5,000 as a loan from C1 instead. Similarly, there was no explanation as to why he did not include C1 as a shareholder of the company any earlier, if he was indeed the beneficial owner of half of the Defendant’s shares;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, on the face of the documents titled “Return of Allotment of Shares” dated 1 November 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and 14 August 2013<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011 and 10,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 7 August 2013. The documents indicated that there were further cash payments made to acquire those shares. However, there was no evidence that C1 had put up any further cash payments toward those shares, such that any shares from further allotments should be attributed to him too. While the Defendant suggested that C1 had a 25% interest in the company’s profit and returns, and that a portion of such profits was reinvested over the years, I noted that there was no evidence of C1 receiving any corresponding share of dividends or profits over the years. There was also no evidence proving this arrangement or showing C1’s agreement to this arrangement. The affidavits filed by C1 also did not attest to such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Lastly, there was no objective evidence showing what the company’s losses were in 2015 to support how the Defendant arrived at the figure of $29,500. That was simply an estimate that he had decided on his own, with no apparent basis whatsoever.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was also no explanation as to why the sum of $29,500 was only deducted from half of the NAV of the 250,000 shares and was not first deducted from the full NAV before dividing the remainder by two, which would have resulted in a different balance of $165,160.49 instead. This appeared to me to be a contrived attempt at backward reasoning to justify the figure of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I therefore found that the consideration of $150,000 was not commensurate with the value of the shares. This was also the finding arrived at by the Plaintiff’s Valuers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The fact that the Defendant accepted this amount, which was much lower than its NAV, and which was derived at without any coherent method of calculation, suggested that the transaction might not have been done at arm’s length. I noted that the Defendant never explained that he had accepted a consideration of lower value on account of his relationship with C1, though this might have been understandable, and perhaps even reasonable. Rather, the Defendant was constant in his insistence that the transfer had been done at fair market value. I therefore held the Defendant to this standard in examining the veracity of his claim, and found that he fell short.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Defendant’s explanation for transferring the shares in May 2015 credible?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     To explain his decision to transfer his shares to C1, the Defendant reasoned that around the time of the transfer, the parties’ relationship was strained and that for a prolonged period of time, he “<em>lost sleep due to the Plaintiff’s behaviour at home</em>”. The Defendant felt that with his increasing workload and his struggle with the English language, he was unable to perform his role as a director properly. The Defendant felt stressed and under pressure and therefore decided to resign and transfer his shares on 19 May 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     These did not strike me as very compelling reasons for disposing of his shares at the time that he did. Company X had been operating since 2009 and had been profitable over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It did not seem to me that the Defendant’s deficiencies with the English language, if any, had been a hindrance to him conducting his business effectively, and it seemed odd that he would see this as a challenge after six years of operating the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Furthermore, these operational burdens would have arisen from his role as a director, not a shareholder. The Defendant could have simply resigned from his role as director, without having to give up his shares. Rather, the opposite happened, as he sold his shares but had to remain as director for another three years or so. This would have done little to relieve him of the burdens he supposedly felt about the job. It also did not make sense to me that he found his ownership of his shares so stressful, yet so readily passed this apparent ‘poison chalice’ on to his son, without harbouring any similar concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Apart from an allusion to the business being a private company, there was no actual explanation as to why the Defendant decided to sell his shares to C1, and not anyone else. There was no evidence that this sale was something he had been considering for some time, nor was there any evidence of any attempt to sell these shares at a higher value to A or to another third party. I noted that the Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff of the transfer of the shares in Company X, and that the Plaintiff only found out on her own much later. If this was a legitimate arrangement with nothing untoward about it, there was no reason for him to have kept the Plaintiff in the dark this whole time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In light of the above, I did not find the Defendant’s reasons to be credible, particularly in the context of the state of the parties’ relationship at the time. The Defendant’s explanation did not resolve my suspicions, but conversely raised further doubts about the transaction, and gave a sense that the Defendant was obfuscating the truth. I therefore found that that the transfer of shares was, on the balance of probabilities, done with the intention of keeping them beyond the Plaintiff’s reach and depleting the pool of matrimonial assets, particularly given the lack of trust between the parties at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 3: The amount that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets to account for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having decided that the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, it remained for me to determine the notional value to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets. In this regard, I considered the operative date for determining the value of the shares that were dissipated, and whether the full value of these shares as at said operative date should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">What is the operative date for determining the value of the dissipated shares?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Plaintiff’s position was that the value of 250,000 shares in Company X should added to the pool of matrimonial assets at their <em>present value</em>. To this end, the Plaintiff argued that the 250,000 shares should be valued at $1,930,000, being what the Plaintiff’s Valuers found to be their value as at 31 January 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I noted that 31 January 2023 was a date prior to the interim judgment but was nevertheless the latest available valuation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Without going into the correctness of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Valuation Report, I did not agree with the Plaintiff’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Plaintiff’s position was premised on the trite proposition that matrimonial assets are generally valued at the date of the ancillary matters hearing, or as close to the date as possible. However, the court retains the discretion to depart from this where warranted on the facts and where there are cogent reasons to do so (see <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [42] and [43]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, it was not the shares that were being added back into the pool of matrimonial assets, but the <em>notional value</em> of those shares <em>to account for the Defendant’s dissipation</em>. An addition of any amount to the pool of matrimonial assets would have been by virtue of an exercise of discretion to correct the wrongful dissipation, and not by virtue of the Defendant’s ownership of the shares. Accordingly, I was of the view that it was the value of the shares <em>as at the time of dissipation</em> that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, not the latest value of the shares as though they had remained an asset in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As at the time of the hearing, C1 was the legal and beneficial owner of the shares. There was no evidence that C1 held these shares on trust for the Defendant. It would have been artificial and unduly prejudicial to the Defendant to adopt the latest value of the shares. It is anyone’s guess how Company X would have grown over the years had the Defendant remained a 50% shareholder of the company rather than C1, bearing in mind that shareholders are entitled to vote at meetings and thereby influence the company’s business decisions too. It is not the court’s place to dabble in such speculation, and it would be unfair on the Defendant to hold him to such speculative value where he has had no entitlement to any such gain in value from 2015 to 2023. If the reverse occurred and the value of the shares decreased significantly, or if the company had ceased its operation completely, it may be unfair on the Plaintiff if <em>nothing</em> was added back to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, where the shares were of considerable value at the time of dissipation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any case, I found that it would be onerous on the Defendant to add the full value proposed by the Plaintiff, which would have been close to double what I had found to be the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets. As there was no evidence that the Defendant had any interest in the shares since 19 May 2015, and similarly no evidence that he received any dividends from the company that had flowed from such interest since then, the Defendant would not have been able to tap on any commensurate gains in the shares over the years. This would have been prejudicial to his ability to satisfy any division order made. I did not think that this would have led to an equitable outcome in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It remains to be said that one of the key reasons that led to my finding of dissipation was that the transfer of shares to C1 was done at an undervalue. If the consideration paid was not $150,000, but closer to its NAV instead, I might not have found the transaction to amount to a dissipation but rather a mere liquidation of assets, and consequently might not have decided to add the value of the shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I therefore found on the justice of the case that adopting the value of the shares as at the time of dissipation, <em>i.e.</em> in May 2015, would be sufficient to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, whereas it would have been excessive to adopt the latest value of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the full value of the Defendant’s 250,000 shares be added to the pool?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a starting point to compute the value of the shares to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, I found it appropriate to adopt the NAV as declared in the IRAS Working Sheet, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     As mentioned above, there was no evidence that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable. On the face of the IRAS Working Sheet, the NAV of the shares transferred was calculated by deducting the value of the company’s total assets less the value of its total liabilities as declared as at 31 January 2015, divided by two (as the Defendant held 250,000 out of 500,000 shares). Given the dearth of information available as to the company’s finances at the time, the Plaintiff’s Valuers found the NAV method to be the only viable option to determine an estimate of the company’s minimum value.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I noted that the Plaintiff had previously issued a summons for discovery of, among other things, financial documents for the financial years ending 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016, but subsequently withdrew her application. Nevertheless, the financial statements for Company X for the financial years ending 31 January 2017 and 31 January 2018 were in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> These statements contained information relating to the company’s net assets for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Based on these statements, the total net assets for these years were respectively valued at $646,539, $531,480, and $523,568. Each of these values were lower than the NAV accepted for the financial year ending 31 January 2015. This suggested to me that the NAV of $719,641.96 (for all 500,000 shares) might not have been too far off, and was certainly not unrealistically low as a representation of the value of the shares as at May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The question that remained was whether I should simply add the full NAV of the dissipated shares, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98, back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this regard, I found that of the total of 250,000 shares, 75,000 were acquired before the marriage. This was evident from the Return of Allotment of Shares lodged on 1 November 2011, which showed that 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011, bringing his total shareholding at the time to 150,000 shares. There was no suggestion that any further shares were acquired between the date of the parties’ marriage (2 October 2011) and 26 October 2011. The likely inference was therefore that the Defendant had acquired 75,000 shares prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my assessment, these shares had not been converted into a matrimonial asset by way of either party having “<em>ordinarily used or enjoyed</em>” the shares, per Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), as I did not find that the Defendant working for the company and using any income received from this company toward family expenses to constitute ‘usage’ or ‘enjoyment’. There was also no suggestion that these shares were “<em>substantially improved</em>” on by the Plaintiff, per Section 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I also did not accept the ‘commingling’ argument run by the Plaintiff. Unlike monies in a bank account, I found that the shares were distinct and separately identifiable, and that there would be no issues tracing and separating the pre-marital shares from those acquired after the marriage. That there might have been some commingling of the <em>dividends</em> received by the Defendant only went so far as to suggest that the <em>dividends</em> might constitute matrimonial assets, but this was not the issue before me. I therefore found that the corresponding value of these 75,000 shares retained their character as pre-marital assets and should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The NAV of the remaining 175,000 was therefore $251,874.686. Of this amount, I found that the sum of $150,000, being the amount paid by C1 to the Defendant as consideration for the transfer of the shares in Company X, should be deducted from the notional value to be added back to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This sum of $150,000 was evidenced by an image of a cheque issued by Company Y,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> which was a sole proprietorship registered by C1 on 15 May 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff argued that it was incredible that C1 had the sum of $150,000 in his possession at the time. However, in my view, that it was equally unlikely that C1 would register a business if he had no such enterprise going on at the time, and that it was similarly unlikely for the Defendant and the C1 to have hatched a scheme register this business as a ruse just to execute this dissipation, given that Company Y was incorporated nearly a year prior to the transfer of shares on 19 May 2015. The Plaintiff did not further pursue her application for discovery against C1 and did not provide any concrete evidence to indicate that the monies were not C1’s, or that there were no monies paid out by C1 to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     While there were no documents showing the Defendant’s receipt of this sum, the Defendant had explained that he was unable to retrieve the relevant bank account statements, given the passage of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff did not pursue this matter in any application for discovery, and did not specifically question or dispute the receipt of this sum in her affidavit or in her submissions. In these premises, I found on the balance of probabilities that the Defendant had indeed received this sum of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Consequently, I found that the sum of $150,000 should be deducted from the NAV of 175,000 shares ($251,874.686). I therefore decided to notionally add back into the pool of matrimonial assets the balance sum of $101,874.69.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For the reasons set out above, I ultimately found that adding the sum of $101,874.69 back into the pool of matrimonial assets was the most appropriate and equitable redress for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation of his shares in Company X in May 2015.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 147 of the Defendant’s Voluntary Affidavit filed on 13 November 2023 (“DA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 82 to 83 of the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“DAM2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Page 152 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Pages 296 and 297 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit in support of FC/SUM 482/2024, filed on 21 February 2025 (“PA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 584 and 585 of PA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 14 of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“PVA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 50 of the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 9 June 2023;

FC/SUM 587/2024 (“SUM 587”), the defendant-father (“Father”), seeks <em>inter alia</em> the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that he be granted regular weekly access to the parties’ 2 children, [M] and [E] (collectively, the “Children”) from Thursdays 5.00pm to Sundays, 9.00am;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that he be granted access to the Children for half of their mid-year and end-year holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     various other orders relating to public holiday access and overseas travel arrangements for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In essence, the Father’s case is that he should be entitled to 50% (or an equal “split”) of the Children’s time. That broadly reflects what he is seeking through SUM 587. His counsel submits that even as early as October 2023 (before divorce proceedings were actually commenced), both parents had an understanding that they should have equal time with the Children, and that there were no safety and/or other concerns which justifies any deviation from this understanding.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Plaintiff-mother (“Mother”) challenges the Father’s application. The Mother’s position is that she is already providing access to the Father and that these arrangements should continue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Mother – through her counsel – argues that the current arrangement already reflects, broadly, a 50/50 split of the Children’s available time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       To complete the picture of the applicable procedural posture, SUM 587 is an interlocutory application filed in FC/D 5772/2023, which are the ongoing divorce proceedings between the same parties. These divorce proceedings remain pending as both parties having filed a claim and a counterclaim praying for a divorce to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given the various allegations raised by the parties, including the Mother’s concerns with possible use of illicit drugs and the Father’s ability to care for the Children, I found it useful for a Custody/Access Evaluation Report (“Report”) to be prepared by the appointed agency to assist the Court in making the determination on the appropriate access arrangements for the Children. I therefore gave the relevant directions at the first hearing of SUM 587 in October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       For the interim period (pending the final disposal of SUM 587), I also made various orders on 9 October 2024 to provide for a more structured and clear access plan for the Father so that both parties and the Children are clear as to when they would see the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Report has since been prepared in February 2025 and I have considered its contents in deciding the appropriate access arrangements to be made in SUM 587. I delivered my brief decision, in writing, to the parties in March 2025, pursuant to r. 670 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I set out my grounds of decision below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Before I address the substantive orders which I made in the present case, I find it necessary to make several observations as to how the parties (and their counsel) have conducted this matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Arising from the differences in perspectives between the parents, both parties’ arguments and submissions descended into rather technical (and often unnecessary) disputes. These arguments tended to obfuscate more than they illuminate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For example, the parties argued over whether they had in fact adhered to the alleged understanding where the Father would be given an equal split of the Children’s time. The Father says that he should be given half of all available time whereas the Mother believes that only the Children’s “free” time (which excludes the Children’s “down-time”, activity time, etc.) should be divided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, these arguments are unduly technical and borders on inane. Arguing over whether extra-curricular or activity time should be included misses the larger point which is that the <em>purpose</em> of access time is to enable the access (or visiting) parent to build a bond and establish a relationship with his or her child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Thus, fighting over whether which parent should have parenting time during the hours when a school-going child is in school (or engaged in school activities) may well be a fight over who should be standing outside a school or classroom to await their dismissal. It is an unnecessary, and ultimately pointless, fight. On the other hand, if one becomes overly prescriptive, attempting to carve out every possible “activity” time (or impose requirements as to when and where a child should eat, sleep or play) to incorporate as part of an access order, the ensuing order becomes one where the Court would be effectively carving a child’s life up into blocks of hours and minutes. Such an overly prescriptive access order (which <em>is</em> an enforceable and binding court order) unduly restricts <em>both</em> the parents’ and the children’s lives. It also misses the forest for the trees as the true purpose of an access order is to allow one parent to maintain regular contact with the Children: see <em>BG v BF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0233.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 233</a> at [11].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Ultimately, it is incumbent on the parents – being the adults – to act in a practical, sensible and fair manner to ensure that the Children spend sufficient time with <em>both</em> of them and to allow the Children to enjoy the love and attention which both parents want to give.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This leads me to the next, and equally important point – the law places an expectation that each parent endeavour to be the bigger and kinder parent for their child. This, as the High Court (Family Division) in <em>VDX v VDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25522-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 2</a> (at [42]) had observed, means that parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">should strive hard not to mire the family, including the children, in litigation, nor should their resources and the court’s resources be spent on litigation to deal with an emotionally-driven conflict. This will involve some measure of compromise; it may involve being bigger, wiser and kinder – which must be difficult when relationship have broken down, yet this is the legal responsibility placed on all parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the present case, it was apparent from the parties’ affidavits and submissions that there are serious trust issues between both parents. This, however, should not be a reason for them to engage in arguments which appeals to emotions rather than facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To illustrate, the Mother advanced arguments about the alleged danger which the Father might pose to the Children. While some concerns may arise from her genuinely held beliefs, many were wholly speculative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For example, unfortunate arguments revolving the possible use of firearms and/or exposure to gun violence were made by the Mother, through her counsel. The picture which counsel sought to paint was one where the Father is a dangerous gun owner in the United States of America (“US”) – where he grew up with his adoptive family – and that he poses a security risk to the Children given the prevalence of gun-related violence or the accidental discharge of firearms in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Indeed, during oral submissions, the Father was alleged to have engaged in some form of linguistic sophistry when he stated in his affidavit that “[he does] <em>not currently own and/or possess any guns in the US</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Court was then urged to interpret his statement as a tacit acknowledgment that he may own firearms “elsewhere” in the world.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Respectfully, these claims were largely hyperbole and not based on any actual, tangible or even admissible evidence. The Mother did not provide any proof of the Father’s alleged gun ownership. Moreover, I accept the Defendant’s counsel’s submission that to “investigate” into the matter would be to pit father against daughter as the Mother’s entire basis for raising this alleged concern arose from what were clearly hearsay statements allegedly made by 7-year-old [M] in passing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     That is not conducive to effective co-parenting nor is that reflective of a Therapeutic Justice (“TJ”) mindset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Another example relates to the Father’s alleged consumption of drug substances in the US (where the Father submits is a lawful act). Once again, the Mother attempted to paint the Father as a substance abuser who may put the Children at risk. Yet, there is no tangible evidence that the Father consumed illicit drugs in the Children’s presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     These allegations led to various exchanges between counsel, during the hearing of SUM 587, on politically sensitive (and divisive) issues such as gun ownership, drug abuse and the apparent clash of Western and Asian cultures or values. These exchanges similarly shed little light on the actual issue at hand, <em>viz.</em> what should be the appropriate access orders <em>in this case</em> for <em>this family</em> now that the Children are living in Singapore (a place where neither guns nor recreational drugs are allowed).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As the parties continue along their journey through their ongoing divorce proceedings, I encourage both of them and their counsel to avoid making broad or sweeping allegations against one another. The High Court (Family Division) in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (at [26] – [28]) reminds us that an adversarial approach (instead of a problem-solving one) undermines TJ, and that a TJ system “<em>involves parties making what they may perceive to be ‘sacrifices’ – letting go of what has hurt them deeply, refraining from doing ‘inflammatory’ acts against the other party, compromising by giving in and co-operating with the other party in some issues, taking responsibility where required and finding the will to recast the future.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Speaking extra-judicially, Justice Teh Hwee Hwee (in delivering Her Honour’s keynote address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 at the Family Conference 2024) noted that TJ has been explicitly adopted by the Singapore courts and that “[o]<em>ur family justice system aims to help parties and their children heal, enabling them to move forward with their lives despite the breakdown of the marital relationship. </em><b><em>It is a non-adversarial, problem-solving system that allows time for grieving and supports healing, restoration, and the recasting of a positive future</em></b>. [Emphasis added]”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     More recently, the Family Justice Courts (“FJC”) have launched the <em>Family Justice Courts Therapeutic Justice Model</em> (“TJ Model”) in October 2024. The TJ Model, read in conjunction with the FJC’s Practice Directions 2024, requires parties to court proceedings (and their lawyers) to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the principles set out therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Part 3 of the TJ Model reminds parties that they “<em>play a central role in the TJ Model. They are to take ownership of the family’s issues and cooperate with each other to find timely and enduring solutions to these issues. Particularly where children are involved, they are to prioritise the welfare of the children above their own and focus on parties’ shared interests and future. This involves being willing to compromise in the spirit of give and take and carrying out agreed or ordered arrangements with a cooperative spirit</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Parties are therefore expected to “[a]<em>dopt a cooperative and constructive approach to find timely and enduring solutions; and resolve disputes as amicably as possible</em>” and “[u]<em>se respectful and constructive language in correspondence, court documents and courtroom communications</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     These principles should be borne in the parties’ minds as they navigate their divorce and, more importantly, when implementing the access orders made by the Court in the present application, or in the eventual ancillary matters orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I now move on to the substantive issue – <em>ie.</em> what access orders should be made in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is trite law that when making orders in respect of the custody or the upbringing of children, the Court’s first and <em>paramount</em> consideration is that of the children’s welfare. That is clearly set out in s 125(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal in <em>BNS v BNT</em> [2015] 3 SLR 373 (at [19]) emphasised that this principle ought to override any other consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     When considering what is in a child’s welfare (which ought to be understood in the widest sense),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> regard may be had to the various factors including <em>inter alia</em>, the need for stability, continuity of living arrangements, the need for both parents’ to be involved in a child’s life, the maternal bond, and the desirability of keeping siblings together: see <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (at [20] – [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I wish to make two more observations in relation to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     First, SUM 587 is framed as an application for access orders <em>only</em> and thus it is not necessary for the Court to make orders for the Children’s care and control. That said, it is clear that the Mother currently has <em>de facto</em> care and control of the Children. This is a state of affairs which I find to be appropriate for the Children at present, and nothing in my order should be taken as changing this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Second, a significant part of the Father’s case rests on the existence of an alleged Contact Time Agreement (or “CTA”) where parties had “<em>entered</em>” into in or around 19 October 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father submits that this CTA grants him the unequivocal right to have an equal split of the Children’s total time, which the Mother disagrees with, thus giving rise to the dispute referred to at [10] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     While the CTA may be relevant as an expression of one or both parties’ broad intent on the issue of custody and access, it is by no means determinative or dispositive. Section 129 of the WC expressly states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreement for custody, etc.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">129.  The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the custody, or the care and control, of a child, regardless when the agreement was made, despite any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The purport of this provision is clear – while parents may agree to how a child should be cared for, it is the child’s welfare which should be paramount. Where the terms of the agreement may no longer be suitable, the Court retains the discretion to make the appropriate orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Moreover, insofar as the Father seeks to argue that the CTA is clear with regard to how the Children’s access time should be apportioned between both parents, I do not agree with his submission. In my view, the CTA – which was, in truth, an exchange of text messages between the parents about the impending divorce – was less of a definitive agreement but a generalised idea of what the Father wanted if the Mother proceeds with divorce proceedings, to which the Mother broadly acknowledged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Ultimately, the Court must have regard to the overall circumstances of the case when deciding the appropriate access orders for the Children, and that includes the contents of the Report which was prepared (and which I found to be highly relevant).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     As the Court of Appeal had observed in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<em>WKM</em>”) at [74]: “[i]<em>n the process of generating their reports, the professionals would have engaged directly with the relevant persons involved in the child’s life and observed some of their interactions with the child. </em><b><em>Their observations serve as crucial insights into the child’s world and greatly assist the court by presenting the realities of the child’s situation</em></b><em>. Given their expertise, they are well suited to identify issues, such as excessive gatekeeping behaviour by the parents and even possible signs of abuse</em>…[Emphasis added]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In the present case, the evaluator had the opportunity to speak with the [M]’s primary school teacher, [M]’s psychologist, and [E]’s preschool principal as well as both parents and the Children. These interactions provided invaluable insights which were immensely relevant and helpful to the Court’s determination of the disputed access issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The evaluator’s observations are consistent with my findings on the evidence presented to the Court through the parties’ affidavits, including <em>inter alia</em> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother has been the children’s primary caregiver and can continue in this role with the support network she has in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> She continues to be the Children’s care parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Although the Father’s private life (including concerns about possible recreational drug use overseas) may have form a central aspect of the Mother’s worries,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I do not find that his private life has affected his ability to provide care for the Children <em>in Singapore</em>. For example, the Mother has not provided any evidence that the Father had engaged in recreational drug use which rendered him in a stupefied state or have caused him to act in a manner which rendered him a danger to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Both Children are bright, intelligent, and are performing well in school. Both siblings share a close bond and relationship, and I find it desirable and important that both sister and brother continue to provide support for each other, wherever possible, including when they are with the Father during his access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also find that the Children share a good relationship with <em>both</em> parents despite the trying time for the family, and that this is heartening. Efforts should continue to be made to ensure that the Children’s relationship with both parents remain strong post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     With these broad observations and findings in mind, I set out below my specific orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Pending the full and final disposal of ancillary matters in respect of FC/D 5772/2023 (including any appeals in relation thereto), the Defendant shall have access to the Children as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>School Term Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>During [M]’s school term, the Defendant shall have access every Thursday, from 5.30pm to 8.30pm.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>The Defendant shall have overnight access as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>For the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> week of every month, the Defendant shall have overnight access from Friday, 5.30pm to Saturday 6pm;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>For the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> week of every month, the Defendant shall have overnight access from Friday, 5.30pm to Sunday 10am.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>School Holiday Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>During [M]’s primary school holiday period in March and September each year, the Defendant shall have access to the Children:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>for the second half of the holiday period from 12 noon on Thursday to 6pm on Saturday for the school holiday in March; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>for the first half of the school holiday period from 6 pm on Saturday to 12 noon on Thursday for the school holiday in September.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>For [M]’s June and December school holidays, the Defendant shall have access to both the Children for the first half of school holidays on odd numbered years (eg. 2025, 2027, 2029) and the second half of the school holidays on even numbered years (eg. 2026, 2028, etc.) (“Holiday Access Period”).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>e</em>)     <em>During the Holiday Access Period:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>the Defendant shall have overnight access from 9am every Thursday to 9am on Sunday; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>regular (non-overnight access) on Mondays to Wednesdays, from 9am to 7.30pm.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iii</em>)    <em>The Defendant shall not bring the Children overseas during the Holiday Access Period unless the Plaintiff consents to the said travel arrangements, or by Order of Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em><u>Public Holiday Access</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>f</em>)     <em>The Defendant shall have access to the Children on gazetted public holidays or special holidays/events as follows:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>i</em>)     <em>For the holiday known as “Thanksgiving” celebrated in the United States of America, the Defendant shall have access to the Children from 9am to 7pm on the eve, and actual day, of the Thanksgiving holiday with the Defendant.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>ii</em>)    <em>For the Chinese New Year (“CNY”) holiday period (as celebrated in Singapore), the Children would spend the eve and CNY Day 1 with the Plaintiff.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iii</em>)    <em>The Defendant shall have access to the Children from 9am to 7.30pm on :</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(<em>A</em>)     <em>Christmas eve every odd-numbered year (eg. 2025, 2027, 2029); and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(<em>B</em>)     <em>Christmas day on even-numbered years (eg. 2026, 2028, etc.).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>iv</em>)    <em>Save as set out above, the Defendant shall have access to the Children on alternate gazetted public holidays from 9 am to 7.30pm.

To be clear, and as set out above,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I make this order <em>not</em> because I find the Father to be a security threat to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Rather, save for a single trip to the US with [M] a few years ago, the evidence suggests that the Father has not travelled with the Children alone. As I have found it in the Children’s best interests for both sister and brother to be together during access (where possible), extended periods of overseas travel with <em>both</em> Children should be a matter which both parents should continue to discuss and consider as they move on with the present proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I should add that any such further travel arrangements should take into account the Children’s readiness for extended travel and the Father’s plans as to how care would be provided to them. In so doing, the views of [M] and/or her psychologist should also be considered, where appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     As for the regular access arrangements, in making these orders, I have – where possible provided the Father with a significant amount access time to provide the Children ample opportunity to bond with their father. I have also considered what both parents had informed the evaluator as being their proposed access plans, including weekly and public holiday access hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In some cases, such as the Children’s school holidays and public holidays, I have provided for the Father to have about half of the relevant access period (in terms of calendar days or months). This is not because I am enforcing the terms of the so-called CTA (as put forward by the Father and his counsel) nor is a 50/50 split some default position used by the Court. Rather, it is a recognition that where the Children’s time and schedule permits, it is in their interest to spend quality time with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I wish to reinforce one point – just as I had reminded the Mother not to descend into the minutiae of the Children’s schedule or the allocation of their “free time”, the Father should not be overly fixated with there being some form of overarching concept of “fairness” mandating a 50/50 split in the Children’s time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Father seeks to highlight how the Mother had sought to “commoditised” the Children’s time by requiring make-up time, or extra hours with the Children as something to be traded and/or negotiated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> However, splitting the Children’s time and/or schedule mechanistically to achieve an “equal” division will invariably result in the same commoditisation of the Children’s lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I thus encourage the Father to use the access time he has with the Children (which is generous) in a manner which builds their relationship through father-child activities and interactions. As I had noted above, there is no real purpose of having an allocated “access” time where the parent is merely engaged in passive acts, such as waiting. The focus should be on <em>quality</em>, not quantity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In a similar vein, I note that both [E] and [M] have additional classes and activities over their regular school curriculum. These may sometimes affect how much quality time each parent has, and an overly mechanistic allocation may affect the Children. For example, the Children’s Chinese and/or tennis class schedule have resulted in some challenges with the Father’s pick-up and return schedules. These are matters which the Mother should look into to ascertain what would be the most practical way to allow the Children more quality time with the Father while not overburdening their rest time. However, I will not be making orders to prescribe a certain schedule. These are parenting matters best left to the parents to work together and resolve.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In the circumstances, I will not be ordering any change to the Children’s current <em>de facto</em> care arrangements, and have provided for a more comprehensive interim access arrangement for the Father to see the Children while the divorce proceedings are underway.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     To support the parties’ healing and to assist them to navigate their journey to co-parent the Children, I encourage them to continue to see their psychologist, Ms [S], to work on their mutual co-parenting skills and support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     After considering the parties’ costs submissions, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions dd 27.09.24 (“DS”) at [26]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dd 27.09.24 (“PS”) at [15] and [18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>PS at [20]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>DA2 at [36]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>PA1 at 9b</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>TJ Model at [9(a)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>TJ Model at [13]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>DS at [16]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>See <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/49688-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 135</a>;

The mother is a foreigner on a long-term visit pass (“<b>LTVP</b>”) in Singapore. The pass will expire soon, and it is unclear whether it will be renewed by the authorities. Are such factors conclusive in showing that the Singaporean father ought to have sole care and control of the child? This issue – which has thus far eluded judicial comment – arose in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a Singaporean (“<b>Husband</b>”). The Defendant is a Filipino on LTVP in Singapore (“<b>Wife</b>”). They were married in June 2011 and have a 10-year-old son (D.O.B. XX September 2014) (“<b>Son</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After 12 years of marriage, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in June 2023.

This requires me to consider which parent can better (a) attend to the child’s emotional, developmental, and material needs, (b) provide for his daily care, and (c) make day-to-day decisions for him: see e.g., <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In making such a determination, courts have generally considered the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>The parents’ past and present interactions with the child</em>. For instance, which parent has shown greater concern, interest and responsibility for the child? Which parent has been the child’s primary caregiver? Which parent has a stronger bond with the child? See <em>XDZ</em> at [14(a)] to [14(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>The parents’ future caregiving arrangements</em>. For instance, which parent can provide better care for the child? Which parent can provide a more secure and stable home environment for the child? Which parent is more willing to promote a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent? What are the child’s wishes? See <em>XDZ</em> at [14(e)] to [14(g)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Adverse considerations</em>. For instance, does any of the parent have an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook which may affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child? Has any of the parent acted in a way to intentionally or knowingly harm the child’s interest? See <em>XDZ</em> at [15].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Other considerations.</em> When making orders of care and control, courts are mindful, for instance, that the continuity of the child’s living arrangements is an important factor for his/her emotional well-being. Courts are also slow to separate siblings from one another.

Her LTVP expires on 2 April 2025 (i.e., about two weeks after this judgement). It is unclear whether she can renew her LTVP thereafter. This is because she needs a Singapore citizen or permanent resident to sponsor her LTVP renewal application. The evidence suggests that the Husband is unwilling to continue to be her sponsor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     If her LTVP is not renewed, the Wife will have to leave Singapore. This can lead to (a) application by the Wife to relocate the Son overseas (so as to be with her) and (b) application by the Husband for the child to remain in Singapore and be placed under his care instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Does uncertainty regarding the renewal of the Wife’s LTVP, as well as the possibility that she may denied continued stay in Singapore, mean that sole care and control of the Son must be awarded to the Husband? In my view, the answer is no. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In deciding in whose care and control the Son should be placed, the <em>paramount consideration is his welfare</em>: s 125 Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Wife will be allowed to remain in Singapore is a relevant factor in deciding whether she should have care and control of the Son. This is because it goes towards the issue of whether she can provide a continuity of his living arrangements in the long term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That said, it is settled law that the continuity of a child’s living arrangements is <em>just one of the many factors</em> that must be considered on the issue of care and control. A court must <em>consider and balance all</em> the relevant factors: <em>XDZ</em> at [14] to [16]. If the <em>mere possibility</em> that the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“<b>ICA</b>”) may not renew the Wife’s LTVP means that care and control of the Son must be awarded to the Husband, this is tantamount to (i) placing undue weight to the continuity factor and (ii) rendering the other factors in [9] and [10] above redundant when deciding on care and control issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, I agree with the Wife that it will be wrong in principle for me to let ICA’s decision (on whether to renew the Wife’s LTVP) dictate my decision on which parent should have care and control of the Son. This is because the ICA decision is based on immigration policy considerations, whereas my decision is to be based solely on the Son’s welfare and interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To be clear – the foregoing should not be understood to mean that the non-renewal of a parent’s LTVP is an irrelevant consideration altogether: see [14(b)] above. Rather, the issue is what <em>weight</em> ought to be placed on this factor. In this regard, much depends on the circumstances of each case. For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If the factors in [9] are finely balanced, then the possibility that the LTVP may not be renewed can tip the balance in favor of awarding care and control to the Singaporean parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, a child’s <em>age</em> – e.g., whether it is (i) a baby, (ii) schooling, (iii) approaching the age for national service enlistment (in the case of males), <em>or</em> (iv) on the cusp of adulthood – can also affect the weight to be placed on the possibility that a parent’s LTVP may not be renewed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I am mindful that the scenarios in [13] above can be severely disruptive for the Son. In my view, this does not displace the clear evidence that the Wife is better able (than the Husband) to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Son is still young – only about 10 years’ age – and in his formative years. The Wife (i) has been his primary caregiver since birth, (ii) shares a stronger bond with him, and (iii) is a more caring parent: see [10(a)] to [10(d)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Son is placed in the Husband’s care and control, the child is likely to have a difficult time bonding with his father (given the latter’s work routine and their wide age gap). The Son may also end up feeling like an “abandoned child” if he were passed around from relative to relative to be looked after when the Husband is not free to take care of him. (I note that the Husband did not designate any particular relative who will be responsible for helping to look after the Son if the need arises.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For completeness, I wish to address one other point. The Husband has submitted that the Wife is seeking care and control of the Son for an ulterior motive – to remain in Singapore. I am unable to accept this submission. The Wife’s life will not be easy if she remains in Singapore and have to look after the Son. This is because she will effectively be a single mother who must juggle between (a) caring for her growing child and (b) holding a full-time job. She will probably be doing this without a helper’s assistance: see [10(d)(iii)] above. This hardship will persist for a long time – as it will be a decade before the Son reaches adulthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     After considering all the factors wholistically, I decide to award the Wife sole care and control of the Son.

(emphasis added) It is clear from this definition that so long as a property is acquired by a spouse during marriage, it is “matrimonial asset”. This so even if the property is “solely owned and paid for” by one spouse: <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [34]; <em>BPC v BPB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [49] and [52].

This is because (i) a substantial portion of them came from 33 years of CPF contributions which he had made <em>before</em> marriage (since 1978 when he started working at age 20), and (ii) the contributions that he had made <em>during</em> the marriage form only a small portion of these funds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife submitted that the CPF funds should be included in the matrimonial pool. According to her, the Husband had failed to prove how much of these funds were contributed before and after marriage. In the circumstances, it would be pure speculation for him to claim that all the funds were acquired before marriage. Furthermore, in accordance with CPF’s usual policy, the Husband would have used up <em>all</em> the funds in his Ordinary Account when he paid for the Flat. This means that the funds currently in this account must have been acquired after such payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     My findings are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I accept the Wife’s submission (i) that the Husband has the burden of proof, and (ii) that he is likely to have used up most of the funds in his Ordinary Account to pay for the Flat’s downpayment ($59,200). I would add that the Husband is also likely to have thereafter used the monthly contributions into his Ordinary Account to settle the Flat’s monthly mortgage payments. This means that the funds currently in his Ordinary Account – $145.75 – is likely to have been acquired <em>after</em> the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for the funds in the other accounts, i.e., the Medisave Account, Special Account, and Retirement Account, I find that most of them are likely to have come from contributions that the Husband had made <em>before</em> the marriage. This is because the circumstances in which funds may be withdrawn from these accounts are very limited. In other words, the CPF contributions which the Husband had made since the start of his working life (in 1978) are likely to have remained largely intact in these accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I note that the Husband has been working for about 45 years as of 2023 (when the marriage ended). Of this period, he was married for about 12 years (i.e., about ¼ of his working life).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Taking a broadbrush approach, I find that ¼ of the CPF funds in [24(e)] should be added to the matrimonial pool. This amount comes to <b>$30,704.17.</b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Funds in the Husband’s POSB account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Next, I turn to the funds in the Husband’s POSB account ($10,602.37).

As this was done without the leave of the court, I placed no weight on the contents of the letters in reaching my decision. It is important for counsel to bear in mind the observations of the courts in <em>VYP v VYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26994-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 40</a> (at [36]) and <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a> (at [9]) on the proper conduct of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     That said, I noted from M/s Mirchandani &amp; Partners’ letter dated 4 December 2024 that the Mother’s application for a Long-Term Visit Pass (“LTVP”) had been rejected by the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”). As this was a development that could materially affect the care arrangement for the children, I directed the CER dated 2 December 2024 to be updated so that the evidence could be properly received and considered. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a> (at [36]) and reiterated in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (at [73]), welfare reports are admissible even if they may contain a certain amount of hearsay. Having received the updated CER on 30 December 2024, I rendered my decision on 24 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Although parties had made submissions on care and control before relocation, I was of the view that the primary issue that had to be decided first was relocation. In my brief grounds, I referred parties to <em>XBF v XBE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32437-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 42</a> where Choo Han Teck J noted (at [6]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This case is not as straightforward as it appears. The finding that the Respondent was the primary caregiver is challenged, not without grounds, by the Appellant. The DJ, however, conflated the idea that a relocation order follows care and control because it is in the best interests of the children to be with the primary caregiver. In many cases, that might be correct, but this is not such a case. The primary issue in this case is the relocation of the children, not which parent should be granted care and control. The two issues must be examined together. It cannot be assumed, as the court below did, that relocation follows the issue of care and control. The court should consider whether it is in the best interests for the children to be relocated to Indonesia, and the question of care and control can be determined as part of that inquiry. The best interests of the children may overlap with the best interests of the mother, but they are not the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Likewise, in <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> which concerned cross-appeals involving the care and control and relocation of the parties’ 3-year old child, Debbie Ong J (as she then was) noted (at [4]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I begin with the appeal of the Father in which he sought sole care and control of [G] and for leave to have [G] relocate to India with him. If the appeal against the DJ’s decision refusing relocation is allowed, then the other decisions on shared care and holding of the child’s legal documents will be affected and must be dealt with in that context.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Taking guidance from these cases, I decided that it would be more appropriate to determine the issue of relocation first. I gave careful consideration to the affidavits, submissions and the CER but was unable to find in favour of the Mother. While her wish to relocate to Brisbane was understandable and reasonable, it was incompatible with the interests of the children. Accordingly, I disallowed the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I was mindful that the Mother would likely be very disappointed by my decision. Relocation cases are never easy to decide as they involve a binary decision. Whichever way the court decides, the decision is bound to cause considerable pain and anguish to one of the parties: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (“<em>BNS v BNT</em>”) (at [2]). As noted in <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16951-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 1</a> (“<em>TAA v TAB</em>”) (at [18]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Raising children requires heavy commitment. The law expects no less from parents in post-divorce circumstances. This is not to say that the law does not recognise the difficulties and pain parents may have to bear, but children do grow up and such sacrifice is not demanded endlessly of a parent. Sacrifices may have to be made temporarily in the years when the children require them. The law chooses to place the welfare of the child above all else.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     My decision was not intended to deny the Mother’s wish to return to Brisbane. However, this was an application to relocate the children and a decision on relocation is based ultimately on the welfare of the children. On the facts before me, I did not find that it was in their best interests for the children to relocate at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my brief grounds, I stressed that a refusal to allow relocation at the time of application did not necessarily mean that a future relocation could never be possible: see <em>TAA v TAB</em> (at [20]). When circumstances have changed such that it is clear that relocation is in the best interests of the children, the Mother can always renew her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The parties agreed to have joint custody of the children but disputed care and control. While I was of the view that it would have been in their welfare for the children to continue to spend equal time with each parent should both parents remain living in Singapore, I noted that the Mother’s application for a LTVP had been rejected by the ICA. As such, the current shared care arrangement in Singapore was no longer feasible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the circumstances, I granted the Father care and control of the children with liberal access to the Mother as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Liberal phone and video access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Equal share of school holidays</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Mother is at liberty to bring the children for overseas holidays during her holiday access time with the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Father is to facilitate the children’s liberal overnight access with Mother whenever the Mother visits the children in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In addition to the above orders, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children to continue receiving therapy with Ms [M] or a therapist that is mutually agreed between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Parties may vary the care arrangement by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Additionally, I appointed an experienced parenting coordinator, Ms Anuradha Sharma, to assist the parties with access plans. Taking into consideration the relative financial positions of the parties, I allocated the bulk of the fees for parenting coordination (90%) to be paid by the Father and the remainder (10%) to be paid by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As the Mother has appealed the whole of my decision, I now set out my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Mother’s relocation application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother submitted that her relocation application should be granted.

There is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation where the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is reasonable. Rather, the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is only relevant to the extent that there would be a transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child, since it is the child’s welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (<em>BNS v BNT</em> at [20]; see also <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<em>TAA v TAB</em>”) at [17]). There is no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy amongst the various factors to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare. Where the factors stand in relation to one another depends, finally, on a consideration of all the facts of the case (<em>BNS v BNT</em> at [22]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As noted in the more recent decision of the Family Division in <em>WRU v WRT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31510-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 23</a> (“<em>WRU v WRT</em>”) (at [15]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… factors that the court may have regard to apart from the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver and the child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent include “the child’s age, the child’s attachment to each parent and other significant persons in the child’s life, the child’s wellbeing in her present country of residence, as well as the child’s developmental needs at that particular stage of life, including her cognitive, emotional, academic and physical needs” (<em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (“<em>UXH v UXI</em>”) at [28]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Additionally, the court should also consider the wishes of the children. As noted by Mavis Chionh J in <em>WRU v WRT</em>, “research supports the view it is more often than not beneficial for the parties and the children for the children to be given a voice on arrangements that are made for them”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_109\" id=\"Ftn_109_1\"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> and “greater focus ought to be placed on the child’s wishes and feelings in determining the welfare of the child”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_110\" id=\"Ftn_110_1\"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>. The learned judge also noted that “the question of how much weight is to be attached to the wishes of the child is a matter that falls within the judge’s discretion. Relevant factors that the judge should consider include the age and maturity of the children and the risk that the children may have been coached and pressurised by a parent to express certain views”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_111\" id=\"Ftn_111_1\"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable wishes of primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Joint intention of parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     There was ample evidence to support the Mother’s claim that the parties’ relocation, first to KL, and subsequently to Singapore, was temporary. The evidence showed that there was a joint intention for the family to return to Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     A clear example was an email dated 26 June 2021 from the Father to the maternal grandfather where the Father said so himself that “[w]e did originally plan to go to KL for three years” and that “[l]ong term, we will be living in Australia. I have committed to that.” In the same email, the Father also said that he “need a few more years to save” and the move to Singapore “was a short term solution to the long term aim of being in Australia”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_112\" id=\"Ftn_112_1\"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Another example was a message dated 13 July 2021, prior to the parties’ relocation to Singapore, where the Father assured the Mother that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_113\" id=\"Ftn_113_1\"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 11:03:04 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If at the end of 3 years it’s still no good for you, we go back to Australia in our separate ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     There was also clear evidence that the Mother was reluctant to move to Singapore. This was evident, for example, in the following text messages to the Father dated 11 July 2021 and 13 July 2021:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_114\" id=\"Ftn_114_1\"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 9:05:25 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">So what happens at the end of 3 years?

And then we have to come back and try start again in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 11:27:42 am].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This moving to Singapore is taking me further and further away from being able to get a job, restart life and get the kids settled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 7:58:12 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Before I leave for Singapore I want either cash or bulimba transferred into my name. I’m taking a massive risk here that you are not going to destroy me when I get to Singapore. I can legally keep the kids here now, so if I give you the benefit of the doubt I expect you not to do it to me, country or money wise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[13/7/2021, 7:58:57 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I will be out of the workforce for 10 years, I will be literally starting my career again, for the benefit of yours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The evidence also showed that the Mother was emphatic that she would only be in Singapore for no more than 3 years. For example, in a text message dated 11 July 2021, she told the Father as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_115\" id=\"Ftn_115_1\"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[11/7/2021, 11.28:57 am]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I’m in Singapore for 3 years, no more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In light of the contemporaneous evidence, I was unable to accept the Father’s claim that the Mother wanted to move because she was bored of living in Singapore. In my view, this was not a fair characterisation of the Mother’s reason to relocate. Given the clear evidence on the joint intention of the parties, I found the Mother’s wish to return to her home country to be reasonable and consistent with the parties’ intention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Breakdown in relationship</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was not disputed that by the time the parties relocated to Singapore, their relationship had broken down. The parties lived separately and their relationship continued to deteriorate, with the Father commencing parenting and financial proceedings in Australia followed by the Mother commencing divorce proceedings also in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As observed in <em>UYK v UYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24728-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 9</a> (“<em>UYK v UYJ</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    In the recent decisions where leave to relocate <em>was granted</em>, many of the cases involved a parent returning to his or her home country after the breakdown of the parents’ relationship. On either ground, the Mother’s wish to return to Australia was eminently reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    In <em>UXH</em>, the Court noted that the parties appeared to accept that the case did not involve a spouse who has no significant connection to the forum country after the divorce, feels or is isolated, and wishes to return to his or her home country (usually the country in which he or she grew up and where the extended family remains). Some lawyers have referred to this factual matrix as a case of a “trailing spouse”. In such cases, depending on the precise facts, appropriate weight may be accorded to the possibility that denying the parent’s wish to relocate may so deeply affect such a parent’s well-being that this in turn has negative effects on the child (<em>UXH</em> at [16] and <em>BNS</em> ([25] <em>supra</em>) at [20]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In my view, the factual matrix in the present case was not dissimilar to the case of a “trailing spouse” described above. As the parties’ marriage had broken down irretrievably, the Mother’s wish to return to her home country was eminently reasonable, bearing in mind that she had been out of the workforce for a substantial period of time and had to restart her life and career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mother’s visa status</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father said that when his OnePass was issued in December 2023, the Mother refused to collect her Dependent’s Pass, which resulted in the uncertainty over the Mother’s visa status.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_116\" id=\"Ftn_116_1\"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> The Father submitted that the Mother’s refusal to cooperate with the Father was simply to gain an advantage in these proceedings – so that she could submit that her visa was uncertain and that she must be allowed to relocate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I did not find any merit in the Father’s allegation. Notably, the OnePass application was made on 3 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span>, well after the Mother’s relocation application was filed. The grounds of the Mother’s relocation would have crystallised at the point of filing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Moreover, it was difficult to see what tactical advantage would be served by the Mother jeopardising her own visa status. It must be remembered that this was an application for the relocation of the children, and not that of the Mother. The Mother did not require the permission of the court to relocate. The fact that the Mother’s visa status was uncertain did not mean that the relocation of the children would automatically be allowed. The overriding consideration in all relocation cases is the welfare of the child. This was reiterated in <em>BNS v BNT</em> at [19]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… there is <em>only one fundamental</em> – indeed, <em>critical</em> – legal principle upon which everything else (including the ultimate decision of the case itself) depends. And it is this – in considering relocation applications, <em>the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Although much ink was spilled by parties over the Mother’s visa status, it turned out that this consideration did not have a material bearing on the determination of the reasonableness of the Mother’s wish at the end of day. This was because there were sufficient grounds, independent of her visa status, to show that her wish to relocate was not unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No presumption in favour of allowing relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Although the Mother’s wish to relocate was reasonable, I was mindful that there is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation even in such a case. As noted in <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29111-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 28</a> (at [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may still disallow the application even if the relocating parent’s application is not unreasonable and done in bad faith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Hence, a finding of reasonableness was not the end of the inquiry. I had to consider if the Mother’s wish was incompatible with the interests of the children. This is also clear from <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a>, which held (at [11]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… While the wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, the court must determine if those wishes are incompatible with the interests of the child; where they may not be compatible, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own (<em>TAA</em> at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Relevance of shared care arrangement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Additionally, the following observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS v BNT</em> (at [20]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is not relevant <em>per se</em>. It is relevant <em>only to the extent</em> that it is found that there will be a transference of his or her insecurity and negative feelings onto <em>the child</em>. It is, after all, <em>the child’s</em> welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (or either of the parents for that matter).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As noted in <em>WNO v WNP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29869-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 19</a> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where there are two primary caregivers such as the present case, the transference of the insecurity and negative feelings onto the child by the parent who is disappointed that his or her relocation application is not granted is mitigated by the presence of the other caregiving parent. It follows that in such a situation, the wishes of the relocating parent would carry less weight compared to cases where the relocating parent is the sole caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In the present case, the shared care and control arrangement was relevant in assessing the weight to be accorded to the Mother’s wish. To the extent that the transference of the insecurity and negative feelings onto the children by the Mother was mitigated by the presence of the Father, the Mother’s wish to relocate would correspondingly carry lesser weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother’s claim that the shared care arrangement was forced on her appeared to be premised on a belief that her right to the children was superior to that of the Father. She also accused the Father of having “robbed her” of her fulltime care of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> However, such a belief is contrary to the expectations of the law. As noted in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, <b>the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother</b> in respect of such custody, administration or application <b>nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It is abundantly clear from the above provision that neither parent had a greater right to the children. Indeed, the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests: see <em>CX v CY</em> [2005] SLR (R) 690 (at [28]). The parental responsibility to care for a child is coequal (see <em>VWJ v VWI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29354-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 7</a> at [6]) and extends to supporting the child’s relationship with both parents (see <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> at [50]). As noted in <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0187.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 187</a> (at [21]), citing <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR (R) 233, “a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life”. Hence, a parent’s desire to play an active role in the child’s upbringing is to be strongly encouraged and commended. It ought not to be frown upon, as did the Mother in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother seemed averse to the Father playing a coequal role in the care of the children and had even sought to reduce the Father’s parenting time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> While it is common for a relocating parent to ask for sole care and control of the children for practical reasons, the Mother had insisted on sole care and control <em>even if</em> her relocation application was not allowed. I found this troubling, as it revealed a lack of insight on the importance of co-parenting to the well-being of the children. This lack of insight, coupled with her inability to move past personal grudges against the Father and belief that she was the superior parent, suggested that her co-parenting ability might be limited if granted sole care and control in the event of relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In contrast, the Father had consistently recognised the importance of the children maintaining a close relationship with the Mother. He did not seek to reduce the Mother’s parenting time nor did he ask to have sole care and control of the children. In <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a>, Debbie Ong J observed (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parental responsibility is a legal duty to be discharged by both parents. A strong parent is one who can support the child in having a close relationship with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In this regard, the Father was clearly the stronger parent as he was more attuned to the needs of the children in having a close relationship with both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Notwithstanding the claim by the Mother that the shared care arrangement was forced on her and neither in the best interests nor welfare of the children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_121\" id=\"Ftn_121_1\"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> the children did benefit from the shared care arrangement. As noted in <em>WRU v WRT</em> (at [36]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court is predominantly tasked with assessing the merits of the relocation application on the facts as they <em>presently are</em>, as opposed to the state of the relationship in the past (see <em>ULA v UKZ</em> at [50]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the Mother had sought to rake up the past and paint a dismal picture of the Father, it must be remembered that the paramount consideration should be the welfare of the children, and not the past conduct of a parent: see <em>UBQ v UBR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29508-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 10</a> (at [49]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Children’s interests</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Children’s views may be presented in child welfare reports, including specific issues reports, which are prepared by professionals: see <em>WRU v WRT</em> (at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     From the CER, I was very heartened to note that the children shared a close relationship with both parents despite the increasing tensions between the adults due to the relocation. I noted further that both children were cognisant that the Mother had been wanting to return to live in Australia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The younger child enjoyed his holidays in Brisbane with the maternal family and shared extensively about their holiday farmhouse and biking adventures. However, he was concerned about leaving the Father behind, if he were to relocate to Australia with the Mother. He had no opinion whether to remain in Singapore or to relocate and would like to live in a country where he could see both parents frequently and equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The older child expressed worries about living in Australia during winter and being away from his friends. He shared that he had lived in Malaysia and Singapore most of his life and enjoyed living in the city and in the tropics. He hoped to continue living in either Singapore or Malaysia and hoped to continue with the current living arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Our courts have consistently recognised that siblings should not be separated: e.g. see <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> [1991] 1 SLR (R) 680 (at [22(d)]). In <em>WIQ v WIP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29516-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 16</a>, Choo Han Teck J explained the rationale (at [4]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is not usual for split care and control to be ordered. Keeping siblings together should be the norm for the obvious reason that the anxieties arising from their parental separation should not be increased by a further separation of a sibling. Nonetheless, this is just one of many considerations, and the weight to be given to it varies from case to case, each on its own facts: <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> <em>(&quot;ABW&quot;)</em> at [23] and [24]; <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Given the clear wishes of the older child to continue living in Singapore or Malaysia, the neutrality expressed by the younger child and the need to avoid separating the siblings, I found this factor (i.e. children’s wishes) to lean against relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Loss of children’s relationship with the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The loss of relationship a child may experience with the left-behind parent is another important factor in a relocation application. As noted in <em>TAA v TAB</em> (at [19]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A relocation of children to another jurisdiction is a serious matter. It would mean a fundamental change in whom the children would see as their close family and the children would lose the experience of hands-on parenting from both their mother and their father (see <em>K v K</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 793). <b>The court must give sufficient weight to the loss of the children’s relationship with the left-behind parent</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Having regard to the shared care arrangement, the children’s wishes and the close relationship the children shared with the Father, I found that the welfare of the children would be negatively impacted if relocation was allowed. Hence, while I was mindful that the loss of relationship in itself was not the dominant or determinant consideration (see <em>UYK v UYJ</em> (at [26])), it was nonetheless a significant factor in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s caregiving ability</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I noted from the CER that the Father appeared to be a highly involved parent who had demonstrated good knowledge of the children’s needs. The independent observations in the CER corroborated the evidence of the Father and third-party witnesses on his involvement in the lives of the children and his caregiving ability. The Father’s capacity to care for the children was also evident from the close relationship that the children shared with him. As admitted by the Mother herself, the children loved the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_122\" id=\"Ftn_122_1\"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Although the Mother had expressed concerns about the children’s care while they were with the Father, she had not shown how the proposed care arrangement in Brisbane would be any better.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s immigration status</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s immigration status in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Mother alleged that the Father’s OnePass application was for tactical reasons. She pointed out that the Father’s Employment Pass, the Mother’s Dependent Pass and the Children’s Dependent Passes were all valid up to 5 August 2026. There was hence no reason for the Father to have applied for the OnePass, 4 years before the expiry of his Employment Pass, save to facilitate his agenda in these proceedings. The OnePass allowed the Father to stay in Singapore until November 2028.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_123\" id=\"Ftn_123_1\"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Mother’s allegation raised a question of fact about the Father’s motive in applying for the OnePass. However, parties did not address how the Father’s immigration status was relevant to the inquiry. It should be noted that even a relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is not relevant <em>per se</em>. It is relevant only to the extent that it is found that there will be a transference of his or her insecurity and negative feelings onto the child: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (at [20]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     While the relevance of the Mother’s immigration status could be readily appreciated within the context of ascertaining the reasonableness of her wish to relocate, the relevance of the Father’s immigration status was less apparent. It cannot be assumed that any point of contention raised by a disputing party is necessarily relevant to the inquiry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Leaving aside the question of relevance, I found no merit in the Mother’s allegation in any event. The evidence showed that the Father’s employer was keen for him to obtain a OnePass even before the Mother’s relocation application was filed. However, the Father could only apply for OnePass in mid-2023 as he was required to establish a sufficient history of earnings in order to be eligible for OnePass.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_124\" id=\"Ftn_124_1\"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> Hence, it could not be the case that the Father had applied for OnePass to thwart the Mother’s relocation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s immigration status in Australia</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Mother also submitted that the Father, as a PR of Australia, would have the ability to stay in Australia, work, own properties and have banking accounts in his own name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_125\" id=\"Ftn_125_1\"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> The Father however chose not to move to or practise in Brisbane.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_126\" id=\"Ftn_126_1\"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father explained that the travel facility associated with his Australian PR had lapsed. There was no point in holding the Australian PR without an ability to enter and leave Australia. It was meaningless, and the Mother was conveniently describing a technicality without addressing the substance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_127\" id=\"Ftn_127_1\"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> To obtain a new visa, he would need to prove that he had “substantial ties” to Australia that were “of benefit” to Australia. The application would require time,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_128\" id=\"Ftn_128_1\"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> the conditions were not easily met<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_129\" id=\"Ftn_129_1\"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> and there was no certainty as to the likely outcome.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_130\" id=\"Ftn_130_1\"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Furthermore, the paternal grandmother had relocated from the UK to Singapore on 10 December 2021 to be reunited with the Father and the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_131\" id=\"Ftn_131_1\"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> The children’s bond with the grandmother was strong.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_132\" id=\"Ftn_132_1\"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> The grandmother would similarly encounter, and probably even more challenging issues, with respect to obtaining an Australian visa.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_133\" id=\"Ftn_133_1\"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The Father also explained that he would not be an attractive hire in Australia, especially in the context of a hastily arranged move. The absolute best-case outcome would be an Associate role, which would come with a huge reduction in remuneration and a period of operating as a trainee.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_134\" id=\"Ftn_134_1\"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> This was not an attractive option, and would be decidedly negative to the family. The children would not benefit from a father who was suddenly earning far less, but working infinitely more hours with far less professional independence and flexibility.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_135\" id=\"Ftn_135_1\"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In my view, it was not reasonable for the Mother to trivialise the challenges highlighted by the Father. These were real obstacles with potentially adverse consequences for the family and the children. Moreover, the marriage had broken down. The Father, unlike the Mother, was not an Australian citizen. It would not be reasonable to expect the Father to relocate to Australia, just as it would be unreasonable to expect the Mother to stay put in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Hence, even if the Father’s immigration status was relevant to the inquiry, it was not a factor in favour of relocation. At best, it was a neutral factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In conclusion, while I was satisfied that the Mother’s wish to relocate to Australia was not unreasonable or founded in bad faith, I found her wish to be incompatible with the interests of the children. Other than the fact that the children were Australian citizens, the Mother had not shown how the relocation to Australia would benefit the children compared to the <em>status quo</em>. Indeed, her relocation plan appeared to serve her interests rather than those of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     While her wish to restart her career and life was understandable, this would have to be balanced against other relevant factors as the paramount consideration was the welfare of the children. The children shared a close relationship with the Father and the older child, in particular, had expressed a clear wish to continue living in Singapore or Malaysia. The younger child was neutral but would like to be able to see both parents frequently and equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The Mother’s application for a LTVP had been rejected by the ICA while there were real challenges for the Father to relocate to Australia. The stark reality facing this family was that the parents would have to live in separate jurisdictions, at least in the foreseeable future. A shared care and control arrangement was no longer feasible. Either way, there would be a loss of relationship with the other parent which would have to be mitigated by a generous access plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     However, the Mother’s ability to co-parent if granted sole care and control in the event of relocation was a cause for concern. She was unable to recognise the Father’s contributions to the children’s upbringing and could only see all sorts of reasons to find fault with his parenting. Her lack of insight on the importance of co-parenting and belief that she had superior right made me doubt whether she would be able to support the father-sons bond, notwithstanding her assurance to the court that she would do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_136\" id=\"Ftn_136_1\"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> She had also sought to reduce the Father’s parenting time by seeking a sole care and control order even if relocation was not granted, which only deepened my doubt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In contrast, the Father had consistently demonstrated a willingness to support the children in having a close relationship with the Mother. In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, Judith Prakash J observed (at [45]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it would be in the children’s interests for them to be with the parent who was willing to be reasonable about access and could share them with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     As the Father was more likely to share the children with the Mother and facilitate generous access, the welfare of the children would be better served by allowing the children to be with the Father. This arrangement would also align with the children’s wishes and avoid any unnecessary disruption to their lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Balancing all factors, I concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the children to relocate to Brisbane at this point in time. Accordingly, the Mother’s relocation application was disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     As it was important for the family to heal and move on, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit in support of FC/OSG 60/2023 filed on 11 May

class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       MSS 1444 of 2024 (“MSS 1444”) was the Mother’s application to enforce the arrears in respect of an Order of Court <em>vide</em> MO xxx/2016. Pursuant to that order, the Father was ordered to pay a monthly sum of $350 for the maintenance of one child. Both parties were self-represented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 17 December 2024 and reserved judgment. On 14 January 2025, I handed down my decision and made the relevant orders. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother confirmed, during the hearing, that she was seeking to enforce arrears from January 2017 all the way up to August 2024. The total amount which the Mother sought to enforce thus came up to $32,200.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Given the time period in respect of which the Mother was seeking to recover arrears of maintenance, the first issue I had to deal with was whether the time bar set out in s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) was applicable. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Recovery of arrears of maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is clear that, s 121(3) of the WC applies to the present case. This is because s 74 of the WC states (see also <em>VLW v VLX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25137-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 84</a> at [19(a) and [20]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Application of section 121</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">74.    Section 121 applies, with the necessary modifications, to any order for the payment of maintenance under this Part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Given this, the Mother therefore had to show that there were such special circumstances which warranted her being able to recover arrears in respect of maintenance beyond the three years as provided for under s 121(3) of the WC: <em>Koay Guat Kooi (m w) v Eddie Yeo (formerly known as Yap Ah Huat alias Yeo Ah Nee)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6511-M.xml')\">[1997] SGHC 197</a> (“<em>Koay Guat Kooi</em>”) at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The time bar in s 121(3) of the WC ensures that applicants seeking to enforce a maintenance order do so in a timely fashion – doing so would reflect a true need on their part. This comports with the rationale for the court’s power to order maintenance: that is to “provide for the urgent and pressing financial needs of the receiving party, and to ensure that such needs are not deferred due to a lack of assurance that sums expended would eventually be compensated”: <em>VLW v VLX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25137-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 84</a> at [19(d)]. This time bar also ensures that the paying party is not taken by surprise where the recipient of maintenance makes no complaint about the non-payment of maintenance for several years, but one day, decides to haul the paying party to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       That said, the time bar in s 121(3) is not cast in absolute terms. The “special circumstances” exception accommodates situations where a “wife may have genuine reasons for not applying for recovery of arrears before” the expiry of the three-year period (see the Singapore Parliamentary Reports on the Third Reading of the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill (as reported from the Select Committee) dated 27 August 1996 at col 524).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There are, generally speaking, two broad situations where the court may find that there are special circumstances justifying the waiver of the three-year time bar: see <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The first are situations where the circumstances are “sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would do great injustice to the [applicant]”. Justice Choo Han Teck (“Choo J”) had made this observation in <em>Koay Guat Kooi</em>. That case concerned an appeal against the decision of a District Judge in respect of orders made relating to the division of the matrimonial flat and the award of past and current maintenance. The District Judge had declined to order arrears of maintenance for more than 3 years because of s 115(3) of the Women’s Charter which stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot;No amount owing as maintenance shall be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the wife in that case had contended that while this was the provision in force at the time of the hearing, the law had changed – the words “unless the court under special circumstances allows” were added to what was then s 115(3) of the Women’s Charter. According to counsel, there were special circumstances because parties had lived apart for 14 years, and in that time, the wife did not know where the husband was, and could therefore not ask for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This argument found little weight with Choo J who noted that there was no proof that efforts were “made by the wife to contact the husband but to no avail” and that given this, it could also be equally said that she did not wish to claim maintenance then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The second sort of situation where special circumstances are shown involve cases where the payor of maintenance has, through their actions, frustrated attempts to enforce the maintenance order, or taken steps to avoid paying the full sums owed in maintenance: <em>UAE</em> at [21(b)] and [21(c)]. There are two cases which illustrate this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>Meenatchi d/o Kuppusamy v Subbiah Pillai</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0202.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 202</a>, the wife had sought to enforce arrears of $103,500 for the period July 2006 to 21 March 2012. The court found that there were “special circumstances” which justified the recovery of arrears beyond the 3-year time bar. The wife in that case had first commenced enforcement proceedings against the husband in 2008 – however, her application fell through as the husband’s registered address could not be ascertained for service to be effected. The reason for this was apparent from the husband’s passport which showed that he had been travelling frequently to Malaysia, India and Bangladesh, and that he had been issued visas which allowed him to remain in India and Bangladesh for a few months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Second, in <em>Lee Meng Leng v Tan Huat Soon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16317-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 224</a> (“<em>Lee Meng Leng</em>”), the court had found that the respondent husband was in the habit of “unilaterally deduct[ing] monies from court-ordered maintenance” that was due to the complainant without first obtaining either the complainant’s agreement or a valid court order. The court thus considered it appropriate to allow enforcement of arrears beyond the 3-year time bar, noting that such “unilateral deductions from court-ordered maintenance by respondents c[ould] not be condoned by the courts”: <em>Lee Meng Leng</em> at [44] – [47].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Returning to the present case, I do not find that the Mother has shown that there are special circumstances which warrant allowing her to enforce the arrears beyond the three year period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     During the trial, the Mother gave two reasons as to why she was unable to bring an application to enforce the arrears owed earlier. The first was that she was the main caregiver for her children, and was therefore unable to find the time to come to court to file an application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second reason was that her ex-husband did not allow her to come to court to file an application. The Mother explained that her ex-husband was jealous of the Father. In that vein, it appears that the Mother was afraid of what might happen to her if she came to court to file an application to enforce the arrears<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> – she stated that her ex-husband was a “wife-beater”. The Mother also explained that she could not contact the Father as her ex-husband had deleted all the contacts in her phone and made her replace her SIM card.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     That being said, the Mother appears to have escaped the unfortunate situation with her ex-husband following their divorce in 2020. It would have been possible for her to file an enforcement application without having to live in fear of what her ex-husband might say or do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     During the hearing, I had asked the Mother to explain why she had waited for four years after her divorce with her ex-husband before bringing the present enforcement application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Mother explained that it was only in 2024 that she discovered that she was able to make an online application to enforce the arrears. Up to that point, her hands were full from looking after her children (which included one special needs child) on her own, dealing with her own health issues, and coping with various issues arising from her divorce (which included looking for a place to stay).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I could not accept this explanation. There was nothing, apart from what the Mother had said in her testimony, which had been put in evidence before me to demonstrate that the circumstances she faced in the years following her divorce rendered her unable to file an application. It would have been a different situation had the Mother, in the years following her divorce in 2020, filed an application for enforcement but subsequently abandoned that application. This was not the case. The only other enforcement application which the Mother had brought against the Father was in 2017, <em>vide</em> MSS xxxx/2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore find that the Mother is only entitled to enforce the maintenance arrears for a period of three years prior to the filing of her application in MSS 1444 (<em>ie</em>, 26 June 2021 to 26 June 2024). The arrears for this period comes up to a total of $12,600. In addition to this, I also take into account the arrears for the period from July to August 2024. I do so because it is undisputed between both parties that the Father had only started making payment in September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In summary, the total arrears that the Mother can enforce against the Father comes up to $13,300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The second issue which I turn now to address is whether the Father had shown cause. It is hornbook law that a respondent to enforcement proceedings is to be given a chance to “show cause” – in other words, the respondent is afforded an opportunity to provide satisfactory reasons as to why an enforcement order should not be made: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> (“<em>VUJ</em>”) at [20] citing <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a>; <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a> at [9] . In making an order for enforcement, the court must bear in mind whether the making of an enforcement order would “lead to injustice” or whether it would be “inequitable to do so given the circumstances and facts of a given case”: <em>VUJ</em> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Cases where the court has found it inequitable to enforce the maintenance order against a respondent include those where there was a mutual agreement between the parties that the amount of maintenance payable should be reduced. It also includes cases where the respondent had either gone above and beyond what was required under the maintenance order, or where the complainant had used the respondent’s money to pay for expenses falling within the scope of the maintenance order, or where the respondent had been diligently paying maintenance but had run into genuine financial difficulties and was therefore unable to keep up with the payments: <em>VUJ</em> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I do not find that the Father had shown cause. For one, there could not have been any sort of mutual agreement between the parties that the Mother was happy to forgo the sums owed under the maintenance order. Neither party disputed that they were, in the intervening years between 2017 up till September 2024 (which was when the Mother had texted the Father to demand payment)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, in contact with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to why the Father did not keep up with the maintenance payments, he explained to me that after the Mother’s previous application in 2017 had been struck off, he had simply assumed that the case was closed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father did not check with anyone as to whether he had to continue paying maintenance, and simply assumed that he could stop paying the $350 owed every month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I cannot accept that the Father had shown cause on the basis that he did not know he had to continue to comply with the order. If he was uncertain of the consequences of the Mother’s application being struck out, the onus was on him to check.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, I would add that I do not find that the Father had gone above and beyond the maintenance order. This issue arises because it emerged from the testimony of both parties, that the Father had made payment of $500 per month for the period September to December 2024. It would thus appear that the Father had paid more than the stipulated $350 monthly sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father, however, had explained that he had paid an extra $150 because that sum of money was meant for a second child which he had with the Mother. To contribute this sum of $500, the Father had resorted to doing more overtime shifts at work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     While the Father’s efforts to provide for both his children are indeed commendable, this is not something I can give weight to in deciding whether the Father had shown cause. The facts of the present case are quite different from that in <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> (at [22] – [27]) where the court had found that the respondent husband had gone above and beyond the maintenance order. In that case, the husband had been paying the wife monthly maintenance of $6,500 although the court order only provided for a monthly maintenance sum of $5,725. In addition to that, the husband had also met the entirety of his obligations to pay for the other items under the court order as well as items which did not come within the ambit of the order. Given this, the court found that the husband had always, when he was financially able, done his part and gone beyond his legal obligations to support the wife. Because of this, it would have been inequitable to penalise the husband for falling behind on maintenance payments now that he found himself in dire financial straits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, it is undisputed that the Father had not complied with the order of maintenance. The Father had admitted to this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> And while the Father’s additional payment might have had the effect of reducing the Mother’s financial burden – it must be emphasised that a parent has the obligation to provide for their children: s 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961. The Father is simply doing what is expected of him as a parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I therefore find that the Father has not shown cause and order that the arrears, which come up to $13,300, be enforced against him. The Father shall pay off these arrears in monthly instalments of $100 with effect from 1 February 2025. This payment shall be made to the Mother’s designated bank account on the last day of each month.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9, ln 14 – 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9 ln 26 – 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13, ln 27 – 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13, ln 20 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 4 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 14 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>This application was struck out as the Mother did not turn up for the hearing.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript at p 9, ln 2 – 6 and p 18 ln 1 – 7 and ln 26 - 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Transcript at p 30, ln 1 – 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, ln 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, ln 25 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>The appeal against the decision of the District Judge in DCA 16/2014 was deemed withdrawn on 1 July 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Transcript p 19 at ln 26 – 30.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order","Family Law – Domestic Exclusion Order"],"date":"2025-04-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 265 and 280 of 2024","title":"XKY v XKX and another matter","citation":"[2025] SGFC 37","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33099-SSP.xml","counsel":["The applicant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-04-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XKY v XKX and another matter</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XKY <em>v</em> XKX and another matter </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33099-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 37</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The parents had taken out applications for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for themselves and their youngest son in SS 265 and 280 of 2024. In addition to the PPO, a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) was also sought. The respondent is their eldest son [XKX].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over the course of three days. Upon conclusion of the trial, I reserved judgment, after parties had made their respective oral submissions. On 21 March 2025, I handed down my judgment, allowing the applications in both SS 265 and 280, and giving the following reasons for doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is well-established law that an applicant for a PPO must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities. First, that the respondent had either committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> or was likely to commit family violence. Second, that the PPO is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I found that XKX was indeed likely to commit family violence. It was apparent from the course of his testimony, that he bore a deep grudge towards his parents and younger brother. XKX recounted how his parents would favour his younger brother – for instance, he shared how his parents had purchased the latest gadgets for his younger brother, but neglected to do the same for him. He also recounted how he would have to shoulder the blame for the fights and scuffles that he would have with his younger brother. Whenever these fights took place, his mother would cane him, but do nothing to discipline his younger brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Naturally, XKX’s parents felt wronged by his accusation that they had especially doted on or favoured his younger brother over him. The both of them, especially XKX’s mother, sought to challenge XKX’s narrative on this point during the course of XKX’s cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In assessing the merits of both applications, it is not necessary for me to decide whether XKX’s parents had indeed doted on him, nor do I need to determine whether XKX had a valid basis for holding a grudge against the rest of his family. What was abundantly clear to me was that XKX did hold this deep-seated grudge which left him feeling isolated and all alone in the world as he had no member of his family to confide in, to the point where he only had ChatGPT to turn to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       More importantly, however, that grudge which XKX held did lead him to lash out violently against his family members. His father bore the brunt of XKX’s wrath as was evident from the various pictures showing the extent of his injuries. Indeed, XKX did not deny hitting his father, nor did XKX deny getting into several altercations with his parents as well as his younger brother. These altercations demonstrated XKX’s proclivity for violence – for instance, XKX admitted to biting his brother. He also recounted how he had gone into “a frenzy” when his father had, in one incident, grabbed him by the collar – he lashed out blindly and kicked his mother in the leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As to the necessity of ordering a PPO, the cases tell us that once it is established that the respondent is likely to commit family violence, it follows as a matter of logic that a PPO is necessary to protect the applicant: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Leaving aside any presumption, on the facts before me, I found it necessary to order a PPO for the protection of XKX’s parents as well as his younger brother. Determining the necessity of a PPO is, in essence, a risk assessment: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. The court must consider the likelihood of the respondent committing further acts of family violence on the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     A PPO is indeed necessary in the present case. XKX still bears a deep resentment towards his parents and younger brother, and he has, through his own account of the incidents in contention, demonstrated a propensity for violence. These are significant red flags pointing towards the necessity of a PPO. While XKX has already moved out to live on his own, and indicated that he wished to cut off any and all ties with his family, the mere physical separation in this case does not suffice to reduce the risk of family violence. Until XKX has learnt to let go of his hate, anger and animosity towards the rest of his family, it is, in my judgment, quite likely that there will continue to be a high risk of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In this connection, and for the same reasons that I have already set out, I also find it necessary to grant a DEO for the protection or personal safety of the applicant. This enforced physical separation is needed to ensure that there are no further acts of physical violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In summary, both applications in SS 265 and 280 are allowed in its entirety. In addition to the PPO and DEO, I am also ordering that all parties (XKX, as well as his parents and younger brother) go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On this final note, I conclude with a few words to XKX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     While I have made the relevant orders against you, I must emphasise that the purpose of this trial was to ascertain whether a PPO and a DEO should be granted for the protection of your family members. The orders that I have made are not meant to punish you. They are meant to ensure the protection of your parents and younger brother. That much is made clear by the relevant provisions in the Women’s Charter as well as the jurisprudence of the Family Courts (see <em>e.g</em>. <em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I must also remind you of the effect of these orders. You are not to commit family violence on your parents or your younger brother. This includes physically attacking, or verbally abusing them. The breach of these orders is an arrestable offence, for which penalties include a fine or imprisonment: see s 65(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In practical terms, this is effect of the DEO which I have ordered: home is now behind you – but a whole world lies ahead. I strongly urge you to use this as a fresh start. Where you go from here is entirely up to you, but nothing is impossible if you are willing to learn and to put in the hard work. Above all, you must work on laying to rest the grievances, resentment and hurt you have accrued over the years for you will not truly be at peace until you have done so.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[XKX] had, due to his age, a litigation representative (his aunt) at the hearing before me.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>References to the Women’s Charter 1961 in this judgment are references to the version in force before 2 January 2025.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Lasting Power of Attorney – Statutory Declaration – Mental Capacity Assessment – Functional and Clinical Component"],"date":"2025-04-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSM 35/2024","title":"XKF v XKG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 33","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33081-SSP.xml","counsel":["Han Guang Yuan, Keith and Korycinska, Joanna Karolina (Oon & Bazul LLP) for the Plaintiff","Chenthil Kumar Kumarasingam, Thaddeus Oh and Muhammad Matin Bin Abdul Razak (Withers Khattarwong LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-04-09T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XKF v XKG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XKF <em>v</em> XKG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33081-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 33</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OSM 35/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 April 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Han Guang Yuan, Keith and Korycinska, Joanna Karolina (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the Plaintiff; Chenthil Kumar Kumarasingam, Thaddeus Oh and Muhammad Matin Bin Abdul Razak (Withers Khattarwong LLP) for the Defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XKF — XKG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Lasting Power of Attorney</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Statutory Declaration</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Mental Capacity Assessment</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Functional and Clinical Component</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 April 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff filed an application for a declaration that his mother (P) did not have mental capacity when she executed a lasting power of attorney (LPA) on 23 August 2023 and accordingly to revoke the LPA. The second substantive prayer was for the court to declare that a statutory declaration (SD) P made on the same day is invalid, and for the same reason. Section 19 of the Mental Capacity Act<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (MCA) empowers a court to make declarations as to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a> <em>(a) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make a decision specified in the declaration;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a> <em>(b) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make decisions on the matters described in the declaration;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a> <em>(c) the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done or yet to be done, in relation to that person.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The defendant is the brother of P and the uncle of the plaintiff. He is named as the sole donee of powers under the LPA while the defendant’s son is named as the successor, in the event the defendant is unable to perform his duties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It was not disputed that at the time of the hearing, P did not have mental capacity. Section 17(4) of the Act provides that a court may revoke a LPA if P does not have the mental capacity to do so. Having heard the evidence, I allowed the application. The defendant appeals against the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Factual Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The plaintiff is 60 years old and the only child of P. He lives in Australia with his family. The defendant is 90 years old and an American citizen. He lives in the United States of America (U.S). Both the plaintiff and defendant are medical doctors. P is an 86-year-old British National and a permanent resident in Singapore. The defendant, P and another sister lost their parents during World War II and the defendant expressed how he has been very protective of his sisters arising from those early challenges. They appear to have grown up in a very loving environment after their adoption by a couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Up until 21 July 2023, P was living in a condominium unit in Singapore. On 2 August 2023, she was moved to a transitional care facility under the care of medical doctors. Given the medical challenges P was facing, the defendant visited Singapore in August 2023 to attend to matters relating to 2 properties that were in the name of P. The defendant’s last visit was when P and the defendant’s mother had passed away in 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       When the plaintiff visited P later in December 2023, he found letters from the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) and discovered that P had a LPA issued on 24 August 2023 and registered on 14 November 2023. He subsequently discovered that P had also made a SD on the same day which effectively acknowledges that two residential properties in Singapore which included the condominium P was living in prior to her admission to the care facility, and ownership of a company which was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 1997 belonged to the defendant. P however is the sole director and shareholder of this company but according to the defendant, P was holding it on trust for the defendant. It was the defendant’s position that the company was used to purchase the 2 residential properties and that it was effectively his properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The plaintiff was of the view that P could not have had the mental capacity to execute the LPA and SD and sought declarations that these documents were not valid arising from such incapacity. He based his position on his interactions with P and medical records dating back to 2017. In 2017, P started to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment. In 2020 she was diagnosed with dementia by a geriatrician at a local hospital. On 13 July 2023, doctors at the same hospital were of the view that P had moderate dementia. On 21 July 2023, she was admitted to another hospital after a fall and remained there till 2 August 2023. A doctor from the hospital’s psychological medicine unit informed that P had no mental capacity to manage her affairs, and she was transferred to a transitional facility at the Singapore Expo Hall. On 8 September 2023, a cognitive neurologist (Dr A) from the hospital, saw and diagnosed P with Alzheimer’s disease. Over a 3-month period from September to December 2023, P saw a senior psychiatrist consultant (Dr B) at the hospital she was attended to prior to her fall. Dr B expressed that she had grave concerns about the capacity of P especially with regards her ability to manage her financial affairs. On 15 December 2023 the same cognitive neurologist who diagnosed P with Alzheimer’s disease on 8 September 2023 was of the view that P had no mental capacity to take care of her personal and financial affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It was the position of the defendant that the SD and the LPA are properly executed documents. The SD was made before a Commissioner for Oaths (CFO) and practising lawyer of about 20 years. A consultant psychiatrist (Dr C) who met P on 1 December 2022, 22 August 2023 and 24 August 2023 was of the view that P had the mental capacity to do so. Dr C also met with a female relative of P and the son of the defendant to obtain more information on P on 29 November 2022 and 15 August 2022, respectively. A consultant geriatrician (Dr D) and consultant neurologist (Dr E), both in private practice, had given evidence to explain certain positions with respect to mental capacity assessments generally and to opine on the evidence of the doctors called by the plaintiff, specifically. Neither had the opportunity of assessing P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Relevant Laws</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       With the enactment of the MCA in 2008 and encouragement in recent years by the OPG Singapore residents to make a LPA, many have taken the step to do so. A LPA provides the opportunity to exercise one’s autonomy in choosing the person or persons one would like to manage one’s personal welfare and financial matters, if and when one loses capacity to do so. Much like the choice of an executor of a will, a donor’s choice of donee is rooted in trust. The making of a LPA must therefore always be reflective of the choice of the donor who can only make that choice with cognitive awareness and an understanding of the powers he is vesting in a donee. A LPA is only activated when the donor is medically assessed to have lost mental capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given that the contention in this case was that P had no mental capacity to make the LPA and SD, it must be shown that P was unable to make those decisions and that the inability was caused by a mental impairment. These refer to the functional and clinical components of assessment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It is important to appreciate that suffering from a neurodegenerative disease does not mean that a person lacks the mental capacity to make decisions. One must look at the individual at the time the decision was made and the nature of the decision itself. This important guidance is provided at paragraph 4.3.2 of the Code of Practice: MCA (September 2023) issued by the OPG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The requirements for capacity to be determined are provided in s 5(1) of the MCA against the backdrop of s 3 of the Act which refers to the presumption of capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Under the provisions of s 5(1), P must have been able to understand the information relevant to her decisions, be able to retain it, use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision and then to communicate the same. A failure to establish any one of these would require a conclusion of mental incapacity. Expert evidence on P’s mental impairment is critical insofar as assisting the court with an understanding of the nature of the impairment and its effects on cognition. The functional aspect and more particularly, the question of whether the provisions of s 5(1) of the MCA are met are well within the ability of a court to assess even without the assistance of clinicians.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Functional and Clinical Components </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The plaintiff spoke of the cognitive difficulties his mother appears to have been facing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> since 2020. Although having a 70% shareholding in a company and benefitting from the rent obtained from the company’s ownership of a 3-storey commercial property which was leased, she failed to encash cheques for such rental income in 2020. The plaintiff claimed to have also assisted P in filing her income tax returns between 2021 and 2023 because she was unable to do so. He also came to learn that P had opened a joint account with 2 individuals who appear to be distant relatives of P and a sum of $200 000 was withdrawn from an account P held with her sister and placed into the new account with these 2 individuals. In 2023, when the plaintiff visited P in Singapore, P could not recall having opened this account. P had fallen in her home in July 2023 and was hospitalised. She was assessed by a doctor to lack mental capacity and had to be moved to a care facility on 2 August 2023. Her cognitive frailty was therefore observed although not clinically assessed at that point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The defendant claimed to have had a close relationship with P and suggested that the relationship between P and the plaintiff was not as strong. I did not doubt that P had great affection for the defendant. He too however, has had little direct interaction with P, given that prior to his visit in 2023, he had come to Singapore 13 years ago. In the time he was here in 2023, the LPA and SD were executed, raising concerns about the timing of such an exercise and the reason why it was done without engaging the plaintiff who is the only child of P. Depending on the nature of the decision that needs to be made, engagement with key members of P’s immediate family is a prudent step in understanding the capacity of P to make those decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this case, the only doctor who assessed the mental capacity of P shortly before the LPA and SD were executed on 24 August 2023 and who then certified her capacity to make those documents was Dr C. With the benefit of the assessment done just 2 days prior to execution of documents, his assessment must and was given considerable weight. He is a qualified doctor with vast experience. The issue centred on the adequacy of the manner of such assessment as it related to the decision by P to execute the 2 documents in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The CFO before whom P affirmed her SD is a lawyer of 20 years. He stated in his affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> that he could not recall the situation at the time the SD was signed by P before him. He however was of the view that he would not have enabled the execution if he felt P did not have the capacity to sign it. Little turns on the evidence of the CFO given his inability to remember P and any interaction that he had with her prior to the signing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It was Dr C’s position that P had the mental capacity to execute both the LPA and the SD. I could not safely conclude this for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) that was conducted on 22 August 2023 showed significant difficulties with respect to time, attention and recall ability. The score of 20/30 obtained on this examination suggests only mild impairment but as generally accepted by all the medical professionals, the score is of less significance than what P found challenging during the examination and its relevance to the type of document executed. I was mindful that in having patients with dementia respond to questions, the medical professional would engage at a level which makes the patient comfortable and responsive. There is no need for grammatically correct sentences and even gestures are often used to communicate. P’s inability to recall 3 simple objects 3 minutes after she was shown those items made any suggestion that she had the ability to retain rather complex information related to the SD and LPA such that she was able to use the information and communicate her decisions thereafter, difficult to accept.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The contents of the SD were read to P by Dr C. The contents are by no means simple to understand for a person of advanced age, known to suffer from a neurodegenerative condition. It states <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“<em>I do not hold, nor have I ever held any rights, title and interest in the property situated at XXX (property UEC) and YYY (property NR). To the best of my knowledge and belief, my brother…is the true and only owner of ZZZ (Company R)”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>P then asserts that she was “<em>willing to sign any document to ensure</em>” her brother “<em>remains or becomes the only owner</em>” of the properties and company. The author of these words appears to be concerned about a potential contest to his rights to the named assets. The question is not so much about his entitlement to the same but if it were appropriate to have P endorse such wording as hers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>P was not aware, according to Dr C, of the existence of property NR and Company R. It was the defendant’s position that property UEC was purchased to house their late mother and P who was giving care to their late mother. It was his position that after the passing of their mother, P continued to stay there and the defendant paid for all her expenses as this was what their late mother wanted the defendant to do for P. His explanation with respect to property NR is simply that it was rented out and the rental income was used to pay management fees and the like. It is unclear why the defendant needed to buy this particular property and leave it in P’s name unless there were some restrictions related to his foreign status. So too remains unexplained, why the shares in Company R was held by P solely and the reason behind P holding this on trust for the defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Even if I were to ignore the fact that there is little evidence to support the position of the defendant’s entitlement and accept that P was eager to ensure the defendant’s entitlement to the assets, the lack of knowledge of the existence of the assets which were in her name makes any declaration that she had no rights in the same unacceptable. Dr C merely informing her of the existence of property NR and that it belonged to the defendant is clearly unsatisfactory. A vulnerable person is in a space where things told by a trusted source is often accepted readily. If it relates to a family member who is loved, the readiness is understandable. I did not doubt P’s love for the defendant. I did doubt her awareness of the contents of the SD. Given that there was no engagement of P’s son who is the sole heir to her estate in the absence of a will, declarations of this nature during a time of vulnerability should be approached with some degree of caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     P had no knowledge of her directorship or shareholding in Company R. In fact, when Dr C asked P if she were a shareholder, she was not aware. This lack of awareness is crucial to any determination of the validity of the SD. One cannot give away rights to ownership if one is not even aware of having those rights. Dr C did not question P about her directorship. He appears to have rooted his opinion on P’s ability to execute the SD on the sincerity he detected in Ps desire to let the defendant retain ownership or control of property UEC which she was allowed to stay in. While it is incumbent on the medical professional to assist his patient to appreciate the facts without inadvertently substituting judgment on behalf of the patient,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> P in this case was essentially signing a document based on information that Dr C obtained from the defendant. Given that this document essentially places ownership of assets in the hands of the defendant, reliance on information supplied by the defendant himself in the context of the lack of knowledge by P on the nature of assets in question, is unsafe. It bears repeating that the lack of engagement of P’s son suggests the need to block challenges to asset ownership. If anything, it should raise the need to engage and have a clear perspective on the family dynamics. Clearly not all family members need to be engaged. Given that the plaintiff is P’s only child, I was of the view that his involvement was important. In fact, the defendant’s son is named as a replacement donee in the event the defendant is not able to be perform his duties. If the nature of the relationship guided the appointment, it was not explained as to why the nephew is someone P was comfortable in appointing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In relation to the LPA, I had similar concerns. P appears not to know the extent of her own estate. Other than potential interest in properties UEC, NR and Company R, her estate is relatively vast with 21 known bank accounts,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> term deposits, a securities portfolio of more than S$1.6 million, pension, Central Provident Fund (CPF) payouts and a 70 % shareholding in a company that owns a commercial property. I did not expect P to know every asset that she had but I do consider it necessary for her to show an understanding of at least some of the significant assets in her name. It appears to be the case from Dr C’s evidence,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> that trust in an individual to be the donee, is sufficient. While trust is fundamental, an awareness of what one has as assets which is entrusted to another to manage is imperative. Counsel for the plaintiff referred to <b><em>The Public Guardian </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>RI and Ors</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> in this regard, where Justice Poole stated in the context of those facts that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“RD may have understood that he was signing something important, that it was to do with money and that RI and RO were to look after his money for him, but the evidence tends to show that he had no understanding of their powers”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Similarly in the case before me, without any understanding of the breadth of one’s estate, it appears implausible that P knew much about the powers she was vesting in the defendant. At one particular part of the LPA, she even went on to endorse the ability of the defendant to sell or transfer her residential property without approval of the court. It appears odd that someone who insisted that she had nothing would need to say this. It is more likely that the LPA form, the details of which were not filled up by P, was a reflection of nothing more than the trust P had in the defendant to continue helping her with her needs, rather than a reflection of any awareness of the scope of the powers or the assets that were left with him to manage for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Counsel for the defendant submitted that in <b><em>Re DT </em></b><b>(UK)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></b> the court had found that the donor of powers had the ability to indicate who should have the power of attorney in spite of his diagnosis of dementia and more crucially, in spite of the court-appointed doctor’s position that the donor did not have any awareness of his financial situation. In <em>DT</em> however, the application was by the Public Guardian to revoke an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) which was executed by the donor on account of suspicion of a breach of duty by the donees. The donor had executed the EPA in 2007 a year after he had suffered a head injury. The question before the court was whether the donor could take care of his own matters and if he did not have the mental capacity to do so, the revocation of the EPA was sought to enable the Suffolk City Council to step in as deputy for <em>DT</em>. The question was not whether <em>DT</em> had the mental capacity at the time the EPA was executed. In finding that <em>DT</em> wanted the donees (his sons) to continue with their powers as, the EFA was retained. It is important to understand the context the facts of <em>DT</em> were set within.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Counsel for the defendant also referred to the evidence of a court -appointed doctor in <b><em>TEB </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>TEC</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> who opined that “<em>I think I have re-emphasised the point again and again that you don’t have to be perfect cognitively to execute the LPA OPG, because if you had to be perfect, then I’d guess that probably about a third of Singaporeans above the age of 60 who have hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol, including possibly some in this room, will not be able to execute an OPG LPA.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></em> In contrast to another doctor who was of the opinion that a person making a LPA must understand the legal document, the court-appointed doctor said “…<em>how many of us can understand the insurance legal documents or many legal documents that are put to us?...Again, it must be seen in the context of the OPG LPA. Do I recognise someone I love? Do I believe that that person will put my interests first? Can I choose them to decide whether or not, to help me, to help the doctors decide whether I should get the care I need?...if you understood what the policy intent of this…fully funded by the Singapore government, as part of our overall plan for ageing populations. It was meant to make it accessible and affordable for all Singaporeans</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is my view that while perfection is certainly not called for, greater caution must be exercised in the context of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases executing a LPA, given their vulnerability. In fact, what the LPA form says and what appears to be understood by some medical professionals are at odds. In section 8 of the LPA<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Dr C certified that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d-p3_a\"></a> <em>(a) The donor understands the purpose of the instrument, including his/her intention to appoint the persons named as donee (s) and replacement donee (s) and powers granted to donee (s) and replacement donee(s) set out on pages 3-7.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d-p3_b\"></a> <em>(b) There was no fraud or undue pressure; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d-p3_c\"></a> <em>(c) There is nothing else that would prevent this LPA from being created.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Section 4 of the LPA falls within pages 3-7 mentioned in (a) above. Yet, Dr C did not read or explain Section 4 of the LPA which relates to “Other Powers” that were given to the donee. He took the position that some of the powers are not important to be read back. I do not agree. A LPA unlike an application for deputyship, is executed at a time when the donor is deemed to have capacity. It is important therefore that all matters on the form are to be read and explained and not just ones that the certificate issuer deems more appropriate. The wording on the LPA itself calls for this. This need is especially critical when the donor is a person known to have a neurogenerative disease. The standard of care is high, a standard that can only be met if all parts of the LPA form are sufficiently explained in the context of establishing that the donor is aware of the breadth of one’s estate and the powers in relation to that estate that is being vested in the appointed donee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The court-appointed doctor in <b><em>TEB </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>TEC</em></b> explained that the focus should be on whether a donor is close to the donee and trusts the latter to care for him. In the case before me, while it can be accepted that the defendant is close to P, it does not explain the choice of the defendant’s son as the replacement donee. Dr C certified that P understood the intention in appointing the defendant’s son but nothing supports this. Either P went along with any suggestion that was made to her or she did not understand it but endorsed it anyway. Either way, more questions arise from the choice. The defendant’s son lives abroad. Even the choice of the defendant may have been made without knowledge of important circumstances. The defendant shared with Dr C that he had undergone challenging medical treatment. He is 90 years of age. Did P truly appreciate the challenges that the defendant is likely to face if he were to continue with her care? I was of the view that she did not because she was not engaged in such discussions. The reality is that the defendant’s son would likely take over P’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Dr C indicated that he had met with a “niece” of P on 29 November 2022 without P’s presence. The reference to “niece” in Dr C’s report appears to be a mistake as she was described by the defendant to be a cousin.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> On 1 December 2022, P was brought to see Dr C by this “niece”. The “niece” described P’s relationship with the plaintiff as not a close one. P shared that her son meant no harm to her but that they were not close as he was largely cared for by his grandmother when he was growing up. The “niece” according to the defendant, is part of a network of support for P as the defendant lives in the U.S. Rather unfortunately, no one from this support network could take care of P when she was discharged from the hospital after her fall in July 2023. On 15 August 2023, Dr C met the defendant and his son without P. No meeting took place with the plaintiff. P’s sister was also not engaged as P had indicated that they were not close. While it is appreciated that P’s sister who is advanced in age may not be able to provide information to Dr C that may be helpful to his assessment, reaching out to P’s son was an important step that should have been taken. He is P’s only child and there was no reason for the defendant not to reach out to him for purposes of informing him of his decision to have P assessed. The defendant, by bringing in his own son in the event the defendant was not able to care for P, spells a desire to keep the plaintiff out. For an important decision like the execution of a LPA and SD, transparency is needed and secrecy avoided. There was no indication that the plaintiff did not care for his mother. There were regular phone calls and visits by the plaintiff once a year. Geographical distance between P and her son, some difficulty in the relationship between P and her daughter-in-law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> were all possible reasons for the perception of lack of care. In fact, Dr B suggested possible paranoid beliefs which is common in dementia. Dr C’s other reason for not engaging the son was that he was living in Australia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, a fact equally applicable to the defendant and his son who live in the U.S. This case therefore involves immediate family members who do not live in Singapore, which therefore provides sufficient reason to engage all and ascertain the accuracy of the defendant’s entitlement to the properties mentioned in the SD, the breadth of P’s estate and the observations of the family with respect to P’s capacity in recent years. Perhaps engagement would have resulted in the family considering the feasibility of professional deputies to manage P’s large estate given indications of cognitive decline documented by medical professionals from 2020, approximately 3 years before the execution of the SD and LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Although the plaintiff chose to rely on the medical opinion of 2 doctors, I did not give weight to the evidence of Dr A who was of the view that P could not have had the mental capacity to execute the SD and LPA in August 2023 for the very reason highlighted earlier in these grounds with reference to Dr C’s assessment. Dr A saw P on 8 and 15 September 2023 but had limited interaction, relying largely on low scores on mental tests administered by his neuropsychologist. I could not therefore accept the basis of his position that P likely lacked mental capacity as at August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     What I did accept as evidence of relevance and value was that of Dr B. She had seen P on 3 occasions, namely, 18 September 2023, 14 December 2023 and 18 December 2023 and put in considerable time and effort in understanding the mental state of P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> She administered both the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) where P scored 1/10 indicative of cognitive decline and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) recording a score of 14/30. She explained that “<em>I wouldn’t pay excessive reliance on whether the score is 20/30 or 14/23. What is important for the clinician, which I’m answering here in court, it’s very important for the clinician to make that clinical judgment and not be excessively reliant on screening tools and scores because they do not replace judgment.”</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> She had on P’s second visit stated that P was incapacitated and suggested a court appointed deputy to manage her finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Both Dr B and Dr C had the benefit of speaking and assessing P’s capacity. It is recognised that a key difference is that Dr C assessed P just 2 days prior to the execution of the LPA and SD were executed. It bears repeating that I agree with the submission that the assessment should therefore be given considerable weight. Dr B saw P over 3 months (from September to December 2023) with a more complete examination on the second visit. I am of the view that it was still a period in sufficient proximity to the time of document execution. I was inclined to give Dr B’s assessment due consideration given the areas of concern with respect to how Dr C concluded on P’s capacity with reference to the 2 documents. If the nature of the documents were less complex, the determination of capacity by Dr C may well have been sufficient. If there were any other documentary evidence or evidence from a person in regular contact with P who may have shed light on P’s long held intentions and understanding of the extent of her estate, the determination may also have been different.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It was the position of Dr B that the considerations that a person in P’s position would have to take into account in the making of a LPA was not simpler than when making a will.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> She saw both as involving financial decision-making capacity. The exchange during re-examination was as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:     <em>So can I just ask you to explain why you say that -- can you elaborate on why you say LPA will come under complex tasks? What is it about the decisions that one has to make when signing the LPA makes it such a complex task?</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:     <em>Because it’s being – having understanding in terms of the finances and choosing an appropriate person as donee. But we’re looking at – we’re also looking at impairments in terms of impaired financial skills, which we see in dementia, so it would be important to piece that information: is the patient showing signs of impairments in terms of decision-making/judgment/reasoning, before they make appropriate choices. For LPA, to make that appropriate choice in terms of giving powers for the person, in terms of choice of donee, they would be able to process all of this, so it doesn’t come under a simple task.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>It was Dr B’s position that merely trusting a person to be a donee is insufficient as the complexity of the task of making a LPA requires an understanding of financial matters which she did not seem to have even during the assessment by Dr C. The need for this understanding is implicit in the way the LPA form itself is drafted, calling for <em>all</em> information to be read and understood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The defendant called on 2 more doctors. The evidence of Dr D, a consultant geriatrician <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and Dr E, a consultant neurologist<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> was helpful insofar as it provided an understanding that differences in opinion amongst the doctors who assessed P may be a result of the mood of P on the day or days she met the different doctors, as well as any other medical condition which may have impacted her level of attention or responsiveness during those days. However, the fact that they did not meet with P makes any opinion they have on the propriety of the assessments by Dr C of little value to the determination of the mental state of P on 24 August 2023. Indeed, such reviews should be avoided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> A proper assessment of mental capacity must certainly arise from private interaction between doctor and patient, sufficient knowledge of the personal and medical history of the patient including an understanding of family dynamics, utilisation of screening tools such as the MMSE and MoCA, results from blood work and the imaging of the brain, where appropriate. While Dr C was the only one who had the opportunity to interact with P around the time of the document execution, the nature of the documents that is in question call for a high degree of care where the person executing it was by Dr C’s own diagnosis, suffering from a major neurocognitive disorder. In fact, the defendant’s own witness Dr D, said during cross-examination, that the making of a LPA involves “<em>multiple levels of processing, so it’s different. Choosing a drink is a one-off decision with very little downstream implications. So to me it is clearly different…in signing an LPA, as you would know, there are different facets, whether it’s in terms of welfare, whether it’s with regards to managing my finances, whether it’s with regards managing my health issues, so I will be interested if a patient comes to me to see if the patient understands what he or she is doing and why he or she makes a particular decision</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> This observation aligns with Dr B’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The defendant’s interest in the 2 residential properties and business entity, which compelled him to have P execute the SD is not an issue in these proceedings. Should there be a contest with respect to ownership or entitlement to these assets, it would be for a different time and a different court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     When one makes a LPA or a SD, it is an expression of one’s autonomy. It should not be interfered with unless there is good reason to do so. In the context of persons who have neurodegenerative conditions, it would be prudent to have them make a LPA to appoint someone they trust, to care for them and to manage their properties before the condition worsens. The appointment is particularly challenging as there are indeed good days and bad days, times of clarity and times of confusion. The standards to be adopted in assessing such a person’s understanding of relatively complex documents such as a LPA and a SD must be sufficiently high. Even if one were to trust another to manage one’s property and personal matters, a reasonable awareness of the extent of one’s estate and a reasonable understanding of what powers are being vested in a donee must be present. P in this case did not know very much apart from the fact that she was grateful to her brother for allowing her to stay at one of his properties. She allowed the defendant to do what he wanted with immoveable properties without court approval when she was not aware of what these properties were. The only child she has was not consulted even though there is no significant disagreement between mother and son and there has been reasonable contact between the two even as he lives abroad with his family. There was no reason why the defendant’s son was appointed as a successor donee. I am mindful of the fact that the wisdom ought not to be questioned. What I am concerned with is the inability to extend the reason behind her choice of her brother to her brother’s son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The assessment of Dr C was given due weight. He was the one who assessed P closest in time to the execution of the documents. The ability of P to act is always time and decision specific. I was mindful that she did not need to know everything about her estate but the lack of knowledge in this case was troubling. The tenor of the LPA and SD was complex, requiring better understanding than was displayed by P when assessed by Dr C. The capacity of P to execute the documents did not meet the requirements of s 5(1) of the MCA. Dr C’s assessment was viewed against Dr B’s assessments a short period after the documents were executed. Her explanations tied in with Dr D’s evidence on the nature of a LPA and the need to move away from thinking it is a simple document requiring simple decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Applications have been filed by both parties separately for appointment as a deputy of P’s personal welfare and financial matters. Parties have also attempted to resolve matters through the appointment of a professional deputy, which is in my view prudent, given P’s large estate and the fact that both parties live abroad. This has not however been agreed to. Even if P does not have any interest in the properties and companies that formed part of the subject matter in these proceedings, her care may be better handled by a professional deputy in Singapore.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Cap 177A, 2020 rev.ed.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><b><em>Re BKR</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17722-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 81</a> (SGCA).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><b><em>Wong Meng Cheong &amp;

The Courts, however, might be prepared to pierce through such privilege in certain exceptional circumstances. In this case, it was alleged that the WP communications in question showed unambiguous impropriety and/or that it was tantamount to blackmail, such that the Court should disregard parties desire to negotiate a settlement and admit such correspondence into evidence. The Defendant Father (the “<b>Father</b>”) filed such an application for the Court’s consideration in FC/SUM 2661/2024 (“<b>SUM 2661</b>”). Having measured parties’ arguments on this novel point of law, I found that the Father had not discharged his burden of proving his case for such evidence to be admitted. The Father, dissatisfied with my decision, filed his appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff Mother (the “<b>Mother</b>”) and the Father (the “<b>Parties</b>”) are both Singapore citizens. The Mother is of Ukrainian descent and the Father is of Indian descent. Both of them are presently in their 40s and they got married in Singapore in 2015. They have 2 children of the marriage, a boy and a girl, who are in Primary schooling (the “<b>Children</b>”). The Mother also has 2 children from her prior marriage, an adult daughter and a teenager son, who had been jointly cared for by the Parties before their separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties have been embroiled in matrimonial proceedings since late 2019 and I have been their docketed judge since early 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Relevant history of the proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties first approached the Family Justice Courts in August 2019, whereby the Mother had initiated Personal Protection Order (“<b>PPO</b>”) proceedings against the Father in relation to all four (4) children and herself. The Mother then shortly after, initiated divorce proceedings against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The PPO proceedings were subsequently resolved by consent, with the Father consenting to a PPO made in favour of the Mother, but with the PPO proceedings in relation to the four (4) children being withdrawn. Counselling had also been ordered for Parties in relation to this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       With regard to the divorce proceedings, interim judgment was granted by consent in January 2020. For a marriage that had lasted about 5 years, the Parties have been involved in legal proceedings for about an equivalent amount of time. Parties were both initially represented by legal counsel, however, after the initial phases of the divorce, the Father started representing himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Both Parties filed for interim custody, care and control and access application for the two (2) children of the marriage. After a Custody Evaluation Report had been conducted, interim care and control was awarded to the Mother, but the Father obtained significant access time of close to half of each week with the Children (from Sunday 9 am to Wednesday 9 am). Parties also retained joint interim custody of the 2 Children. Thereafter, Parties filed applications for the variation of children orders: the Father was seeking shared care and control and other terms and the Mother sought to tweak some terms of access. While shared care and control had not been ordered, the access terms were adjusted to facilitate coparenting. Counselling was also ordered for parties to facilitate co-parenting. Such children orders were made on 8 June 2020 (“<b>2020 Interim Order</b>”), 21 January 2021 (“<b>2021 Interim Order</b>”), and on 30 June 2022 (“<b>2022 Interim Order</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As Parties had a dispute in relation to a company that both Parties were involved with, the divorce proceedings, save for children issues, had been stayed in favour of High Court civil suit proceedings on 15 February 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties eventually reached a Settlement Agreement on 20 December 2022 (“<b>Settlement Agreement</b>”) which included the resolution of the matters in the High Court civil suit, and the Ancillary Matters in divorce. This Settlement Agreement included a term whereby parties were to record a consent order in relation to custody, care and control and access, which maintained the interim orders previously made. Shortly after the Settlement Agreement and after the High Cour civil proceedings had been withdrawn pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, there were alleged issues with compliance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 3 February 2023, the Father took out a further application to vary care and control: seeking shared care and control and further adjustments in relation to the terms for contact time (the “<b>2023 Variation Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     At a case conference on 21 February 2023, the Father indicated that he intended to honour the Settlement Agreement insofar as they pertained to the issue of division of matrimonial assets and the equal apportionment of parties’ share of the children maintenance they would pay for. However, the Father sought to be heard on the issues of custody, care and control and access and the quantum of the Children’s reasonable expenses. The Mother took the taking up of the Variation Application as a breach of the Settlement Agreement. Time was given to Parties to consider whether this repudiated the whole of the Settlement Agreement and how they intended to proceed. In any event, given the Father’s position, timelines had been fixed for the filing of Affidavits for the Ancillary Matters after the conclusion of the hearing of the 2023 Variation Application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 24 April 2023, I denied the Father’s request in the 2023 Variation Application for the variation of the orders to grant Parties shared care and control. However, I varied some terms of access to address issues in coparenting that had arisen (“<b>2023 Interim Order</b>”), which included the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(q</em>)     <em>During each parent’s contact time with the Children, they shall allow the Children to spend up to 1 hour per day (in aggregate) following-up with the necessary practice, rehearsal and/or homework for co-curricular activities organized by the other parent. Each parent shall be at liberty to provide the necessary equipment, instruments and/or material to the other parent for such practice, rehearsal and/or homework and shall facilitate such activities.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 26 April 2023, the Father sought to make further arguments in an email to the Court. The Father subsequently officially filed Further Arguments on 5 May 2023 and supplemented it with a further filing on 12 May 2023. The Mother objected to these further arguments and filed a response on 15 May 2023. A hearing was fixed on 29 May 2023 for me to consider whether or not to allow any such further arguments. On 29 May 2023, I denied the Father’s request for further arguments and then he filed an appeal on 9 June 2023 (“<b>Variation Appeal</b>”) within 2 weeks of that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parenting Co-ordination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As part of the 2023 Interim Order, a Parenting Coordinator was also appointed to for an initial period of 8 months with the costs to be shared equally between Parties. As there were some logistical issues with the choice of Parenting Coordinator, a further order was made for the appointment of a different Parenting Coordinator (the “<b>PC</b>”) on 10 July 2023. Hence, it took some time for Parties to commence parenting coordination and their 1<sup>st</sup> meeting with the PC was conducted on 31 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     At a further case conference on 18 September 2023, the Father indicated that he had a positive experience during the 1<sup>st</sup> session with the PC and was seeking for the Ancillary Matters and the Variation Appeal to be held in abeyance, pending the completion of the parenting coordination. While the Mother was fine with the adjournment of the matter, she was desirous of a Draft Consent Order to be entered into based on what parties agreed. However, the Father was not keen on this. The matters were thus adjourned to 28 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the case conference on 28 November 2023, based on the counselling report received and Parties’ updates to the Court, there appeared to be positive progress. Thus, matters were further adjourned to another case conference on 19 February 2024, at which, Parties confirmed that parenting coordination was going well and that the only outstanding issues for the Ancillary Matters were for the children custody, care and control and access orders. Additionally, while Parties agreed to an equal sharing of children maintenance, what such reasonable maintenance (in terms of quantum and permissible items) was yet to be determined. The Father was desirous of seeking the PC’s assistance to resolve all of these outstanding issues. It was clarified that this was not within the original mandate of the PC, but that Parties were at liberty to engage the PC privately to try to mediate the matter and reach an agreement. The Father then indicated that he would be withdrawing his Variation Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 14 March 2024, a counselling report was received and on 20 March 2024, the PC provided reporting on the progress of Parties. Hence, a review hearing of these matters was conducted on 25 March 2024. It was updated that Parties agreed to the Father’s withdrawal of the Variation Appeal with no order as to costs and a notice of discontinuance was being filed. Parties also updated that they had arranged for a mediation session to be conducted, on 9 April 2024, with the PC, as an accredited family mediator. Good progress was noted in the various reports and confirmed by Parties. The PC recommended a further term of parenting coordination, which Parties were agreeable to. I thus made a further interim order to tweak some wording on access terms for better clarity, to further appoint the same Parenting Coordinator for a further 8-month period and for parties to attend further counselling (“<b>2024 Interim Order</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     However, subsequent to the 2024 Interim Order, the PC had to attend to some urgent family matters that had only just arisen, which prevented her from conducting the mediation session with Parties on 9 April 2024. Parties updated this to the Court in the next case conference on 25 April 2024 and sought further time to try to resolve matters amicably. Hence, the matter was adjourned for another case conference on 15 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On 15 July 2024, the Father sent an urgent email to indicate that he was unable to attend the case conference as he had to bring Parties’ son to the hospital. He updated that due to the PC’s personal circumstances, she was unable to conduct the mediation session and Parties had decided to engage another senior family law practitioner from her firm, who was actually the 1<sup>st</sup> choice as a parenting coordinator (the “<b>Mediator</b>”), to conduct the mediation on 1 August 2024. The Mother’s counsel attended the case conference and confirmed the same. The matter was thus adjourned to 5 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ disputes after a term of successful parenting coordination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On 5 August 2024, the Mother filed a notice of acting in person before the case conference. At the case conference, Parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     updated the Court that the mediation did not proceed as planned. The Mother claimed that the Father had unilaterally cancelled mediation and that Parenting Coordination could no longer continue;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father claimed that this was not completely accurate. He recounted that Parties had met on 3 May 2024 at the Mother’s solicitor’s office to discuss an amicable resolution of the matter. Then on 17 May 2024, the Mother and Father met personally without lawyers to make proposals, but they could not reach an agreement. Then on 22 June 2024, Parties attended a joint counselling session. The Father claimed that certain agreements had been reached at this counselling session. On this basis, the Father volunteered to write in on this. He first wrote to the PC on 27 June 2024 and then forwarded the email to the Mediator on 28 June 2024. This email purportedly included the alleged agreements reached in counselling. A day before the planned mediation, on 31 July 2024, the Father claimed that the Mother sent in a Mediation Statement which reneged on the purported agreed terms. Such correspondence was all done on a WP basis. Hence, the Father decided to call off the mediation as the agreed terms were not being honoured;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother informed that Court that while the PC had certain family matters to deal with, she had offered to continue to help with their family situation, but that the Father refused such offer of parenting coordination. The Father’s position was that it was unconscionable to make the PC continue with the sessions due to her family medical emergency. The Mother claimed to have offered to appoint someone else as a Parenting Coordinator, but this was refused too. On the issue of the counselling session mentioned by the Father, the Mother claimed there was no purported agreement, but just that there were 2 conditions as to how to discuss the matters in mediation. It is notable, that the Mother did state that there were 2 agreements initially, but when asked to clarify, she explained that they were conditions for mediation and not agreements on issues as alleged by the Father. The Mother stated that the Father had used certain language against her in the counselling session that the counsellors felt that it was no longer safe for there to be any further joint counselling sessions to be conducted with the Father and her;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Court informed Parties that there was applicable case law on whether the Court can consider WP correspondence on an alleged agreement, and this could be heard with the Ancillary Matters. Parties were asked to consider the law on this;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Father then first broached the issue that the Mother had purportedly used blackmail and statements that were not in the best interest of the Children in the WP correspondence. He was insisting that this needed to be deal with separately and before the Ancillary matters hearing. He was thus directed to file a summons application in this regard. This was unless there was an agreement between Parties to let such evidence in but that would have involved the Mother waiving such privilege. In response to this, the Mother confirmed that she would not be waiving any such privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Given the conflicting recount of events provided by the respective Parties, the Court indicated that we would be checking with both the counsellors and the PC to confirm their positions on these allegations; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_g\"></a>(g)     I also directed that if the matter was not resolved, that the Father was to file and serve his summons by 19 August 2024, with the Mother would have to file and serve her reply affidavit by 2 September 2024 and the Father to file and serve his final response affidavit by 16 September 2024, in preparation of a hearing of the matter fixed on 23 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On 6 August 2024, the Mother sent an email to the Court insisting that the PC appointed in March 2024 continue on and that the Father was in breach of the 2024 Interim Order. The Court replied on 7 August 2024 that the Father should be sent the email as well and that Parties were reminded not to litigate by correspondence. On 12 August 2024, the Mother reappointed her solicitors and filed a notice of appointment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As the Court received an update from the counsellors, an urgent case conference was fixed on 15 August 2024, to see if providing an update on this would help clarify matters for Parties. At this case conference:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I updated the Parties that the counsellors’ position was that in the joint face-to-face session with the Father and Mother: “<em>[t]he children's care and control matter was mentioned in the session by Father, who wanted shared care and control. There was no discussion and agreement on this matter as they were encouraged to discuss it in the mediation session.</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Notwithstanding this, the Father maintained that an agreement had been reached during this session. The Father also indicated that he was still intending to file the application for the admission of the alleged WP correspondence that had went beyond the scope of any purported agreement on the basis that there was improper conduct of the Mother (and not Mother’s counsel) in such WP correspondence;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As the Mother’s counsel was unsure what the alleged WP correspondence that the Father was referring to, she suggested that the Father could write to them to identify it so that they could take instructions and hopefully resolve the matter amicably on whether such evidence could be admitted, without agreeing that it was blackmail or improper conduct;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Hence, I gave the following directions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father was to send correspondence to the Mother’s Counsel on a WP basis on this and the Mother was to reply by the next day to state whether there was an agreement on admitting the alleged correspondence or not. If there was no agreement, the previously set directions for the filing of the summons by 19 August 2024 and the directions for the follow-up filings would still stand;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Affidavits of Ancillary Matters were to be filed by 26 September 2024, in the event that Parties agreed to the admission of the correspondence in question; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Parties were to write in by 22 August 2024 to update the Court on whether there was any agreement to the admission of the correspondence, and whether more time was needed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s Counsel then updated that the PC was actually willing to carry on with the parenting coordination sessions and that this updated status was as of 6 August 2024. The Father indicated that if the PC’s situation had improved, that he would be happy to continue with the parenting coordination. In the circumstances, I asked Parties to check with the PC and confirm whether the parenting coordination was to proceed and to write in to the Courts by 22 August 2024 on this issue. I also thus adjourned the timeline for filing of any summons in relation to the issue of admission of WP correspondence to 22 August 2024 in the event that there was no agreement on proceeding with parenting coordination and holding matters in abeyance pending the outcome of that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The circumstances relating to SUM 2661</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     On 21 August 2024, the Father filed SUM 2661 with a supporting affidavit, which did not address whether he was in agreement to proceed on with parenting coordination with the PC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On 22 August 2024, the Mother filed an Other Hearing Related Request (“<b>OHRR</b>”) to the Court stating that on 15 August 2024, the Father had written to the PC copying the Mother, seeking clarification on her continuing with parenting coordination sessions. On 19 August 2024, the PC responded to inform parties that she has “<em>since resumed [her] zoom meetings in between [her] medical appointments and [her] visits to San Fransisco</em>”. The Mother sought clarification from the Court in the OHRR as to whether the timelines for the summons should be held in abeyance notwithstanding that the Father had filed SUM 2661. Then later in the evening on 22 August 2024, the Father sent an email to the Court stating, amongst other things, that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“… 3. With limited time to think with this sudden development, the Court suggested, and parties agreed that if parenting coordination resumed, then timelines for the summons for adducing &quot;without prejudice&quot; evidence would be stayed. This made sense at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    However, given the evidence let ad [sic] paragraph 23 - 43 of my affidavit filed yesterday under FC/SUM/2661/2024 there is no basis to delay timelines. The evidence shows that the Plaintiff has no interest in achieving the objectives of parenting coordination but more keen on wasting everyone's time while running a coordinated charade while trying to restart legal proceedings against me in the civil arena.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    The Plaintiff should not be given multiple chances to sweep evidence under the carpet while readjusting her story.  Therefore, I submit that the timelines for FC/SUM/2661/2024 should stand.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Court replied urgently on 23 August 2024 to both Parties’ correspondence that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“The contents of the Plaintiff’s OHRR are noted. The Parenting Coordinator has indicated a willingness to recommence the Parenting Coordination Session over Zoom and the Court has also corresponded with the Parenting Coordination on the sought clarification. In the circumstances, kindly file a further OHRR or letter to Court to confirm whether both the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant agree to continue with such Parenting Coordination Sessions. Upon the receipt of such confirmation, the timelines provided for contested proceedings on 15 August 2024 would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Parenting Coordination and the hearing on 27 September 2024 will be vacated. This would also include staying the Defendant’s FC/SUM 2661/2024 until the conclusion of the Parenting Coordination, for further directions on the summons or for the summons to be withdrawn at such time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">However, the Defendant has sent an email on 22 August 2024 at 6.16 pm stating a change in position that he is now desirous of proceeding with FC/SUM 2661/2024. If there is no agreement on keeping timelines for contested proceedings in abeyance for Parenting Coordination, the previous directions shall stand and the hearing on 27 September 2024 shall proceed, unless otherwise directed. The Court will take parties’ conduct in proceedings into consideration for any decision on the outstanding matters.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     On 30 August 2024, the Mother filed a further OHRR that Parties were agreeable to continue with the parenting coordination sessions with the PC and that one had been scheduled for 2 September 2024 and thus SUM 2661 should be held in abeyance. The Court replied on 31 August 2024 that given the Father’s position taken in his 22 August 2024 email, that the Court required confirmation from the Father that he is in agreement to hold SUM 2661 in abeyance and sought that the Mother’s counsel confirm this. There was no reply on this. I also directed a Court Officer to contact Parties on the matter on 10 September 2024. In this regard, the Father informed the Court that he was desirous of the hearing on 27 September 2024 to stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On 20 September 2024, the Father filed his Written Submissions, Bundle of Authorities and a Notice of Intention to refer to affidavits filed in prior summonses. Later, also on 20 September 2024, the Mother then filed her reply affidavit in SUM 2661. Then on 24 September 2024, the Mother filed her notice of intention to refer to affidavits from prior summonses. A day after, on 25 September 2024, the Mother also filed her written submissions and bundle of authorities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The 1<sup>st</sup> initial hearing of SUM 2661 &amp; the admission of the Mother’s Affidavit filed late</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     SUM 2661 was first heard on 27 September 2024. At this hearing, the Father took objection to the Mother’s Affidavit as it had been filed out of time. He stated that he had asked the Mother’s Counsel, on Friday, 13 September 2024, whether they were ready to exchange submissions at the stipulated time. They only indicated back that they would be filing their reply affidavit on Tuesday, 17 September 2024 and that if there were issues, to take it up with the Court at this hearing. The Father complained that they had provided no explanation for their delay and had not requested for an extension of time. Even though the Mother indicated that she would be filing a reply affidavit, it is noted that the Father still went ahead to file his written submissions before having sight of the Mother’s reply affidavit on 20 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I questioned whether the Mother had taken sight of the Father’s Written Submissions before filing her reply affidavit. The Mother’s counsel indicated that his Written Submissions had been forwarded to the Mother by one of her colleagues at about 3.19 pm on 20 September 2024, but that the Mother’s reply affidavit was finalized before reviewing these Written Submissions and nothing was altered before the affidavit was executed. The remotely executed affidavit was sent back to the Mother’s counsel at 4.31 pm. The Mother’s counsel also informed the Court that she had not reviewed the Father’s Written Submissions before the filing of this affidavit. I accepted the Mother’s Counsel on this explanation. On the face of the Mother’s affidavit, there did not appear to be any portion that was a direct reply to the Father’s arguments in the Written Submissions and the Father could not point to any specific point that he believed was a direct reply. The Father however, included in his Written Submissions a whole portion of about 6 paragraphs (about 1 out of 13 pages) on the argument that based on a civil proof of standard, that given that the Mother failed to adduce any evidence, the balance was tipped in the Father’s favour for SUM 2991.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Mother’s counsel explained that there was some confusion on their end as to whether SUM 2661 was proceeding as planned or not, given that the Father had indicated on 15 August 2024 that he was willing to proceeding with parenting coordination with the PC and thereafter the PC confirmed her willingness to continue facilitating matters for Parties. Additionally, Parties had attended a parenting coordination session on 2 September 2024. A further session had also been arranged on 8 September 2024, which eventually did not proceed purportedly because the Father reneged on certain alleged agreements and the Mother felt that it was no longer fruitful to proceed with Parenting Coordination and sought that the Court make further decisions on the matter. It was only on 13 September 2024, when the Father sent correspondence to the Mother’s Counsel to check whether Parties were on track for the exchange of submissions, did the Mother’s Counsel check back with the Mother and realized that the parenting coordination was no longer proceeding. Only then did they start preparing the work to file the Mother’s reply affidavit. This was however, notwithstanding the Court’s repeated replies to correspondence to get the Father’s confirmation on holding timelines in abeyance and the Court Officer’s call on 10 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I asked the Father whether the prejudice caused by not having the opportunity to review the Mother’s reply affidavit before the filing of his Written Submissions could be cured by allowing him to file his final response affidavit and thereafter to be able to file further submissions and for a costs order to be made in his favour. The Father could only highlight that his “<em>tactical advantage</em>” would be gone if I were to direct this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the circumstances, I found that the appropriate step to best serve the justice of the case would be to allow the Mother’s Affidavit and adjourn the hearing to 6 November 2024 and give directions for the Father to file his final response affidavit by 9 October 2024 and then for Further Written Submissions which could include rebuttals to be filed by either side by 30 October 2024. I relied on the judge-led approach to cure the irregularity of the Mother’s late filing of her reply affidavit, as there were certain positions taken after the last hearing on whether Parties would proceed with further parenting coordination instead of pursing this summons, which could have led to some confusion and a delay in compliance with timelines.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Father duly filed his final response affidavit on 9 October 2024 and thereafter filed his 2<sup>nd</sup> set of Written Submissions and a Bundle of Authorities on 30 October 2024. The Mother opted not to file any further Written Submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing of SUM 2661 &amp; Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Parties then appeared on 6 November 2024 for the full hearing of SUM 2661 for half a day. Even though I had already decided on the issue of the admission of the Mother’s Affidavit, the Father sought to rehash his arguments. I allowed him to make brief statements for the record but refused to change my position on the admission of the Mother’s Affidavit. The Father exceeded his allotted time for brief statements and had to be reminded to wrap up so that the substantive issues could be fully ventilated in the hearing. As Parties took the full half day to complete their oral submissions, I reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I had initially intended to go through my decision with Parties on 13 January 2025 where a hearing had been fixed for decision and costs arguments. However, upon Parties’ requests, I agreed to deliver my decision by way of a Registrar’s Notice prior to this hearing. I originally indicated that the judgment would be released in the week of 16 December 2024, however, as I had taken ill before then, I only managed to release the Brief Grounds of Decision on 31 December 2024. Parties were kept updated on the delay in the release of this decision. As disclosed to Parties in the Brief Grounds of Decision, I dismissed SUM 2661 in whole with reasons provided, which are also largely reproduced in this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The appeal &amp; costs hearing for SUM 2661</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On 6 January 2025, the Mother requested for an extension of time to file costs submissions by 9 January 2025 instead of 6 January 2025 as previously directed as the Brief Grounds of Decision had only been released on 31 December 2024. The Court replied on the same day agreeing to this extension of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father then proceeded to file his Notice of Appeal, FC/RAS 1/2025 (“<b>RAS 1</b>”) on 8 January 2025 on the basis that he was “<em>[a]ppealing against the whole decision made in FC/SUM 2661/2024 to (1) disallow evidence to be admitted and (2) allowing the Plaintiff late filed affidavit into evidence.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     On 9 January 2025, the Mother filed her written costs submissions, but no written costs submissions were submitted by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I then saw parties to hear the issue of costs on 13 January 2025. After considering the arguments, I awarded the Mother costs of S$3,000 for the dismissal of SUM 2661 and a further disbursement of S$125.80 on a standard party-and-party basis. However, for the costs wasted for the adjournment of the hearing on 27 September 2024, I awarded the Father, who was unrepresented, costs of S$500 to cover his disbursements and him seeking a consultation with a lawyer and his LawNet access to obtain case law that was wasted in having an adjournment. I also granted liberty to Parties to set off between these 2 costs orders. So, effectively the Father was due to pay the Mother a sum of S$2,625.80. The decision on costs is elaborated below at paragraphs 69 to 85.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In SUM 2661, the Father applied for “<em>[a]n order that the [Father] be at liberty to rely on the written proposal the [Mother] issued the Defendant on 31 July 2024 marked “without prejudice” in this action, on the ground that the “without prejudice” marking is vitiated under the blackmail and/or unambiguous impropriety</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father alleged that in the lead-up to mediation scheduled on 1 August 2024, the Mother made proposals in WP correspondence on 31 July 2024 that in the Defendant Father’s opinion would “<em>unwind existing court orders as well as reverse all the progress made with the parenting coordination sessions</em>” and that such proposals would ultimately “<em>be harmful to the Children who are aged 8 and 6.5 years old presently</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Mother’s position was that SUM 2661 was wholly unmeritorious and should be dismissed with indemnity costs. The Mother alleged that the Father was “<em>simply trying to use a backdoor approach to introduce WP correspondence for case building purposes and this runs contrary to the efforts made by the Wife in good faith to try resolve all the Ancillary Matters amicably in the interests of the children</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Given the Father’s position stated in RAS 1, the 2 central issues to be determined in this decision are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Court should have allowed the Mother’s Affidavit to be admitted, even though it was filed out of time; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Court should pierce through the WP privilege to admit WP correspondence from the Mother on the basis that it was unambiguous impropriety and/or blackmail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue: Admission of the Mother’s Affidavit filed late</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As stated above, this matter was 1<sup>st</sup> heard on 27 September 2024. where the Father raised issues about the Mother having filed her reply affidavit out of time after the Father had filed his 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions. His argument was that the Mother’s affidavit should be wholly expunged and, on that basis, given that she adduced no evidence to refute the Father’s case, there was nothing to controvert his position stated and SUM 2661 should be granted in his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     After hearing parties’ arguments, I accepted that the Mother’s counsel’s representation that she had not reviewed his Written Submissions prior to finalizing the Mother’s reply affidavit. I held that the appropriate remedy would be to allow the Father to file his final reply affidavit and then both sides be given the opportunity to file further submissions, which would include rebuttals. I relied on the judge-led approach to cure the irregularity of the Mother’s late filing of her reply affidavit, as there were certain positions taken after the last hearing on whether parties would proceed with further parenting coordination instead of pursing this summons, which could have led to some confusion and delay in compliance with timelines. In this manner, the Father was not prejudiced and that any delay could be compensated in costs, if any. This allowed the matter to be heard substantively after the filing of the relevant affidavits and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In the case of <b><em>BRZ v BSA </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25247-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 17</a></b>, the High Court clarified at [24] that the Court has the power to cure irregularities under rule 10(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014, and should only not exercise this when:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     curative approach would result in prejudice;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     where the nature of the error is serious or fundamental that it cannot, in principle, be validated;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     where the mandatory nature of the rule breached may be construed as excluding cure;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_d\"></a>(d)     where the rule is sufficiently comprehensive to govern non-compliance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_e\"></a>(e)     where the substantive application, if made, would have failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In this case, there was no issue relating to the limbs stated above at (b), (c) and (d). With regard to (a) and (e), the prejudice caused to the Father was cured by his ability to file a final response affidavit and further submissions and also for costs wasted due to the delay in the hearing to be compensated by a costs order. If a substantive summons had been filed for this, I would have also similarly reached the same decision. Hence, I found exercising the judge-led approach in this manner to cure the late filing of the Mother’s Affidavit to be fair and just in the circumstances of the case and to allow the actual dispute to be fully ventilated, instead of allowing the Father to have, in his words, a “<em>tactical advantage</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father was notified of the Mother’s intention to file her reply affidavit late prior to his filing of his 1<sup>st</sup> set of Written Submissions. Yet, he still filed and served his Written Submissions before the Mother filed her reply affidavit. There was nothing on the face of the documents that the Mother had been able to plug any gaps in her evidence by reviewing the Father’s 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions prior to the filing of her reply affidavit. I accepted the Mother’s counsel’s representation on when the submissions were sent to the Mother and when the executed affidavit was sent back to the Mother’s Counsel. Within this brief window of time, there was little opportunity to adduce new evidence to be stated in the affidavit, and moreover, the Mother’s Counsel had informed the Court that the affidavit had been finalized before the Father’s 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions having been filed. The Father also could not point to any particular portion of the Mother’s reply affidavit that suggested that it was in response to his 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Additionally, while the Mother should have been more proactive in seeking the Father’s confirmation on whether timelines for SUM 2661 were being held in abeyance, the Father’s waffling position on parenting co-ordination was confusing. The Father had proceeded with parenting coordination even though he had already filed SUM 2661, but eventually ceased any further sessions, even though such further parenting coordination was mandated by the 2024 Interim Order and timelines for SUM 2661 were meant to be held in abeyance if Parties were engaging in such parenting coordination. The Court seeking that the Mother to confirm whether the Father was agreeable to hold timelines in abeyance was due to the conflicting positions that the Father took, which also made it unclear to the Court as to whether the hearing of SUM 2661 was proceeding or not. Hence, I had to direct the Court Officer to contact the Father on 10 September 2024 to clarify this point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on WP Privilege</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     With regard to the crux of Sum 2661, the Father relied on the case of <b><em>Unilever Plc v The Procter &amp; Gamble Co </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/20644-E-M.xml')\">[2000] 1 WLR 2436</a></b> (“<b><em>Unilever</em></b>”) where the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”) Court of Appeal (“<b>CA</b>”) in the Chancery Division laid out 8 exceptions to when a WP proposal would have its privilege removed and made admissible and relied specifically on the 4<sup>th</sup> exception that “<em>the exclusion of the evidence would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other “unambiguous impropriety”</em>”. The Singapore Court of Appeal in <b><em>Quek Kheng Leong Nicky and Another v Teo Beng Ngoh</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/63165-M.xml')\">[2009] SGCA 33</a> (“<b><em>Nicky Quek</em></b>”) adopted this ruling that the admission of WP communications is subject to a number of exceptions as set out in <em>Unilever</em>. In <em>Nicky Quek</em>, the Singapore CA went on to analyse the exception where WP communications are admitted to determine whether there was a compromise reached, and if so, what were the terms of such compromise. The 4<sup>th</sup> exception to prevent blackmail or other “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>” had yet to be analysed in any reported cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The CA, however, in <b><em>Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA &amp; Ors </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21824-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 894</a></b> (“<b><em>Ernest Ferdinand</em></b>”) observed that this exception would be a vexing question, which the CA did not find it necessary to rule on, in that case, given that there was insufficient evidence of a genuine intention to negotiate. The CA did opine that it would be a balancing act where, albeit in reference to correspondence between lawyers, “<em>[o]n the one hand, the integrity of the legal profession, and fairness to the parties with whom solicitors deal, requires that no amount of ingenuity of language be permitted to cloud the court’s view of what is, in substance, an improper threat or other improper communication</em>”, and “<em>[o]n the other hand, it may be unduly stifling to free and robust negotiation between disputants if any mention of possible criminal or reputational consequences could defeat “without prejudice” privilege</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Mother argued that SUM 2661 should be dismissed in light of Section 139B of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “<b>WC</b>”) that evidence of anything said, any document prepared, or information provided in the course of any attempt at reconciliation or mediation, counselling or family support program under Division 4 of the WC would not be admissible in any court. In this regard, I would have to agree with the Father that this did not mean that the common law precedence on the exceptions to WP privilege would not apply. As correctly pointed out by the Father, prior to the introduction of this portion of the WC, WP correspondence was also excluded by section 23 of the Evidence Act 1893 (“<b>EA</b>”). The cases of <em>Nicky Quek</em> and <em>Ernest Ferdinand</em> were both examined with the backdrop of section 23 of the EA. The Family Courts have also consistently considered the exceptions of WP privilege, particularly when it comes to circumstances where a party alleges that an agreement had been reached through such WP correspondence. In the alternative, the Mother argued that, pursuant to the holding in <em>Ernest Ferdinand</em>, WP correspondence would only not be protected by WP privilege if they were shown not to be bona fide and this threshold was a high one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     This case thus turned on whether Unilever’s 4<sup>th</sup> exception to WP Privilege was applicable. The Father cited the case of <b><em>Motorola Solutions Inc v Hytera Communications Corpn Ltd </em></b><b>[2021] EWCA Civ 11</b> (“<b><em>Motorola</em></b>”), where the UK CA analysed what amounted to an “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>” for the exception to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In <em>Motorola</em>, the claimant had obtained a judgment for sizeable damages against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in the United States and sought a domestic freezing order in the UK. The claimant alleged that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets on the basis of the evidence of statements allegedly made by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s former chief financial officer during WP settlement meetings to the effect that if the claimants obtained a judgment in the US proceedings which was unacceptable to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, then the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would take steps to transfer its assets away from Western jurisdictions in order to make enforcement of the judgment difficult. The judge at 1<sup>st</sup> instance held that such a threat, if made, amounted to an “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>” and thus the exception applied. This was even though the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant denied making the threat, it was deemed sufficient to render the statements admissible that there was a good arguable case that they had indeed been made as alleged. However, the UK CA allowed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s appeal. It was observed that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>” was only applied in truly exceptional cases where the WP privilege was abused and there was no scope for dispute about what had been said – this would be a circumstance where the statement had been recorded or it was in writing; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)     in determining whether this exception applied, it was wrong in principle to ask whether one party’s disputed evidence, if true, demonstrated an unambiguous impropriety, or on an interim application, to ask whether there was a good arguable case of such impropriety. Instead, it was necessary to ask whether the evidence established an “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The UK CA held that although a threat to transfer assets to a third party otherwise than in the ordinary and proper course of business in order to render a judgment unenforceable might in some circumstances amount to an “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>”, whether it would do so would depend on the facts of the particular case. Hence, the judge at 1<sup>st</sup> instance was “<em>wrong to hold that it was sufficient for the admission of the statements that the claimants had established a good arguable case as to what was said at the meetings in question and wrong to have gone on to pose the question whether, if the claimants’ evidence as to what was said was true, that amounted to unambiguous impropriety; that, on the facts, the evidence did not establish an unambiguous impropriety such as to give rise to the exception to the without prejudice rule; and that, accordingly, the without prejudice statements should not have been admitted and the freezing order fell to be set aside</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The evidence presented in Motorola entailed a photograph of a flipchart on which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s former chief financial officer had illustrated his remarks showing 2 options: “<em>appeal</em>” and “<em>retreat</em>” in the event of an unacceptable verdict at trial. The UK CA accepted that on face value, there was an allegation of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant threatening to move assets out of the claimant’s anticipated reach. However, the “<em>retreat</em>” strategy was presented as an alternative to an appeal (which itself was perfectly proper) and that the specific courses of action identified as part of the retreat strategy (i.e. reduce cash of subsidiaries and introducing a shorter payment or credit terms) involved no impropriety and had legitimate business purposes. Additionally, it was held that even if the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did cease business in western jurisdictions, it would open the field to the claimant, who might be expected to welcome such a retreat). Hence, the UK CA found it difficult to see why this should be characterised as improper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Moreover, while the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s evidence did not dispute the words on the chart, their account was not consistent with the claimant’s. The UK CA held that if the claimant’s evidence was plausible, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s evidence was at least equally so. On the state of the evidence, it was found that it was impossible to say that the evidence established an unambiguous impropriety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Father argued that the summary of the principle holdings in <em>Motorola</em> for the 4<sup>th</sup> exemption in <em>Unilever</em> to apply to this case was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_a\"></a>(a)     there cannot be any scope for dispute about what had been said [about the blackmail or unambiguous impropriety], either because the statement had been recorded or because it had been in writing; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that, in determining whether the exception applied, it was wrong in principle to ask whether one party’s disputed evidence, if true, demonstrated there was a good arguable case of such impropriety and that rather, it was necessary to ask whether the evidence established an unambiguous impropriety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Hence, in this case, given that this is the Father’s application, he bore the burden of proof to prove his case beyond a balance of probabilities that the statement made was incontrovertible (provided in recording or written form) and that the evidence provided must show that there was “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>”. It is noteworthy that this opinion by the UK CA is only persuasive and not binding as there has been no pronouncement of adoption of this in any higher court in Singapore. However, as noted by the UK CA, allowing WP correspondence to be admitted on the basis of the <em>Unilever</em>’s 4<sup>th</sup> exception, would be exceptional.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The question is whether the circumstances in this case rise up to the level required that made it so exceptional that such WP correspondence should be admitted on this premise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law Applied to the Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     With regard to whether there were incontrovertible statements made, I agreed with the Father that there was written documentation of what the purported WP Proposal by the Mother was. The question was whether such proposals amounted to blackmail and/or unambiguous impropriety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In the case of <em>Ernest Ferdinand</em>, the CA appeared to suggest that unambiguous impropriety would include an “<em>improper threat or other improper communication</em>”, such as, potentially a “<em>mention of possible criminal or reputational consequences</em>”. Hence, threatening to initiate criminal proceedings or the embarking of a defamation campaign against someone if they were not to agree to certain terms in WP correspondence could very well amount to unambiguous impropriety, which the Courts should not protect under a WP privilege. In the <em>Motorola</em> case, it was alleged that a threat was made to pull out of the relevant markets such that the other party would not be able to enjoy the fruits of a favourable decision. However, even in that case, the UK CA did not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the statements made were unambiguously improper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In this case, the correspondence in question was a proposal made by the Mother that the Father was of the view was not in the Children’s best welfare. Specifically, the proposal appeared to seek a rolling back of certain orders made for the follow-upon activities assigned by the 1<sup>st</sup> parent while they are with the 2<sup>nd</sup> parent (i.e. the 2023 Interim Order, the relevant portion having been produced at paragraph 12 above). There does not appear to be any allegation of a threat, thinly veiled or otherwise. The Mother’s proposal, even if it was contrary to the prior orders relating to the follow-up for the Children’s studies and cocurricular activities, would represent an attempt to vary the prior orders. It is commonplace in a large number of cases involving children issues for proposals to be made to vary access or custody orders for the Children. Each side that makes a proposal may view their proposal to be in the best interest for the Children, and could, in certain circumstances, amount to differing parenting styles of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As discussed with Parties in the hearing on 6 November 2024, there could, however, very well be a circumstance in family proceedings where perhaps, in a relocation application, a party threatens to take the children away from the other parent, regardless of how the Court decides, in an attempt to extract further concessions from the other parent, where this would be similar to the types of threats described in cases such as <em>Motorola</em>, i.e. whereby one party is threatening to deny the other party the fruits of successful litigation in an attempt to gain more favourable terms. However, this was absent from this case. The Father argued that the Courts should not apply that level of the test in <em>Motorola</em> to the current case, as the claimant in <em>Motorola</em> was seeking a freezing account, whereas none was being sought here. Instead, when questioned on what the applicable test should be in the context of such children issues cases, the Father posited that if the Court had after reviewing the evidence, determined certain shortcomings and limitations and thereafter addressed that through an order of court to correct such issues, making proposals to dismantle such previously made orders would be unambiguously improper. This is unless, evidence can be shown that such proposals would be in the best interest of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Father argued that as the Mother had failed to explain why her statements were not an unambiguous impropriety, that the Court should side with him to apply this 4<sup>th</sup> exception from <em>Unilever</em> to admit such WP proposals into evidence. That appears to shift the burden to the Mother, when it is the Father, as the applicant, who has to prove his case on the basis of a balance of probabilities. Moreover, if this were to be the requirement, that would necessitate all WP proposals made by a parent to state the reasoning of such proposals. This is not something that has been practised and the introduction of such a requirement may unnecessarily encumber WP negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Furthermore, in testing the applicability of such a test proposed by the Father to a typical case, where, for example, the Court may have ordered joint custody of the children, which has been widely accepted to be in the best interest of the children in most cases barring any exceptional circumstances, and a parent may propose to the other parent in WP correspondence to seek a variation of such prior orders to grant them having sole custody. According to the Father’s test, this WP proposal, in and of itself, would amount to unambiguous impropriety, unless the party can evidence that it is made in the best interest of the children. If that were the case, then the filing of an application to vary joint custody to sole custody in most cases would be deemed “<em>unambiguously improper</em>” by the Father’s standard and consequentially, the making of any WP proposal prior to making such an application would also be deemed as “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>”. I agree with the Mother that based on this rather low bar of a test, it would unreasonably open up the floodgates to admit a wide variety of WP proposals on children’s issues and would stifle the intent behind encouraging parties to try to reach amicable resolution of matters through WP correspondence. As acknowledged in <em>Ernest Ferdinand</em>, the application of the 4<sup>th</sup> exception in <em>Unilever</em> would require exceptional circumstances, and what the Father has set out, would definitely not be exceptional circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Court may very well not agree with the proposals that a party makes in relation to the custody, care and control and access to the Children, however, the making of such proposals to each other in WP correspondence, even if it seems to the other parent not to be in the best interest of the Children, cannot amount to “<em>unambiguous impropriety</em>”. What one party believes to be in the best interest of the children may not be what the Court ultimately decides is such best interest of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In the circumstances, I found that the Father had failed to discharge his burden of proving that the purported proposals made by the Mother amounted to unambiguous impropriety and/or blackmail such that they should be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding that they had been made in the context of WP correspondence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties Arguments on Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Mother sought that the Court make an order for costs against the Father on an indemnity basis. She argued that the Father had improper motivations and that his conduct, in general, was to just to frustrate the Mother and prolong proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Mother highlighted the CA case of <b><em>BTN v BTP </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26282-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 603</a></b> (“<b><em>BTN</em></b>”) that held at [8] the usual course is to award a successful litigate party and party costs on a standard basis and costs on an indemnity basis is dependent upon there being exception circumstances to warrant a departure from the usual course. As pointed out at [15] of <em>BTN</em>, examples of exceptional circumstances include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where the action is brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression for other improper purposes;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the action is speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Where the action amounts to wasteful or duplicative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The Mother also further relied on the High Court decision of <b><em>VVB v VVA </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27020-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 1</a></b> (“<b><em>VVB</em></b>”), where the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong held that an award of costs is one way for the Court to signal that “<em>adversarial stances are not acceptable in a family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Additionally, the Mother referred to the case of <b><em>CSW v CSX </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27616-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 47</a></b> (“<b><em>CSW</em></b>”), whereby the Learned District Judge Patrick Tay held that improper motivations are relevant to costs, including costs on an indemnity basis. This includes applications for PPO which are oftentimes driven by a mix of motivations, some proper and others improper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Applying such case law, the Mother argued that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father had no basis for his application, it was wholly unmeritorious as evident from the outcome of the application determined by the Court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s conduct in pursuing SUM 2661 was simply a backdoor approach to introduce WP documents for case building purposes i.e. to gain an advantage in the Ancillary Matters proceedings on the issues of custody, care and control and access. SUM 2661 not only ran contrary to efforts by the Mother to resolve the Ancillary Matters in good faith but was clearly taken out for improper purposes and an abuse of process;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given that the contents of the WP settlement proposals and the arguments by the Father about the Mother purportedly blackmailing or conducting herself with unambiguous impropriety, which was denied, even taking the Father’s case at its highest that he was able to satisfy the Court that these allegations were made out, such allegations would have ultimately no relevance to the Ancillary Matters and the children’s issues. These proceedings were therefore wasteful and an abuse of process; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father’s ultimate aim was also to frustrate the Mother, cause her to incur unnecessary time and costs and delay the conclusion of the Ancillary Matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Moreover, even though the Father was in person, the Mother emphasized that the Court should not afford him too many liberties. In the circumstances, the Mother was seeking costs of S$12,000 with disbursements of S$125.80. I sought the Mother’s arguments on the appropriate quantum if costs were to be ordered on the standard basis. She argued that costs of S$3,500 with additional disbursements would be appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The Father objected to costs orders being made on an indemnity basis and proposed that a costs order of S$1,500 with additional disbursements would be appropriate in these circumstances, and that the Court should grant him a costs order of S$1,000 for the costs of adjourning the hearing on 27 September 2025 for further filings. Hence, the nett result that the Father was seeking was a costs order of S$500 with additional disbursements to be paid to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Father claimed that SUM 2661 involved a novel point of law, and while it was determined that his case did not meet the standard required that it was not taken out for any proven ulterior purposes. Additionally, it was the Mother who was late in complying with timelines for the filing of the affidavit and thus delayed matters further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Mother countered that they had been trying to save costs by only proceeding to do further work when it was finally confirmed that the Father was unwilling to continue with the parenting coordination. The Mother pointed out to the various applications taken out by the Father for variation of orders for children’s issues and now SUM 2661 as well as the various High Court civil proceedings to exemplify his deleterious conduct to frustrate the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Decision on Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Having considered Parties’ arguments, I held that the circumstances of the case did not rise up to the level necessitating the making of a costs order on an indemnity basis. I found that there was insufficient evidence that had been presented to prove that the Father had taken out SUM 2661 with ulterior motives. The Father’s case involved a novel issue of the exceptions to the WP privilege. That being said, while the issue in law was novel as there had been no reported decisions really expounding on this exception cited in <em>Unilever</em>, the Father’s case fell far short of any alleged unambiguous impropriety or blackmail required to attract such an exception. However, falling short of the required standards, does not prove that the Father knew that he had no case and had pursued SUM 2661 for other ulterior purposes. Moreover, had the Father been successful in admitting such evidence, it may have had some relevance on the issues of whether the Father or the Mother was more appropriate to have care and control or to have shared care and control. Overall, I could not say that the Father’s conduct was so improper to attract indemnity costs. While the Father had taken out multiple summons applications, this was the 1<sup>st</sup> summons taken out by the Father since 2023. And while there could have been an overall delay in proceedings, such costs should be considered for the hearing of Ancillary Matters and not specifically for this summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     For the adjournment of SUM 2661 from 27 September 2024 to a hearing on 6 November 2024, the benchmark for the adjournment of a special half day hearing would be between S$500 to S$1,500. This is usually awarded on the basis of the cost of legal representation. In this case, The Father was in-person but had argued that he spent about S$700 for LawNet access and consulting lawyers on his case over meals. However, even if I were to accept that, the cost expended on that cannot be wholly attributable to the costs of the adjournment. The costs that should be considered would only be the wasted costs in not being able to argue the case on the basis that the Mother had failed to provide any evidence which did form a relatively substantial portion of the Father’s 1<sup>st</sup> Submissions. Additionally, there was also some further work that perhaps needed to be done to consider the Mother’s reply affidavit after it had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     I could appreciate there was some confusion on the Mother’s part as the Father took the position that he was open to attend parenting coordination sessions, which should have held timelines in abeyance, but at the same time he was also insisting that SUM 2661 to be heard according to the previously set timelines. However, it should have been clear to the Mother that the Father’s filing of the application and subsequent correspondence indicated that he no longer agreed to hold timelines for SUM 2661 in abeyance. Additionally, the Court’s replies to the Mother’s OHRRs and the call by the Court officer on 10 September 2024, should have further highlighted the need to work expeditiously on the Mother’s reply affidavit for the hearing of SUM 2661.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Moreover, even if we consider that the Mother was hoping to save costs for further parenting coordination sessions to proceed, by 8 September 2024, where the Father no longer was willing to proceed with the 2<sup>nd</sup> parenting coordination session, the Mother should have duly updated her counsel on the need to start work on the reply affidavit and not wait till a few days after to inform her lawyer of this when the lawyer had to call her up to take instructions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Taking that all into consideration, I found that the costs order of S$500 (all in) for this adjournment of the 27 September 2024 hearing was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     With regard to the costs for SUM 2661 itself, the benchmark costs for a substantive half-day hearing would be between S$800 to S$4,000. In this regard, I noted that the Mother’s request for a costs order of S$3,500 was not unprecedented as I had made a similar costs order in favour of the Mother on the dismissal of one of the Father’s prior variation applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In this case, while there was not as much spent on the evidence, there was a novel point of law that needed to be delved into and the Father also rehashed arguments on the admission of the Mother’s reply affidavit to have them placed on the record, when its admission had already been previously decided. He also exceeded his allotted brief amount of time to just state his position for the record and insisted on carrying on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Taking into account the totality of the work done for the hearing, I awarded costs of S$3,000.00 for the dismissal of SUM 2661 and disbursements of S$125.80 payable by the Father to the Mother. The nett result of considering both costs orders, which I gave Parties the liberty to set off, was a sum of S$2,625.80 was payable by the Father to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Overall, while the Father presented a novel point of law to consider in relation to a less common exception to the WP privilege, the Father’s case fell far short of any alleged unambiguous impropriety or blackmail. Even though the Father was not formally trained in legal analysis, the history of proceedings and his access to case law and lawyers to consult should have guided him to be more circumspect in the type of applications to proceed with. It is evident that Parties have been embroiled in matrimonial litigation for an extended period of time and there appears to be some level of inequity that the Mother has to incur further legal costs to defend against the Father’s applications, when the Father pursues such applications, in-person, which are ultimately deemed as unmeritorious and delay proceedings even further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     It is sad that the progress achieved in working towards coparenting for almost a year in the parenting coordination sessions was done away when the PC was momentarily unavailable to assist Parties due to her personal circumstances, which were indeed very serious and warranted her taking time off. I do have to commend the PC for her work on this case but have deliberately left out her name to give her and her family privacy and space in their time of adversity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The ordering of parenting coordination in this case was a measure taken after multiple prior interventions were unable to get the Parties to effectively coparent. Regardless of the current state of their relationship, as parents, the Parties need to find a way to coparent appropriately. Neither party can only insist on their way being the absolute right way and discount the other parent’s views. I can only hope that Parties will consider the best welfare of the Children moving forward, find a way to cooperate for the sake of the Children and not needlessly take out applications which would invariably prolong proceedings. The overall conduct of Parties, including any refusal to proceed with parenting coordination sessions with the PC ordered by the Court, even after she had made special arrangements to accommodate Parties, will be considered in the subsequent Ancillary Matters hearing.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil procedure – Privileges – Without prejudice privilege"],"date":"2025-03-21","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2360 of 2021 (Summons No 3461 of 2024)","title":"XKH v XKI","citation":"[2025] SGFC 34","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33060-SSP.xml","counsel":["Paul (Cross Street Chambers) for the plaintiff","Yong Hong Kit Clement (Beyond Legal LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-04-04T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Allen Chong","html":"<root><head><title>XKH v XKI</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XKH <em>v</em> XKI </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33060-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 34</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2360 of 2021 (Summons No 3461 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">21 March 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Allen Chong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Paul (Cross Street Chambers) for the plaintiff; Yong Hong Kit Clement (Beyond Legal LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XKH — XKI </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Privileges</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Without prejudice privilege</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">21 March 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Allen Chong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The present application in FC/SUM 3461/2024 (“SUM 3461”) is the plaintiff’s application to expunge paragraphs and phrases in the defendant’s affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (the “Impugned Paragraphs”), which was filed in support of his summons application in FC/SUM 3028/2024 (“SUM 3028”). SUM 3028 is, in turn, an application to vary an earlier court order (<em>vide</em> FC/ORC 3595/[xx]) to insert amended clauses to said order concerning make-up access, school holiday and overseas access and other matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       According to the plaintiff, the Impugned Paragraphs ought to be expunged because they reference communications made in the course of without prejudice meetings between the parties and with their respective solicitors in attendance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Applications to expunge references in affidavits which ought to be excluded as a matter of law under doctrines such as without prejudice privilege are routinely encountered in the Family Justice Courts. As to the issue of without prejudice privilege, it is uncontroversial that communications between parties which are made on a without prejudice basis in the course of negotiations for a settlement are inadmissible: <em>Quek Kheng Leong Nicky and another v Teo Beng Ngoh and others and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0181.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 181</a> (“<em>Nicky Quek</em>”) at [22]. Nonetheless, I issue my written judgment to the extent that it contains useful discussions on the scope of without prejudice privilege and the applicability of the “delay exception” to the present proceedings. Specifically, I discuss the proper limits to the application of the delay exception, finding that a workable touchstone for when this exception may be invoked is that of <em>relevance</em>, <em>ie</em>, is delay even a <em>relevant</em> question such that without prejudice communications should be admitted to provide an explanation for said delay?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The existence of a distinct privilege in the matrimonial context extending to communications received in confidence with a view to matrimonial conciliation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As a preliminary matter, I am cognizant that the present case is raised in the context of <em>matrimonial</em> proceedings. I am also aware that there is a suggestion in the literature that the basis of privilege over communications in the course of negotiations in matrimonial disputes stems from an <em>analogous</em> privilege rather than without prejudice privilege <em>per se</em> as it has developed in the civil cases. I refer to the observations of the learned author of Ian Dennis, <em>The Law of Evidence</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell: 2017, 6th Ed) at para 9-043:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Finally, an analogous privilege protects communications with a conciliator in matrimonial disputes. [citing <em>Pais v Pais</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/65964-E-M.xml')\">[1971] P. 119</a>; <em>Re D (Minors)</em> [1993] Fam. 231.] This again is founded on public policy considerations; the law is concerned to encourage spouses to settle their differences and achieve reconciliation if possible, and additionally there is an important concern with the welfare of any children involved. <em>The law here is still in the process of development and may not have exactly the same scope and limits as the usual “without prejudice” privilege.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Indeed, the existence of this analogous privilege was referred to by Walker LJ in <em>Unilever Plc v Procter &amp; Gamble Co</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/20644-E-M.xml')\">[2000] 1 WLR 2436</a> (“<em>Unilever</em>”) at 2445:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(8)    In matrimonial cases there has developed what is now a distinct privilege extending to communications received in confidence with a view to matrimonial conciliation: see <em>In re D. (Minors) (Conciliation: Disclosure of Information)</em> [1993] Fam. 231, 238, where Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. thought it not</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“fruitful to debate the relationship of this privilege with the more familiar head of ‘without prejudice’ privilege. That its underlying rationale is similar, and that it developed by way of analogy with ‘without prejudice’ privilege, seem clear. But both Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone and Lord Simon of Glaisdale in <em>D. v.

In this connection, I note also the comments of the learned author of Colin Passmore, <em>Privilege</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell: 2020, 4th Ed) (“<em>Colin Passmore’s Privilege</em>”) at para 10-269 as to why this analogous head of privilege in matrimonial contexts even falls to be considered as an exception to the without prejudice privilege. Walker LJ’s rationale for including this head of privilege as an exception to without prejudice privilege was left unexplained, and the author found the inclusion of this privilege as an exception strange as “it is clear that this mediation privilege will be enforced save in the most exceptional cases.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As such, I proceed on the basis that without prejudice privilege applies in the present case.

On 16 May 2024, the PPO Suit was withdrawn upon me giving a written undertaking not to commit family violence against the Plaintiff and the Child. At the WP meeting, Parties also negotiated on the child-related issues post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The defendant argues that without prejudice privilege does not apply to paragraph 7. The paragraph seeks to merely inform the Court and provide the context for the variation application in SUM 3028 that without-prejudice negotiations took place regarding the personal protection order suit and that the parties settled this suit after the negotiation meeting. The paragraph does not go so far as to reference the contents of the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     From paragraph 7, it is clear that two facts are referenced: (a) that the parties had engaged in negotiations on a specific date, 29 April 2024, and (b) that the parties had negotiated on the <em>topic</em> of child-related issues post-divorce. I refer to these facts as “7(a)” and “7(b)” below for my analysis in the next section.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">References to dates of negotiations are protected by without prejudice privilege</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As to 7(a), an issue arises as to whether the dates of negotiations are protected under the rule of without prejudice privilege. While references to the <em>date</em> of a negotiation that took place are admissible, this appears to be rationalised as falling within the exception to without prejudice privilege rather than such dates falling outside the scope of the privilege altogether.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>Walker v Wilsher</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/39156-E-M.xml')\">(1889) 23 Q.B.D. 335</a> (“<em>Walker</em>”) at 338, a case frequently cited for the proposition that without prejudice communications can be admitted in rebuttal of a suggestion of delay, Lindley LJ held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">No doubt there are cases where a letter written without prejudice may be taken into consideration, as was done the other day in a case in which a question of laches was raised. <em>The fact that such letters have been written and the dates at which they were written may be regarded, and in so doing the rule would not be infringed.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To my mind, this statement is ambiguous. It is unclear if Lindley LJ’s statement is premised on the position at law that the dates of negotiations having taken place do not fall to be protected by without prejudice privilege <em>or</em> that such dates fall to be protected by without prejudice privilege but would otherwise attract the delay exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Some clarity may be sought from the case of <em>The Leasing Number 1 Partnership v Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs</em> 2015 WL 7693020. This is a case originating from the First-Tier Tribunal Tax Chamber, a tribunal in the UK dealing with appeals against decisions made by Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”) relating to issues such as income tax, corporation tax and customs duty. In that case, HMRC sought costs after the appellant partnerships withdrew their appeals. HMRC needed to prove the partnerships had acted unreasonably during the proceedings to succeed. HMRC argued that the partnerships could have and should have withdrawn their appeals much earlier and that failing to do so was unreasonable. The partnerships countered that it was reasonable to maintain their appeals whilst engaged in settlement discussions with HMRC. HMRC acknowledged that the negotiations and correspondence with the partnerships had taken place during that period but contended that this communication was without prejudice and thus inadmissible as evidence in the costs application. It was in this context that Judge John Brooks dealt with the issue of issue to determine whether the partnerships were able rely on the negotiations and correspondence to demonstrate the reasonableness of their behaviour. In doing so, His Honour considered the exceptions to the without prejudice rule as laid down by Walker LJ in <em>Unilever</em> ([5] <em>supra</em>). His Honour held thus:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Mr Maugham contended that the circumstances of this case fell within the fifth of the exceptions of Robert Walker LJ [<em>ie</em>, the exception relating to delay/acquiescence] as such evidence would explain the delay, which HMRC allege was unreasonable, by the Partnerships in withdrawing their appeals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is clear that the discussions and correspondence between HMRC and the Partnerships were a serious and genuine attempt to compromise the dispute between them and therefore was on a without prejudice basis. It is also clear that there was no agreement between the parties that such evidence be admitted as is often the case...in respect of costs... However, given the obvious restriction on the ability of the Partnerships to demonstrate their reasonableness in not withdrawing their appeals sooner if they were prohibited from relying on negotiations and correspondence between them and HMRC and that this evidence was sought to be adduced to explain delay I considered that it did fall within the...exemption in <em>Unilever</em> and directed that although such evidence could be admitted it should be <em>limited to the fact that there had been correspondence and negotiations between the parties and the dates, but not the content, of such correspondence and negotiations.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     From the excerpt above, Judge Brooks appears to have proceeded on the basis that not only did the correspondence and negotiations between the parties fall <em>exceptionally</em> to be admitted under the delay exception, but also the dates of such negotiations and correspondence. If this is the implication of this decision, I find that negotiations dates fall to be covered by without prejudice privilege. I appreciate this might be a draconian finding given the practice in many cases where parties refer the court’s attention to the fact and dates of negotiations having taken place, particularly negotiations in the Family Dispute Resolution Division of the Family Justice Courts for the purposes of matrimonial proceedings. In my view, this practice is justified on the basis that parties have agreed unanimously to waive the application of without prejudice privilege over such information – <em>eg</em>, by way of non-objection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus proceed on the basis that the defendant’s reference to the fact that the parties had engaged in negotiations on a certain date, 29 April 2024, falls to be protected under the scope of without prejudice privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">References to topics of discussion in negotiations are protected by without prejudice privilege</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As to 7(b), a question is raised on whether the fact that parties had negotiated on the <em>topic</em> of child-related issues post-divorce falls to be protected by without prejudice privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Before the English Court of Appeal’s seminal decision in <em>Unilever</em> ([5] <em>supra</em>), there was some debate about whether the privilege only protected <em>admissions</em> made during negotiations. <em>Unilever</em> adopted a broader view, holding that the without prejudice rule protects the <em>entirety</em> of genuine settlement negotiations, not just specific admissions. This means that even statements that are not direct admissions, but form part of the negotiation process is generally inadmissible. The rationale behind this is to allow parties to speak freely and explore settlement options without fear that parts of their discussions might be dissected and used against them later. As observed in <em>Unilever</em>, parties cannot speak freely if they have to constantly monitor every sentence: <em>Unilever</em> at 2449. This broad protection aims to foster open and honest dialogue conducive to settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The High Court, in its detailed grounds of decision in <em>CSO v CSP and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29281-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 24</a> (“<em>CSO</em>”) (at [49] to [76]), has held that the broad approach in <em>Unilever</em> applies in Singapore. I need not traverse the same reasons save to state that <em>CSO</em>, being a High Court authority, is binding on this Court. I accordingly adopt the broad approach to without prejudice privilege in determining whether the topics of discussion at negotiations fall to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In this connection, the court will objectively construe a communication as a whole in the context of the factual circumstances to determine if without prejudice privilege attaches: <em>Cytec Industries Pte. Ltd. v. APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd.</em> [2009] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 769 at [16]. This implies that the <em>entire</em> substance of the communication is under scrutiny for privilege. While the cases do not appear to explicitly state that the topics of discussion are separately privileged from the content, it is logical that revealing the topics discussed during without prejudice negotiations could in some cases indirectly disclose the parties' positions, potential concessions, and the nature of the dispute they were trying to resolve. This could undermine the very purpose of the privilege, which is to encourage open and honest dialogue aimed at settlement without fear of later repercussions in court. For example, if it were permissible to disclose that the “topic” of a specific financial adjustment was discussed, even without revealing the amounts or offers, it could still reveal a party's willingness to consider that aspect of the dispute, potentially prejudicing their position should negotiations fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The view that references to topics of discussion are protected is consistent with the rationale underlying the broad approach, which is to further the public policy objective of encouraging settlements. The broader approach’s protection over the <em>whole</em> of without prejudice communications should thus readily be extended to confer protected over the topics of discussion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     This finds some support in the High Court case of <em>CSO</em>, where in considering the applicability of the “Delay/Acquiescence Exception” (as it is referred to there), Andre Maniam J appears to have proceeded on the assumption that negotiations on the <em>topic</em> of payments to be made (and not the contents of this discussion) is protected by without prejudice privilege (see <em>CSO</em> at [27] and [33]). Since the question of whether the exception applies is logically <em>posterior</em> to the question of whether without prejudice privilege applies in the first place, His Honour’s consideration on the exception's applicability would thus suggest that the reference to the topics of a discussion can be protected by without prejudice privilege. For context, I reproduce His Honour’s analysis at [33] of his grounds of decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    In the present case, the first defendant could minimally rely on the narrow form of the Delay/Acquiescence Exception to say that in the period of 17 to 21 February 2020, the plaintiff and the first defendant were engaged in “without prejudice” negotiations <em>regarding the payments to be made by the first defendant to the plaintiff</em>. That would go some way towards rebutting the plaintiff’s second Assertion that the first defendant had not taken issue with the plaintiff being paid the retention money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Therefore, I find that the defendant's disclosure that they had negotiated on child-related issues after the divorce <em>falls within</em> the protection of the without-prejudice privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Paragraphs 14, 39 and 49 are protected by without prejudice privilege</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The paragraphs sought to be expunged are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"18.7%\"><col width=\"81.3%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Impugned Paragraphs</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Extract</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(in italics and bold)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whole of paragraph 14</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>Although I had requested for a make-up access clause to be included into the terms of settlement for the by-consent variation application during the WP meeting, the Plaintiff was not agreeable.</em></b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whole of paragraph 39</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>Importantly, I note that this was not something that Parties could agree on at the WP Meeting.</em></b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whole of paragraph 49</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>I note that while this was a clause that Parties had discussed on during the WP Meeting, we were not able to reach an agreement on the same.</em></b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As to paragraphs 14, 39 and 49, the defendant’s case is essentially that these paragraphs set out the topics and not the contents at the meeting and thus fall outside the ambit of without prejudice privilege.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As I have held above concerning paragraph 7, the topics of discussion fall under the protection of without prejudice privilege. In any event, these paragraphs clearly must be read together with the preceding paragraphs, and their inclusion may thus even be said to be a direct reference to the parties’ points of disagreement during the negotiations. This would undoubtedly fall to be protected by without prejudice privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Paragraphs 8 and 27 are protected by without prejudice privilege</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To recapitulate, the impugned portions of paragraphs 8 and 27 are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"18.7%\"><col width=\"81.3%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Impugned Paragraphs</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Extract</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(in italics and bold)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Phrase in paragraph 8</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">On 31 July 2024, I commenced a by-consent variation application (FC/SUM 2421/2024) to vary the Order of Court FC/ORC 740/[xx] dated 13 January 2022 and the Order of Court FC/ORC 5775/[xx] dated 13 December 2022 <b><em>based on the terms that Parties could agree upon at the WP Meeting</em></b>.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Phrase in paragraph 27</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>While I had initially agreed to varying clause 1(1) to clause 1(k) at the WP Meeting in order to provide a more predictable schedule for the Child and the Plaintiff</em></b>, I believe that this factor has to be balanced with my ability to actually have access with the Child especially in light of the unforeseen circumstances that are out of my control.

While not directly setting out what was agreed upon at the meeting, paragraph 8 indirectly alludes to the contents of the terms agreed to during the meetings when it stated that the by-consent variation application was “based on” these agreed terms. Similarly, paragraph 27 also goes into the defendant’s reasons for why he had initially agreed to varying Clause 1(1) to Clause 1(k).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For completeness, I deal with the defendant’s submission that he has chosen to waive his privilege vis-à-vis paragraph 27.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The defendant contends that he has waived his privilege to disclose that, during a without prejudice meeting, an agreement was reached to modify Clause 1(1) to Clause 1(k). However, I find that such unilateral waiver is not permissible. In <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Lippo Marina Collection Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20456-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHC 140</a> (“<em>Lippo Marina</em>”) at [104], Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) endorsed the view that without prejudice privilege is shared by <em>all</em> parties involved in the negotiations. Consequently, without prejudice privilege can only be waived if all parties to the settlement negotiations agree. This principle is based on the rationale that allowing any single party to unilaterally use or disclose privileged information would undermine the “safe haven of confidentiality” afforded by the privilege: <em>Lippo Marina</em> at [106].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     To summarise, I find that all the paragraphs and/or phrases referred to in the Impugned Paragraphs are subject to without prejudice privilege. The remaining question is whether the defendant can rely on the delay exception to admit them into evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Does the delay exception apply to the Impugned Paragraphs to nonetheless allow for their admission as evidence?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevance is the touchstone for the invocation of the delay exception</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As held in <em>CSO</em> ([24] <em>supra</em>) at [77], the exceptions to without prejudice privilege set out by Walker LJ in <em>Unilever</em> ([5] <em>supra</em>) at 2444–2445—which includes the delay exceptions—were accepted as part of Singapore law by the Court of Appeal in <em>Nicky Quek</em> ([3] <em>supra</em>) at [23]. Thus, whether the broad approach in <em>Unilever</em> to the scope of without prejudice privilege is the position in Singapore, the same exceptions accepted in <em>Nicky Quek</em> apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The novel question for this court’s consideration is: <em>What are the limits to applying the delay exception?</em> The reported cases and academic commentary do not go much further than stating that without prejudice communications may be admitted to explain delay or apparent acquiescence. Is it the case that simply because delay <em>might conceivably</em> be raised as an issue at a hearing, a party is thereby conferred the license to pre-emptively include references of without prejudice communications to pre-empt any concerns of delay on his part? Yet, as a matter of judicial economy and logic, there must be limits to the admission of without prejudice communications in such circumstances. Else, without prejudice communications could almost always be admitted under the guise of explaining away any concerns of delay, real or imagined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     To answer the question of what limits is appropriate for the scope of delay exception, I find it helpful to survey the cases where without prejudice communications have been admitted allowing a party to explain their delay include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>Applications to strike out for want of prosecution.</em></b> This is a primary example where the delay exception is frequently invoked. Courts consider whether there has been an inordinate and inexcusable delay in progressing a case, and the fact (and sometimes the content) of without prejudice negotiations can be presented to explain periods of inactivity: see <em>Family Housing Association (Manchester) Ltd v Michael Hyde and Partners</em> [1997] 1 WLR 354.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><em>Cases where allegations based on laches are raised.</em></b> When a party is accused of laches in causing unreasonable delay that prejudices the other party), the fact and timing of without prejudice negotiations may be relevant to demonstrate that the delay was due to genuine attempts to settle and not a lack of diligence. The court may review the correspondence to ascertain the attitude of the parties with regard to the progress of the case and which party, if any, was responsible for the delay: Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2020) at para 15.010. It is also apparent from the excerpt of Lindley LJ’s observations in <em>Walker</em> above at [17] that it has been the practice of the English courts since at least 1889 that where the question of laches is raised, without prejudice communications may be raised in response.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b><em>On an issue of delay in amending a patent.</em></b> Similar to general arguments of laches, if there's a delay in seeking to amend a patent or pursuing other claims, and this delay is challenged, evidence of without prejudice negotiations aimed at resolving the underlying issues may be admissible to explain the reasons for the delay. The case of <em>Redifusion Simulation Ltd v Link Miles Ltd</em> [1992] FS.R. 195. illustrates this. The plaintiff sought to amend its patent, and the defendant objected based on the plaintiff’s delay in the making of the application. The plaintiff responded by referring to discussions during prior without prejudice ADR that it intended to apply for leave to amend to explain the delay. The judge hearing the defendant’s motion to strike out the relevant passages from the plaintiff’s affidavit that the plaintiff’s case for including the passages was “arguable”, leaving the question of admissibility to the trial judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The survey of the case law above point to relevance as being the touchstone for the invocation of the delay exception. Some guidance may also be found from Walker LJ’s remarks in <em>Unilever</em> that occasionally, fuller evidence is <em>needed</em> to give the court a fair picture of the rights and wrongs of the delay: <em>Unilever</em> at 2444–2445. Thus, a potential touchstone could be found in the court’s assessment of whether such evidence is <em>needed</em>. Or stated more directly, is the issue of delay <em>relevant</em> such that evidence of without prejudice communications is required to explain away such delays? I find this to be a workable criterion for cases where the delay exception may be invoked. In this connection, I echo the views of the learned author of <em>Colin Passmore’s Privilege</em> at para 10-210 that the exception should be “confined to applications where delay is <em>relevant</em> – which means, in practice, that the occasions on which it can be used are few” [emphasis added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     When then can delay be said to be relevant? While it is not possible to particularise exhaustively the myriad circumstances in which the touchstone of relevance could potentially be satisfied, I am of the view that it can minimally be said that delay would be relevant in cases where the question of delay has been <em>put into issue</em>. That relevance includes a situation where the question of delay has been put into issue is supported by the High Court case of <em>CSO</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In <em>CSO</em> ([24] <em>supra</em>), the plaintiff had made two assertions by way of a supporting affidavit in the context of the plaintiff’s application for an injunction against the first defendant from receiving payment on the basis that the first defendant’s call on a guarantee was unconscionable. Of the two assertions, the assertion which is material for our purposes of our discussion of the delay exception was that the first defendant did not take any steps to extend a letter of credit (“LC”) which the first defendant had procured in favour of the plaintiff, pursuant to which certain sums would be paid to the plaintiff for the plaintiff’s performance of a supply contract (<em>CSO</em> at [13(a)]). In the face of this assertion, Maniam J found (at [34]) that that was an appropriate case where fuller evidence was needed to give the court a fair picture of the rights and wrongs of the delay (or inaction). The plaintiff had made the assertion that the LC had not been extended because the first defendant had not taken any steps to extend it. Thus, and more materially, Maniam J found that the fact of the plaintiff having put the allegations of delay into issue meant that this warranted a response from the first defendant (at [36]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Given that the plaintiff had <b><em>put in issue</em></b> the reason for the LC not being extended (<em>ie</em>, the rights and wrongs of the delay/inaction), the first defendant should be allowed to respond by showing that in the course of “without prejudice” negotiations <em>it had proposed to extend the LC, but the plaintiff had opposed that extension</em>, and that is why the LC was not extended. If the first defendant were limited to referring to the dates and fact of negotiations about payments, the court would not have a fair picture of why the LC had not been extended</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold and italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     To my mind, the fact that the plaintiff had put into issue the question of delay was what created the nexus of <em>relevance</em> between the question of delay and a party’s reliance on without prejudice communications in explanation of said delay. If such a question was not even put into issue, it is difficult to see how delay would be of relevance to require the admission of without prejudice communications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Without circumscribing the myriad of ways in delay can be put into issue, I am able to at least say that delay would be put into issue where an allegation of delay is <em>inherent</em> within the nature of the application itself such as applications to strike out for want of prosecution, or where the question of delay has been raised by the other party (or, as one may reasonably foresee, the Judge).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The question of delay is not relevant in SUM 3028 to allow for the admission of without prejudice communications</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In the present case, the defendant’s case for why reference should be made to the Impugned Paragraphs is two-pronged:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, on 31 July 2024, both parties filed a by-consent variation application <em>vide</em> FC/SUM 2421/2024 (“SUM 2421”). However, a mere two months later, on 23 September 2024, the defendant filed SUM 3028, a contested variation application. Given the short interval between these two applications, the defendant deemed it prudent to provide an explanation to the court by way of his affidavit in SUM 3028 to explain the rationale behind this subsequent filing. The explanation lies in the fact that the parties had convened for a without prejudice meeting in the interim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, a District Judge had, an earlier case conference on 22 October 2024, queried “why are there so many summonses in this case?” This is really a submission that the question of delay has been put into issue by the Judge and which therefore requires an explanation by the defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I cannot see how the question of delay had been put into issue. I agree with the plaintiff that there was no live question of delay that required any explanation. From my understanding of the plaintiff’s submissions, the plaintiff does <em>not</em> take issue with any delay on the part of the defendant. To the contrary, the plaintiff has insisted that there was <em>no</em> delay. It was evident that the defendant had wasted no time in taking up the variation application <em>vide</em> SUM 3028 on 23 September 2024 less than two months after the earlier by-consent variation application in FC/SUM 2421/2024 filed on 31 July 2024. Defendant counsel’s reliance on <em>CSO</em> (at [28]) that “delay” included not only belated action but also complete inaction also did not find favour with me. Again, I struggle to see how there was a delay which required the defendant’s explanation in the form of inaction, even in the broad sense endorsed in <em>CSO</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The defendant’s submission stands on firmer footing when he refers to the remarks of the DJ on 22 October 2024 “why are there so many summonses in this case?” to suggest that the question of delay had taken on relevance since it had been put into issue by the Judge. I would record that the notes of evidence of the case conference are not before me as evidence for the purposes of this application. As such, I do not have the full context as to why the DJ made the remarks that she did and whether her comments were intended to raise any concerns of delay, which called for an explanation from the defendant. In any event, I struggle to see how the remarks, which appear to be directed at the number of summonses filed in the <em>divorce case</em>, raise a concern regarding any delay in the filing of SUM 3028 <em>specifically</em>. I do not think the admission of without prejudice communications is necessary for the defendant to respond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In light of the above, I do not find that the defendant can avail himself of the delay exception to admit the Impugned Paragraphs, which are covered by without prejudice privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I allow the present application in SUM 3461 and order that the Impugned Paragraphs be struck off and/or expunged from the defendant’s affidavit filed on 23 September 2024 in support of SUM 3028.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The defendant is directed to file the affidavit excluding the Impugned Paragraphs by 26 March 2025. If parties cannot agree on costs, cost submissions are to be filed and served by 2 April 2025 by way of an “Other Hearing Related Request”. These submissions are limited to 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I thank parties for their submissions and assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Supporting Affidavit of [XKI] dated 23 September 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit in SUM 3461 at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>FC/SUM 3461/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Reply affidavit of [XKI] at paras 12, 18 and 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defendant’s Closing Submissions dated 18 February 2025 in SUM 3461 at para 23.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Mental Capacity Assessments – Functional and clinical components – Declarations – Estoppel"],"date":"2025-03-14","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSM 310/2023","title":"XJD v XJE and others","citation":"[2025] SGFC 24","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33055-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant in Person","Darren Ng Zhen Qiang, Lee Lyi Shyuenn, Marina Chin Li Yuen and Teo Su Ning, Gillian (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the 1st Respondent","Muk Chen Yeen Jonathan and Tan Kah Wai with intern Liew Xi Ting (LVM Law Chambers) for the 2nd and 3rd Respondents","Tan Jun Hong (instructed) and Tan Shen Kiat, Litigation Representative (Kith and Kin Law Corporation) for the 4th Respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-04-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XJD v XJE and others</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XJD <em>v</em> XJE and others </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33055-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 24</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The request for such an assessment was also made in a previous set of proceedings in HC/OA 637/2023 (OA 637). The request in OA 637 was primarily refused because P was not made a party to those proceedings. Under the provisions of a will, P’s late husband appointed P and the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent who was a close friend, as executrices of his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After medical evidence was given for the hearing before me, and a week before submissions were due, the applicant sought to amend the originating summons to include a declaration that the renunciation P made on 6 September 2022 is null and void. I permitted it as I was of the view that the amended prayer was rooted in the evidence of the medical experts and the respondents had the opportunity to address this sufficiently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       While the core issue in this case was the mental capacity of P at the time she renounced her rights to administer the estate of her late husband, it in effect sought to have this court ignore or review the decision of the court in OA 637, which a Family Court clearly was not in a position to do. Further, any declaration that P had no mental capacity to renounce her rights to administer her late husband’s estate would necessarily mean that P had no capacity to therefore administer the estate. The applicant was of the view that such a result should have no bearing on the need to declare her lack of capacity. The futility of the request however, threw light on his motivations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Having heard from all parties, I dismissed the application against which the applicant appeals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       P is the mother of the applicant (her son) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents (her daughters). P participated in proceedings as the 4<sup>th</sup> respondent and was represented by a litigation representative, a lawyer in private practice. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent is a close friend of the deceased, a friendship dating back to the 1970s. The applicant appeared in person but I was informed that he has a law degree and worked in the UK for some years. He was as a result, well able to root his arguments in established principles of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       P’s husband passed away on 3 August 2022. His will was executed in 2014, and as mentioned, he appointed P and the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent as executrices and co-trustees. The will was read on or around 22 August 2022 and it was the position of the applicant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents that their mother was too old to engage in the administration of the estate and that consequently, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent should take on the role solely. P accordingly renounced her rights on 6 September 2022. Probate was extracted on 23 November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Separately, the applicant commenced an action against the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent in OA 637<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> to invalidate the appointment of an individual as liquidator of a company his deceased father and the larger family had shares in. He also sought to invalidate a special resolution passed on 16 March 2023 to wind up the company. The premise of the application was that P lacked capacity to sign the letter of appointment and director’s resolution on 2 February 2023 and a proxy form which was signed on 9 May 2023, authorising the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to vote on her behalf at an extraordinary general meeting. The applicant also sought that the High Court order an assessment to be conducted to determine P’s mental capacity. The High Court was of the view that the relevant evidence did not support the applicant’s assertion that P lacked mental capacity to sign the documents in question and further, that a medical assessment could not be ordered as P was not party to the proceedings. The medical evidence that was presented in OA 637 was provided by Dr PT who was the only one who had met P <em>and</em> conducted formal assessments of P’s capacity on 16 December 2022, 16 February 2023 and 6 February 2024. The applicant appealed against the decision of the High Court, and these were dismissed recently. One of the positions that was taken by the applicant in the appeal is that another doctor well qualified in geriatric psychiatry, Professor K, had reservations about the assessments of Dr PT and accordingly sought to adduce the report of Professor K. This was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the High Court (AD) referring to the futility of a “desktop review” of P’s mental capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The document under scrutiny in the case before me was P’s renunciation of 6 September 2022. The documents that were the subject matter in OA 637 were executed in 2023. The decision of the High Court, affirmed on appeal, accepted Dr PT’s evidence that P had mental capacity to execute the 2023 documents. This meant that the applicant in the case before me was effectively asking for a reconsider the same issue and medical evidence, save that the document in question was executed at a different time. It did not escape the respondents’ attention that this was an earlier document, making the exercise appear to be a second bite of the cherry. The Family Court has no jurisdiction to review the same material to address the same issue before the High Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I appreciated however that P was not a party to the proceedings in OA 637 which therefore prevented an order for a medical assessment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In the proceedings before me, P was made a party and hence the need for a medical assessment was a prayer this court was presented with to consider. I also appreciated the fact that the document in question is different from that which was before the High Court. In the context of fluctuations in capacity that is common in dementia, further information that the applicant may have wanted to produce to the court and which may throw light on P’s state of mind as at 6 December 2022 was therefore allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (MCA) was first enacted, it was with a view to expressing in legislation, the need to respect the autonomy of individuals to make their own decisions. Family members or caregivers need to refrain from quick assumptions of a complete lack of capacity especially amongst the elderly, every time there are memory lapses or unusual behaviour. S 3(2) provides for the presumption of autonomy rather than a presumption that one lacks it as a result of a particular condition.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Insofar as dementia is concerned, paragraph 4.3.2 of the Office of the Public Guardian “Code of Practice: Mental Capacity Act” (September 2023) provides that “<em>mental capacity must be assessed on a case by case basis and cannot be assumed based only on the person suffering from a particular medical condition</em>”. This practical guide is of great significance as it is common for those who care for or know of persons who have neurocognitive disorders to conclude, sometimes too quickly, that the person lacks mental capacity and cannot make any decision for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In the event a person loses mental capacity, steps may be taken by a family member to obtain an order to be appointed as a deputy to ensure that the life of that person continues to be well supported by the deputy, always bearing in mind the need to observe the dignity of that person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     S 5 of the MCA provides a framework to determine capacity or a lack thereof. An individual must be able to understand information related to the decision that needs to be made, retain the information, use or weigh the information as part of the process of making the decision and communicate the decision. One need not have to communicate in perfect grammar or complex sentences, nor does the retention of the information be for a long period [s 5(2)]. S 19 of the MCA empowers a court of law to declare that a person has or lacks mental capacity. The serious nature of such a declaration was expressed by the court in the seminal case of <b><em>Re BKR</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The test for capacity includes both the functional and clinical components. A court would need to evaluate the evidence with respect to an individual’s ability to decide and her cognitive ability to make a decision. In other words, if a person cannot make a decision (functional component) because of a mental impairment (clinical component which would be contingent on appropriate assessments by medical practitioners preferably in the field of psychiatry), a declaration of a lack of capacity may be made. But not otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was not disputed in this case that dementia becomes worse over time but that its fluctuating nature allows for some decisions to be made and relied upon, while some others would necessitate greater scrutiny and may be unsafe to endorse. It is time and decision specific.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Did P have functional capacity?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     P renounced her right to act as executrix of her husband’s will on 6 September 2022. This was done after the applicant, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents met with the lawyer who drafted their father’s and learnt that P and the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had been appointed executrices and trustees of the deceased’s estate. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents claimed that it was at this meeting that they and the applicant agreed that it was impractical for P who was about 81 years of age at the time to take on such an onerous role. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents claimed that the applicant did not state that P lacked mental capacity. The applicant however expressed that he had in fact voiced reservations about P’s mental capacity. I am of the view that the position expressed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents was a more accurate reflection of the position of all the siblings for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The applicant said that on 11 August 2022, he expressed that P did not have the mental capacity to renounce her rights in relation to an application for letters of administration which was taken out in Malaysia to administer the deceased’s Malaysian estate. At that point in time, the will was not retrieved. Even though he claimed that he was of this view in relation to Ps capacity, he signed on documents giving his consent to the application for a grant of letters of administration to be taken out by the 2nd respondent. His evidence was that he did so thinking that the documents he signed would have no legal effect since P had no capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I could not accept the explanation. It appears that the applicant while unsure of the capacity of his mother to forgo her rights to a Grant was comfortable enough to endorse documents enabling his sister to proceed with the matter. He revoked the consent only on 28 October 2022 well after the father’s will which dealt with Singapore assets was made known.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The applicant met with the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent at a dinner around the same day the will was read and no firm position was expressed in relation to P’s capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Soon after the will was read, a <em>WhatsApp</em> chat group was set up by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent who indicated to the siblings that given P’s frail state, she may not be in a position to perform her duties well. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent was advised to ascertain this and to assist in having P attend before a lawyer to ensure that P was capable of making the decision to renounce. The applicant did not voice any objection on record. He claims that he had conversations about his concerns but if true, the tenor of such conversations and the exact concerns remain unknown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent is not a beneficiary of the will and had nothing to gain from taking on this responsibility solely. As an executor and trustee, he owes fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries – the applicant being one of the beneficiaries - and would be accountable to them beyond obtaining probate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Between 26 and 30 August 2022, communication between the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent on arrangements for the renunciation to be signed was made on the chat group to which the applicant was privy and who took no issue. His repeated assertions that he expressed discomfort verbally is not supported by the evidence and even if he did have reservations, he did not act on it before the renunciation was in fact signed. This is likely because he too believed that his mother was expressing her desire not to be involved in the complex task of administering their father’s estate. The renunciation was made before a Notary Public in Penang after it was ascertained by the Notary that P understood what she was signing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evidence suggests that the first time the applicant raised objections to the renunciation signed by his mother was in an email addressed to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent on 30 November 2022. This was after the extraction of probate and soon after the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent informed the siblings of the proposal for the sale of the deceased’s home (property). This property is one where P and the applicant had stayed in before P moved to Penang in 2019 and which the applicant currently stays with his family. Under the provisions of the will, P, the applicant, the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup>,</sup> 3<sup>rd</sup> respondents and a child of the applicant stand to benefit from the proceeds of any sale of this property. The applicant made a proposal to his siblings for the property to be leased to him for a period of time and that the estate could collect the rent from him if he failed to leave the property after the proposed period. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent said that she would speak to P about it. The applicant appeared comfortable with the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent asking for the views of P, a position that is incongruous with the view that P lacks mental capacity to make decisions for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The challenges with respect to the disposal of the property raises the probability that the applicant was rather more concerned about having to move out than his mother’s capacity to renounce her rights as executrix/trustee. In fact, in his very first affidavit he sees the validity of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s appointment as sole executor to be dependent on P’s capacity to give a valid renunciation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Even if I were to accept the applicant’s position that P had no mental capacity to renounce her right, the result will be that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent will act as the sole executor and trustee as P would not be in a position to perform her duties. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent in the discharge of his duties, would need to ensure that all the beneficiaries receive their shares and that the property is sold to have this materialise. There is no evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent believed that P was cognitively unable to renounce. As stated in the Code of Practice, one cannot equate having a neurodegenerative disease with cognitive inability to make all decisions. Much depends on the state of health at the time in question to make the specific decision in question. Given that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was not in regular contact with P, to suggest that he knew P had no capacity to renounce her rights or that he had an ulterior motive in securing full control of the administration of his late friend’s estate, is unsupported.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>P was represented in these proceedings by a litigation representative (LR). The LR, a practising lawyer, has a duty to court to inform on the way instructions were obtained and the responses of P to questions asked. Two interviews were conducted on 5 July 2024. The first was at P’s residence in Penang from 10.15 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and the second at a beach resort from 4.30 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. The change of location was on account of renovation work at P’s residence. It was the position of the LR that P had at the time of the interviews expressed a clear position that she did not want to have anything to do with the administration of the estate of her late husband as it would involve travelling and activities she was not able to comfortably attend to.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> This indication was accepted as most of the questions that were posed by the LR were answered correctly. P was able articulate the following: that she has 3 children; the order of their births; where they reside; the date of the interview by pointing to it on a calendar; that she was a widow; that she used to live in Singapore; the address of the Singapore home and that she was being cared for by the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. She knew that her late husband had assets in Singapore and Malaysia – this was informed without any verbal prompts or visual references.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> She did make a few mistakes which appear insignificant, for example, in identifying the number of grandchildren during the second interview and the gender of all the grandchildren during the first interview. She was however largely consistent with her answers during both interviews. She articulated her responses in Mandarin and appeared relaxed. Given that these interviews were held in July 2024, the cogency of her answers as informed by the LR, supported the position that her renunciation in 2022 was made with cognitive awareness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Clinical Component</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The applicant essentially relied on reports by various health care professionals prior to the mental capacity assessment of P by Dr PT on 6 September 2022 as well as the opinion of Professor K on the manner of Dr PT’s assessment, to advance the argument that his mother could not have had the capacity to renounce her rights.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It was the applicant’s position that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent knew that P was on follow up reviews with a doctor at a hospital in Singapore and that she chose not to reveal this. It was also his position that their late father had informed the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent to consult doctors in Penang on the cognitive changes he observed of P while he was alive. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent confirmed that this was true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The applicant referred to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans done by a radiologist on 23 October 2019 where large lesions, moderate cortical atrophy, severe volume loss of hippocampus, substantial parietal atrophy and bilateral periventricular white matter lesions were observed. On 30 October 2019 a doctor at a hospital in Penang conducted the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in which P scored 27/30. The MoCA is a screening tool that evaluates cognitive function. On 11 September 2021, a geriatrician and physician in Penang diagnosed P with Alzheimer’s vascular dementia. Psychosis and mood symptoms of dementia were observed and medication given to regulate these. The MoCA reading was 17/30. On 24 December 2021, an occupational therapist had documented a score of 15/30.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The applicant submitted that the biological markers and the images of the brain scan especially of the hippocampus which regulates memory and cognition, proves that P was not functioning normally. This was not disputed by Dr PT who is the only doctor who assessed P’s mental capacity. He shared by drawing an analogy to a famous politician in Malaysia whom he had treated, that one could look normal but the brain scans show that functioning is impaired. The applicant then cited medical literature to show the impact of severe loss of volume of the hippocampus. This and Professor K’s opinion that severe loss of volume in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe atrophy suggests that dementia in P was no longer mild, were accepted. What I do not accept are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>All</em></b> the medical documentation prior to Dr PT’s mental assessment of P were produced in OA 637 and the Court in dismissing the suggestion that P had no capacity to sign on the documents which were the subject matter of that hearing, said “<em>However none of the above reports…demonstrated the impact of the mother’s dementia on her decision making or cognitive abilities</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The applicant did in essence, what he was cautioned not to do and that is, to attempt to relitigate the matter with the same material presented to the High Court. The applicant submitted that the answers Dr PT gave under cross-examination in the matter before me reveals inadequacies and inefficiencies which justify a declaration that P did not have the required capacity to issue a renunciation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Dr PT is a consultant neuropsychiatrist and Head of Neurobehavioral Medicine at a hospital in Penang. Any suggestion by the applicant that he is not qualified has no basis.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He has many years of experience and is by no means a doctor who was callous in his assessment. The only person that performed a mental capacity assessment is Dr PT. This was conducted on 16 December 2022, which is approximately 3 months after P had renounced her right to be an executrix of her late husband’s will. The fact that this assessment was to determine testamentary capacity does not detract from the fact that capacity was established. The ability to execute a will is by no means simple and requires sound executive functioning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The applicant expressed scepticism of the impressive scores that P received on the MoCA (26/30) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in which she scored 28/30. Professor K stated and in fact Dr PT accepted, that the leap of 9 to 10 points between 2021 and 2022 is impossible from a medical standpoint. Again, there was no dispute. The result in 2022 mirrored somewhat the 2019 reading of 27/30. While the applicant spent considerable time dissecting this, I did not believe that the assessment of Dr PT hinged on the scores. With respect to the low scores on the MMSE and MoCA in 2021, Dr PT spoke of how patients suffering from dementia may not cooperate and malinger, especially in the context of depression.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Professor K also stated that he recognised that decisions are time and issue specific and that clinical assessments are important, not simply mental state scores. The only one who met with P for purposes of assessment was Dr PT. In hearing him, he appeared to be confident of his interactions with his patient and his assessment of capacity arising from that interaction. While I agree with Professor K that the act of indicating whether one wants to renounce one’s rights to administer an estate is not a “yes” or “no” answer, I do not believe that P was being pressed to give such an answer without understanding, retaining, weighing and communicating her decision to renounce. In fact, her high MoCA scores in 2019 of 27/30 came after the brain scans which show severe loss of volume in the hippocampus and which the applicant argues would prevent cognitive ability. If one were to accept the applicant’s position on brain atrophy, the MoCA readings would have produced a much lower number even in 2019. It did not, lending to the argument that the interaction between physician and patient in this case would be key.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Would Dr PT have benefitted from knowing of previous MoCA scores and medical reports? The answer must certainly be in the affirmative. It may have driven him to do further investigations. To suggest however that the diagnosis that was made was wrong would not, without more, be a fair conclusion. The applicant insisted that Dr PT’s lack of knowledge of previous medical reports and tests should bring into question the assessment that he made. Again, I do not believe this in and of itself disqualifies reliance. It can certainly be equally argued that if a doctor is informed of previous reports, he may take the convenient route of quickly aligning with those views. Clearly it would be dangerous to take either position. I had no reason to doubt the evidence of Dr PT who assessed P. Some key aspects of communication need to be noted. She was asked to write a sentence with a noun and a verb and she wrote very clearly that she wanted to divide her property into 3 equal parts for her children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Dr PT gave in evidence that P wrote the sentence without any cue<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> dismissing the suggestion that P lacked clarity in expressing her position. Further, the assessment of Dr PT was aligned with the views of the LR who interviewed P in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The MoCA and MMSE are simplistic tools and the scores meant to direct further investigations. Even if the test scores produced by Dr PT were discounted, I would have to accept that the earlier lower scores were accurate. This would be difficult to do in light of the fact as mentioned above, 2019 MoCA scores were high even though brain scans conducted prior to the MoCA being administered would suggest that the high 2019 score was implausible. Yet, it exists. Professor K’s position that the scans and medical reports show that P was suffering from moderate to severe dementia which would prevent a decision to be made on renunciation is difficult to accept. It is not clear exactly where P’s dementia was on the spectrum and the impact of any decision on renunciation. It bears repeating that Professor K did not have the benefit of assessing P. The interaction between Dr PT and P, the articulation of the interaction he had with P when he gave his evidence and the LR’s expression of P’s position in relation to estate matters of her late husband shows cogency sufficient to keep the renunciation in place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Professor K confirmed that he would not be able to conclude on P’s capacity as at 5 or 6 September 2022. In fact, he was not aware that when the MoCA test were conducted prior to P’s first appointment with Dr PT in 2022, she was suffering from depression which he acknowledged may have had an impact on the 2021 scores. When P saw the doctors in Penang on 2019 and in 2021, she scored 8/15 and 7/15 on the Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS), respectively. The applicant minimised the potential effect of depression by submitting that it could not have played a very significant role given that the 2019 MoCA score of 27/30 was better with a higher depression score than the 2021 MoCA of 17/30 when she was less depressed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It bears repeating that this is the same concern with respect to the incongruence between the brain scans in 2019 and the high MoCA score in 2019. It would need some conjecture to rationalise these various pieces of evidence. What is clear from Professor K’s own evidence however is that how cooperative a patient is and his or her state of physical and mental health are factors to consider when rationalising the scores. While Professor K’s explanations were clear and his views rooted in vast knowledge and experience, he did not have the benefit of assessment, and he did not have the benefit of interaction with P on 6 September 2022. It would be unsafe from a legal standpoint to allow for theoretical assessments in an area which calls for personal and practical ones.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Is there a need for further medical assessment?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The prayer of the applicant for a medical assessment to be conducted by a geriatric neurologist to ascertain the capacity of P insofar as it sheds light on her capacity in September 2022 is an exercise in futility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In proceedings of this nature, there are often requests for repeated assessments to be conducted until the answer that a party seeks is obtained. While clearly there is a need to test the methods and conclusions obtained or presented by medical practitioners, there are also some limits that need to be observed. One is when there is absolutely no value is proceeding with further assessments which put individuals with neurocognitive diseases through further discomfort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The regime in this area is to protect those who have lost autonomy, and not to subject them to further tests for purposes of litigation which brings no value to him. It is also important to ensure that in seeking the truth, that medical professionals are not unfairly subjected to criticism as was seen in the applicant’s unnecessary reference to Dr PT as a “dangerous man”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Even if a medical assessment today is conducted today and it reveals that P does not have mental capacity, it will not assist this court on whether she had capacity in September 2022 to renounce her right to administer her late husband’s estate. Professor K acknowledges this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The applicant sought to reopen similar issues that were before the High Court in OA 637. While the applicant certainly has a right to be fully heard if indeed there was evidence obtained to cast fair doubt with regards the work of Dr PT in relation to his September 2022 assessment, I was of the view that what was presented failed to show a lack of professionalism and competency on the part of Dr PT in coming to the conclusion that P had mental capacity as at 16 December 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While I had no doubt that Professor K was assisting the court and that his views and opinions are valid theoretically, the nature of the MoCA and MMSE as simple screening tools, the incongruity of the brain scan results and the results of the 2019 MoCA, the lack of knowledge of the circumstances that P faced during each of these tests (including the fact that she presented with depression in 2021) and the fact that Professor K did not assess P, collectively lend towards the point the AD had made in the appeal against the decision in OA 637 - that is, there is little relevance in having doctors comment on the work of other doctors without the opportunity of meeting, understanding and assessing the patient – the very cornerstone of medical practice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The LR’s evidence that P was able to make a decision as it related to renunciation, is material. In OA 637, P was not a party to proceedings. For the matter before me, she was a participant and had the opportunity to inform the LR in clear terms, her lack of desire to administer the estate of her late husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The need for further medical assessment is clearly an unproductive exercise. To declare that P lacked capacity in renouncing her right to be an executrix and trustee is to ignore the net effect of such a position. It would be to leave the estate matters in the hands of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, the very position which came about as a result of the renunciation. More importantly, it will not assist in any understanding of her mental state on 6 September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The applicant appears to have concerns about moving out of the property he resides in and with the role of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent as executor and trustee. Any legitimate concern can be addressed through a proper application in a probate court. The application in this court is misplaced.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Originating Summons (Amendment No.3).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30861-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 1</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>AD/CA 119/2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>At paragraph 37 of the Judgment.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><b><em>Wong Meng Cheong &amp;

(“<b>Complaint</b>”) In the Complaint, the Wife alleged that the Husband had committed family violence on various occasions for the past four years, with the most recent incident being on 7 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s objection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Before proceeding further, I wish to deal with a preliminary issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“<b>AEIC</b>”) and testimony, the Wife alleged that after she had filed her PPO application on 10 July 2024, the Husband committed further family violence on 11 July and 5 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband objected to evidence of the 11 July and 5 August incidents being considered at the trial. He gave three reasons for taking this position. <em>First</em>, he submitted that “the Wife is bound by the four corners of her Complaint” and that she should not refer to matters not raised in the Complaint. To support his submission, the Husband referred to my observation in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> (“<b><em>XEP</em></b>”). In that case, I had held that “the evidence in a PPO trial should be confined to those that support or rebut the allegations of family violence contained <em>in an applicant’s Complaint</em>” [emphasis added].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span><em>Second</em>, the Husband submitted that before receiving the Wife’s AEIC, he did not know that she would be raising the 11 July and 5 August incidents. As such, he did not have the opportunity to address them in his AEIC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span><em>Finally</em>, the Husband was merely brought through the Wife’s allegations regarding the two incidents during his cross-examination – he was not invited to give his account of what had happened for these incidents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XEP is distinguishable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In my view, the Husband’s reliance on <em>XEP</em> to exclude evidence of the 11 July and 5 August incidents at the trial is misplaced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is useful to set out (in full) my observations in <em>XEP</em> at [15(a)]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>As a starting point</em>, the evidence in a PPO trial should be confined to those that support or rebut the allegations of family violence in the applicant’s complaint. <em>If there are good reasons to depart from this starting position, then notice of the further evidence must be given as soon as possible.</em> This is because <em>it is important that the other party (i) is not taken by surprise and (ii) has sufficient opportunity to respond to the further evidence at the trial</em> ....</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>From the above, I clearly did not rule out the possibility of admitting evidence of incidents of family violence allegedly committed after a complaint is filed (“<b>Other Incidents</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is also important to highlight the context in which the observations in [5(a)] above had been made. In <em>XEP</em>, the applicant had requested to admit evidence of Other Incidents <em>while cross-examining the respondent</em>. No advance notice was given of this. I disallowed the applicant’s request as it was highly prejudicial to the respondent: <em>XEP</em> at [15(b)] and [15(c)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Key considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In my view, the following considerations are relevant in deciding whether to allow evidence of Other Incidents to be admitted in a trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A court should not put on blinkers, inflexibly shut out evidence of family violence, and require a victim of such violence to go through the trouble of filing a further PPO application – just because the violence allegedly occurs after the initial PPO application is filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     At the same time, the respondent’s right of having due notice of the allegation made against him/her and to prepare his/her response should also be preserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As I have made clear in <em>XEP</em>, to strike a balance between the two considerations above, the admission of evidence of the Other Incidents is permissible only if “the other party (i) is not taken by surprise and (ii) has sufficient opportunity to respond to the further evidence at the trial”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Ruling on preliminary issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Returning to the present case, I am of the view that it is appropriate to admit evidence of the 11 July and 5 August incidents at the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband had ample notice that the Wife was going to refer to these incidents at the trial. This is because about <em>two months before</em> the trial began, the Wife had already set out in detail her allegations regarding the 11 July and 5 August incidents in her AEIC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Unlike the respondent in <em>XEP</em>, the Husband was not taken by surprise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband did not raise any objection to the Wife referring to the two incidents during the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband had sufficient opportunity to respond to the Wife’s allegations regarding two incidents – either by adducing rebuttal evidence during his examination-in-chief or by cross-examining her about them. He did not do either.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Having addressed the preliminary issue, I will now touch on the Wife’s burden of proof at the trial. To succeed in her PPO application, she must prove two things on a balance of probabilities. <em>First</em>, she must prove that the Husband had committed or is likely to commit family violence against the 1<sup>st</sup> Son and herself. <em>Second</em>, she must also prove that a PPO “is necessary” for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Did the Husband commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I will now assess whether the Wife has discharged her burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Random acts of physical violence </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is the Wife’s case that for more than a year, the Husband had hit the 1<sup>st</sup> Son for no good reason. He would do so by using, e.g., an exercise stick, a cane, a belt, a hanger, and heavy books. He would also hit the child for being fidgety while doing his work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife did not give any other details, such as the dates, regarding these instances of violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I find that the Wife has “not proved” her allegations in [10] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the allegations of family violence are too generic and bare. It is not clear in what context the Husband had allegedly committed the violence. Such context is necessary, for instance, (i) to enable the Husband to properly respond to these allegations, (ii) to determine whether the correction exception is applicable, and (iii) to assess whether the Wife’s allegations are credible and reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, it appears that the Wife did not personally witness many of the alleged incidents of violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To be clear, the finding in [12] above does not mean that (a) the Wife’s allegations have been “proved” to be false or (b) the Husband has “disproved” them. For a discussion on the concepts of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved”, see s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893; <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0286.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 286</a> at [18] to [21]; <em>R Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0063.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 63</a> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">March 2024 – Tutoring incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I now turn to an alleged incident of family violence where the Wife has provided more background details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     According to the Wife, sometime in March 2024, while attending to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son in the children’s bedroom, she heard the Husband speaking loudly. He had apparently lost his temper while tutoring the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. On leaving the bedroom to investigate, the Wife saw the Husband (a) berating the child, (b) punching and kicking him all over his body (including his face, abdomen, legs and back), and (c) striking the child’s head with hardcover books and rulers. The Husband stopped the violence when the Wife intervened. However, when she returned to the children’s bedroom, he continued to berate and hit the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. The Husband stopped when the Wife intervened again – but would resume the violence after she had left. There were more than 20 times of such interventions, and the entire incident lasted for about 15 minutes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations. He submitted that her allegations should be disbelieved because there were several material discrepancies and gaps in her evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> These related to the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>When did the incident allegedly occurred</u>? The Wife had given conflicting accounts of when the incident had occurred: December 2023 (according to the Complaint) and March 2024 (according to the Wife’s AEIC).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>How was the family violence allegedly committed?</u> In her AEIC, the Wife initially stated that the Husband had “punched and kicked” the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. In a later part of her AEIC, she stated that he had used hardcover books and rulers to hit the child’s head.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <u>Who had entered/left the room</u>. The Wife had given two conflicting accounts as to the identity of the person who had entered and left the room. In her AEIC, she claimed that she was the one. In cross-examination however, she testified that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <u>Was the Wife hit?</u> During cross-examination, the Wife testified that the Husband had hit her during the incident. There is no such allegation in the Complaint or her AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <u>The Wife’s alleged reaction to the violence.</u> According to the Husband, it is incredible that for more than 20 occasions of assault on the 1<sup>st</sup> Son, the Wife “did nothing practical to stop” the Husband “other than to chide [him]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, the Wife has “not proved” her allegations in [15].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her AEIC, the Wife stated that she had left the children’s bedroom for about 20 occasions to intervene in the Husband’s repeated abuse of the 1<sup>st</sup> Son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This is a key feature of her allegation regarding how the alleged abuse had occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     However, during cross-examination, the Wife changed her evidence. She testified that it was the 1<sup>st</sup> Son – not her – who had gone “in and out of the room 20 times”. She maintained the same position during re-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In my view, the discrepancy in the Wife’s evidence is material. Arising from the discrepancy, it is unclear to me what had really occurred at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">23 March 2024 – Tooth extraction incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I turn to the Wife’s next allegation of family violence. This incident took place in the night of 23 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     According to the Wife, the Husband lost his temper when she questioned his decision to send the 1<sup>st</sup> Son for tooth extraction. Specifically, he (a) raised his fist at her, (b) shouted that the date for the extraction could not be changed, (c) told her to follow his rules as she was staying in his house, and (d) threw a laundry basket (filled with laundry) at her. The basket hit the Wife’s stomach and thigh area. She fled into her bedroom and locked the door for safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations in [19] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He submitted that these allegations should be disbelieved.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Wife was not fearful of the Husband</u> <em>.</em> According to the Husband, the following events had occurred <em>before</em> the alleged violence: (i) Prior to 11.41 pm, he had discussed with the Wife about the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s teeth issue; (ii) At 11.41 pm, the Wife texted him, “<em>you never send yet</em>”; and (iii) At 11.42 pm, he sent her an image of the X-ray of the child’s teeth. According to the Husband, the fact that the Wife had asked him for the X-ray showed that she was not fearful of him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Failure to seek help</u>. The Husband highlighted the Wife’s evidence that after being hit by the laundry basket, she felt that “[her] life was in danger”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> According to the Husband, it was incredible that despite being fearful of her life, the Wife did not (i) call for the Police or ambulance or (ii) go for a medical check-up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I fail to see why the mere fact that the Wife had sent the message at 11.41 pm to him proves that she was not fearful of him <em>at a later point in time</em> when he threw the laundry basket at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the mere fact that the Wife did not seek Police help or medical attention at the material time does not undermine her evidence of what the Husband had done. It is well established that victims of violence do not always behave in a set or rational manner. It is unreasonable to dissect the Wife’s reaction on the night of 23 March 2024 and pass judgement on what she should or should not have done based on hindsight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, and in any event, I find the Wife’s act of fleeing to her bedroom and locking the door after the Husband had thrown the laundry basket at her to be a reasonable response to his violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In my view, the Wife is probably telling the truth regarding her evidence in [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is the Husband’s case that he was “upset” with the Wife at the material time. This is because she had chosen to raise the tooth extraction issue at close to midnight and thus disrupted his sleep.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is highly unlikely that the Wife had fabricated her evidence for the purpose of building a case to support a PPO application. The incident had occurred some <em>four months before</em> she filed the application. All these show that the Wife did not intend to make an issue out of the incident at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If the Wife had wanted to frame the Husband, she could easily have made a simpler allegation against him, e.g., that he had slapped her. She did not. Instead, she alleged that he had thrown a laundry basket at her. In my view, the unusual way in which the family violence was committed lends credibility to her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7 July 2024 – Triggering incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Next, I come to the incident that triggered the Wife’s PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On 7 July 2024, the Wife was attending to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son in the children’s bedroom. At one point, she began noticing that the 1<sup>st</sup> Son was extremely fidgety and was walking between the living room and his bedroom many times for more than one hour. Suddenly, she heard the Husband shouting angrily and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son crying in the living room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     On leaving the bedroom to investigate, the Wife saw the Husband forcefully slapping the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s head near to the ear.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> She told him to stop. After he agreed,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> she returned to the children’s bedroom to tend to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Later, the Wife heard the Husband scolding the 1<sup>st</sup> Son again. She messaged him at 10.26 pm and threatened to call the Police if he hit the child’s head again. The Wife then heard a loud bang that sounded like the Husband smashing the table. Moments later, he was at the children’s bedroom. The Husband angrily banged the door, aggressively waved his fist at her, and shouted, <em>“Go ahead and call the police if you can!</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife told the Husband that his actions had gone beyond disciplining the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. On noticing that she was making a <em>video recording</em> on her phone, the Husband knocked the phone out of her hand and punched her chest twice. The Wife called the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Husband admitted that he had scolded the 1<sup>st</sup> Son but denied the rest of the Wife’s allegations. His account of the incident is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     At the material time, the Husband had reminded the 1<sup>st</sup> Son to prepare for school the following day and had reprimanded him for making negative remarks and showing poor attitude. The child then showed his displeasure, used disrespectful remarks against the Husband, and cried to get the Wife’s attention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When the Wife arrived, she sided with the 1<sup>st</sup> Son instead of correcting him. She also sent the Husband messages threatening to call the Police. He told her not to interfere if she was not going to help to correct the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s attitude towards him. The Wife turned nasty, pointed her phone at him, and eventually called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the Police arrived, the Husband said that he did not want the Wife in the Flat and asked for her house keys and the children’s passports. The Wife surrendered these items and left thereafter with the 1<sup>st</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     According to the Husband, the Wife’s evidence should be disbelieved for the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Her evidence that she had merely cautioned him against further hurting the 1<sup>st</sup> Son and then returned to soothe the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to sleep is incredible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife deleted the messages that she had sent to him that night. In these messages, she had threatened to call the Police if he continued to hit the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. Her explanation for deleting these messages – because she was afraid that he might become angry on seeing them – is inconsistent with the fact that she was brave enough to take a video recording of him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife had deleted the messages “to destroy evidence which may be detrimental to her false allegation of violence against the Husband”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The 1<sup>st</sup> Son was not found to have suffered any bleeding on his body when examined by a medical officer at the Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Wife did not go for medical check-up to show that she had suffered injuries to her chest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Whether the Husband had committed family violence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Regarding the submission in [29(a)] above, the Wife explained that she had returned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son only after the Husband had agreed not to use further violence on the 1<sup>st</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for the submission in [29(b)] above, I do not see anything incongruous between (i) the Wife’s reason for deleting the messages and (ii) her <em>subsequent</em> act of taking a video of the incident. It bears highlighting that she began to record the video <em>only after an escalation</em> in the incident: see [26] and [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I find the submission in [29(c)] above to be disingenuous. If there is anything in the deleted messages that discredits the Wife’s case, then I would have expected the Husband – being the recipient of these messages – to have testified about their contents. He did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     As for the submission in [29(d)], the mere fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> Son did not suffer from any visible bleeding is neither here nor there. After all, it is the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had hit the child’s head.

It is also not disputed that the parties had a disagreement when the Wife intervened to stop him from punishing the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s account regarding the events that night is detailed, textured, and clear.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the other hand, the Husband’s account is highly unsatisfactory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He testified that the Wife had assaulted him during the incident. He did not mention this in his AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Further, the Husband gave incoherent and inconsistent responses during cross-examination when questioned about the details of his case. He struggled to describe in his own words what the Wife had done that night.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Events after the video recording started</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>(d)     From her video recording,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> the Wife can be heard accusing the Husband three times of having hit the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s head and warning him that the child could “die” from such an assault. The Husband did not deny these repeated accusations. Instead, he said that he knew what he was doing. When asked why he had hit the child’s head, the Husband responded that he was teaching him about “respect”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband can be heard in the video recording speaking in an aggressive manner. On the other hand, the Wife’s tone was measured but firm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Towards the end of the video recording, the Husband could be seen angrily reaching out towards the Wife, saying “You stop it huh”, and swiping the handphone away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_g\"></a>(g)     It is not disputed that the Wife had called the Police that night. There is no reason for her to do so if the Husband had merely <em>scolded</em> the 1<sup>st</sup> Son for being disrespectful. In my view, it is more probable that the Wife had called the Police because he had assaulted the child and her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Whether the correction exception is applicable</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Having found that family violence was committed on the 1<sup>st</sup> Son, the next question is whether the Husband’s actions come within the correction exception.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> At this juncture, it is useful to set out the scope of this exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>The exception</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Section 64 of the Charter provides that family violence “does not include any <em>force lawfully used</em> … <em>by way of correction</em> towards a child below 21 years of age”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On a plain reading –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The correction principle applies only when the family violence involves a use of force. The exception does <em>not</em> apply where the family violence involves (1) placing a child in fear of hurt, (2) confining or restraining the child against his/her will, or (3) continual harassment of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       A respondent to a PPO application must satisfy two requirements before the correction exception is applicable. <em>First</em>, he/she must show that the force was used as a means of correcting a child below 21 years of age. <em>Second</em>, the respondent must also show that the force had been “lawfully used”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Reason for the use of force</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The first requirement focusses on the <em>purpose/reason</em> for the use of force – it must be to correct a child’s behaviour and attitude. In my view, a use of force for corrective purpose will be “lawful” (second requirement) <em>if it is intended to benefit the child –</em> i.e., to inculcate in the child the appropriate way to conduct himself/herself (i) as a person and (ii) in his/her relationship with others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Accordingly, if the use of force is <em>not</em> for the child’s benefit, it will fall outside of the correction exception and thus constitute family violence. Some examples of this are where force is used primarily because –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The parent is angry with the child or his/her behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The parent wants to vent his/her frustration on matters unrelated to the child. See e.g., <em>TCV v TCU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16808-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 3</a> (“<b><em>TCV</em></b>”) at [49], [51] and [57] (Where the parent slapped and caned the child because she blamed the child for being the cause of her unhappiness with her (the parent’s) father); <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> (“<b><em>VYB</em></b>”) at [38] (Where the mother hit the child because she was angry that the child’s father had thrown away the cane).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The parent is under financial, work or other forms of stress. In the context of offences against young victims, it has been held that “the frustrations faced by a parent or a caregiver due to his or her difficult personal circumstances can <em>never</em> justify or excuse the abuse of such victims”: <em>Public Prosecutor v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> at [75]. In my view, this observation is equally relevant in the application of the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The parent wants to assert power or control over the child: see e.g., <em>TCV</em> at [13] and [70].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_e\"></a>(e)     How does one determine whether a parent’s use force is for the child’s benefit? To answer this question, one can consider the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       What has the child done that warrants corrective action?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       What has the parent said before, during and after force is used on the child? For instance, has the parent provided a reasonable explanation for the punishment: see e.g., <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [46]? Is the use of force accompanied by derogatory remarks: see <em>VYB</em> at [37] (Where the court found that the mother’s utterances at her child who had soiled his clothes – that he was a “stupid idiot” and an “animal”, and threats to “kick [him] outside”, to hit him until “black eye” and “leg pains got blood”, to cut off his penis, and to hit him 100 times if he continued to protest – revealed that her use of force was primarily out of anger and was not for correction).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Manner the force is used</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_f\"></a>(f)     To come within the correction exception, the Charter requires the force to have been “lawfully used”. In the context of s 64, the word “lawfully” can be understood as using force “<em>in a way</em> that is allowed or recognised by law” (emphasis added).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The word – which is an adverb and is synonymous with “properly” and “reasonably”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> – thus describes the <em>manner</em> the force is used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Clearly, the <em>excessiv</em>e use of force is “improper” and “unreasonable” – and thus “unlawful”. This is in line with local jurisprudence on the correction exception as well as the following observations in <em>R v Hopeley</em> [1860] EW Misc J73 (“<b><em>Hopeley</em></b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">By the law of England, a parent … may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child inflict <em>moderate and reasonable</em> corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable. If it be administered for the gratification of passion or of rage, or if it be <em>immoderate and excessive in its nature or degree</em>, or if it be protracted beyond the child's powers of endurance, or with an instrument unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce danger to life or limb; in all such cases the punishment is <em>excessive, the violence is unlawful</em> ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Various considerations can assist in determining whether the use of force is excessive or reasonable. They include the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Is the use of force <em>measured</em> – or is it random, unrestrained, and/or gratuitous? Is force used for a prolonged period? See e.g., <em>VYB</em> at [14(b)] (Held: Punching is unacceptable <em>per se</em>); <em>BJJ v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18371-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 3</a> at [39] (Held: Acts of kicking a child’s head and body, hitting the head with a bunch of keys, and hitting the face and causing a nose bleed automatically went beyond reasonable disciplining); <em>Lau Siao Hwee Rosana v Wong Chew Kong</em>, SS 18/1998, cited in Practitioner’s Library: Family and Juvenile Court Practice (LexisNexis, 2008) at pp 78-79 (Held: Family violence established as the parent had hit the child with a toy violin until it broke); <em>CSW v CSX</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 204 (“<b><em>CSW</em></b>”) at [70] (Held: Light tap on a child’s head to correct his/her rude and inattentive behaviour came within the correction exception).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Has the parent used an <em>instrument</em> to inflict the force? If so, is the instrument unfitted for the purpose of discipline? See e.g., <em>Hopeley</em> (discussed at [32(g)]); <em>CSW</em> (discussed at [32(h)(i)] above); <em>TLZ v TLY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18672-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 37</a> (“<b><em>TLZ</em></b>”) at [53] (Held: Using a belt to hit a four-year-old child on the leg is not an acceptable form of correction). Is the instrument likely to endanger the child’s safety and health? Where a cane is used, it has been held that whether the correction exception is applicable depends on the number and extent of bruises caused: <em>BHR v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18370-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 2</a> at [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Is the amount of force used <em>proportionate to the child’s misbehaviour</em>? See <em>AVF v AVH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0363.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 363</a> at [30]; <em>TLZ</em> at [53] (Held: Using a belt to hit a child for a relatively minor misbehaviour (not greeting the parent) is not an acceptable form of correction).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The <em>child’s age and personal characteristics</em> are also relevant considerations in assessing whether the use of force is excessive. The type and manner of sanction on the child must be age appropriate. For instance, the use of force that is beyond the child’s power of endurance is unreasonable: <em>Hopeley</em> (discussed at [32(g)]). Punishment is also likely to be found to be unreasonable if (1) it is beyond the child’s level of comprehension or (2) the child is unable to change the behaviour which the parent seeks to correct. See e.g., <em>VYB</em> at [45] (Held: The mother’s punishments and threats did not commensurate with the six-year-old child’s maturity as he was left confused, and he lacked the faculties to modify his behaviour of soiling his clothes).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_h-p3_v\"></a>(v)       Finally, the <em>effect</em> of the force on the child is also a relevant consideration. It is difficult to see how the use of force can be in a child’s interest if its detriment outweighs its benefit. This is especially so where the force causes the child unnecessary pain, suffering, or trauma: <em>TCV</em> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Applying the above principles to the present case, I find that the Husband has failed to prove that his act of forcefully hitting the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s head near to the ear comes within the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Reason for the use of force</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is the Husband’s evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Son had made negative and disrespectful remarks against him and had shown “poor attitude”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> From the video recording, the Husband can be heard saying repeatedly that he was “teaching” the child how to “respect” his parents. <em>It is not clear what exactly the child had done that is “disrespectful”</em>. If the Husband had hit the child’s head simply to assert his power and control over the child, then this is not for the child’s benefit: see [32(d)(iv)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Manner the force is used</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the video recording, the Wife had repeatedly warned the Husband that by hitting the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s head, he could cause the child (then about 10 years old) “a lot of problems” – including “killing him”. She had also highlighted that the Husband was of a much bigger built than the child and that his hitting carried a lot of “power”. The Husband did not pay heed. Instead, he responded angrily that he “will teach [the child] the way it is” and that he knew what he was doing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, given that the Husband had failed to show on what exactly the 1<sup>st</sup> Son had done that is “disrespectful”, there is no evidence to show that his act of hitting the child’s head forcefully is a measured and proportionate response to the child’s (mis)behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11 July 2024 – Metal gate incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Undisputed facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I now come to the next incident of alleged family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     This incident occurred after the Husband had evicted the Wife and 1<sup>st</sup> Son had been evicted from the Flat. On 11 July 2024, the Wife had returned to the Flat unannounced to retrieve her personal belongings and those of the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. On arriving at the Flat, the Husband opened the door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, the Husband attempted to forcibly push her out on seeing her. She became stuck between the door and the doorframe of the metal gate. He then deliberately pushed the door even harder, causing it to press against her left thigh and chest (sternum) area. The Wife eventually managed to extricate herself from between the door and the doorframe.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> As a result of the incident, the Wife suffered visible injuries to her left palm and left thigh.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Husband, the Wife had attempted to force her way into the Flat when he opened the door. He held the main door firm and told her that she ought to have given advance notice before coming to the Flat. The Wife proceeded to stick one of her legs through the door and shouted, “Domestic violence”. The Husband eventually succeeded in closing the door after a struggle for 10-15 minutes. According to the Husband, any hurt caused to the Wife was self-inflicted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband had used force</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Based on the above facts, the Husband had clearly used force on the Wife at the material time – by forcefully closing the door on her while she was attempting to enter the Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband justified his actions by claiming that he was acting in “self-defence” when the Wife attempted to force her way into the Flat – as she “must have been fully aware that she has no entitlement to enter the [Flat] without [his] prior consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Applicable principles</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Given the Husband’s case, it is necessary for me to consider whether the self-defence exception applies to him. According to s 64 of the Charter, a use of force does not amount to family violence if it is “<em>lawfully</em> used in self-defence”. In other words, the Husband must prove that the circumstances and the way he had used force against the Wife is <em>permitted by law</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Interestingly, the Penal Code 1871 (“<b>Penal Code</b>”) contains provisions regulating when the use of force for the purpose of private defence is legally permissible. These provisions – to the extent that they are relevant in the context of family violence – stipulate the following conditions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A person has the right of private defence in <em>only two situations</em>, namely –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       To defend his <em>own body</em> and the <em>body of any other person against any offence</em> affecting the human body: s 97(a) of the Penal Code; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       To defend any <em>property</em> against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit such offences: s 97(b) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The <em>exercise</em> of the right of private defence, where it arises, is subject to certain limits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>One</em>, it does not extend to the inflicting of more harm than it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances: s 98(1) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Two</em>, there is no right of private defence where there is reasonable opportunity to have recourse to the protection of a public authority in the circumstances: s 98(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Three</em>, in the case of the right of private defence of the <em>body</em>, this right –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Starts as soon as the defender reasonably believes that there is danger to the body arising from any act which is an offence against the human body or an attempt or a threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed: s 101(1) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       Continues as long as the defender believes that the above danger persists: s 101(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Four</em>, in the case of the right of private defence of property against <em>theft</em>, this right –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Starts when the defender reasonably believes that there was a danger to property arising from any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit such an offence: s 104(1) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_2\"></a>(2)       Ends in three situations. First, when the offender has retreated with the property. Second, when the assistance of a public authority is obtained. Finally, when the property has been recovered: s 104(2) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)        <em>Lastly</em>, the right of private defence of property against <em>criminal trespass</em> or <em>mischief</em> continues as long as the offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief: s 104(4) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In my view, the above conditions placed by the Penal Code on the exercise of the right of private defence should equally apply when one considers whether force has been “lawfully used in self-defence” in the context of family violence cases. A contrary view will mean that a person may be absolved of having committed family violence pursuant to the self-defence exception under the Charter – but can still be held criminally liable under the Penal Code because he falls outside of the private defence exception. Such an anomalous and absurd result cannot be right. Parliament is presumed to act consistently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Self-defence exception is not applicable</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Applying the considerations in [39] above, I find that the Husband’s act of forcefully closing the door on the Wife while she was attempting to enter the Flat falls outside of the self-defence exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, his use of force does not come within either of the two situations stated in [39(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and for completeness, I find that the Wife’s attempt to enter the Flat does not constitute “criminal trespass” as defined in s 441 of the Penal Code. This is because she clearly did not have the “intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy” the Husband at the material time. I say this because the Wife had pressed the doorbell for him to open the door.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> She would not have announced her arrival in such a manner if she had a sinister intent at the material time. Furthermore, the Wife’s intention of entering the Flat was for the innocent purpose of retrieving her personal belongings. The Husband did not dispute this evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband’s position that the Wife had “no entitlement to enter the [Flat] without [his] prior consent” is clearly misconceived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Charter clearly stipulates that any asset acquired during marriage by one party to the marriage is “matrimonial asset” to which the other party can have a share: s 112(1) and (10). In the present case, the Husband had acquired the Flat <em>during</em> the parties’ marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, he had also intended the Flat to be matrimonial asset.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> This means that the Wife has the right to enter the Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Apart from family law, the Wife clearly also has a right to retrieve her belongings from the Flat. If the Husband unlawfully interferes with such a right, he can be liable for the tort of conversion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">5 August 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Finally, I come to the incident of 5 August 2024. On that day, the Wife had returned to the Flat (again) to retrieve her personal belongings and those of the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. This time, she was accompanied by a Sunday church schoolteacher (“<b>teacher</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, the Husband (i) had rushed her to pack her items, (ii) had placed her in fear by locking the Flat’s door, and (iii) had forced her to sign a letter which was not in her native language. While the teacher was translating the letter’s contents to her, the Husband took the opportunity to go through her items. Later, when the Wife had time to check her bag, she realised that some items were missing. They included jewellery, cash, commemorative notes and her children’s piggybanks amounting to $15,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband did not give any evidence regarding the 5 August incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my view, the Wife had failed to prove that the Husband had committed “family violence” – as the term is defined in s 64 of the Charter – on 5 August 2024.

I have come to this finding for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Violence committed recently</u> <em>.</em> The last incident of family violence against the Wife was committed just a few months prior to my verdict in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Violence not isolated incident</u>. Altogether, the Husband had committed family violence against the Wife on three occasions: see [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <u>Unresolved issues</u>. There is no evidence that the underlying cause for the family violence – i.e., how to manage and discipline the 1<sup>st</sup> Son – has been unresolved between the parties. According to the Wife, Husband is ill-equipped and/or does not have the temperament to handle the child who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <u>Future interactions</u> <em>.</em> I am mindful that the parties are no longer living together. In my view, this does not render a PPO unnecessary. Two points bear highlighting. <em>One</em>, the family violence had arisen because of the Husband’s unhappiness with the Wife for interfering in his actions relating to the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. Assuming that the parties have joint custody of the child, the potential for conflicts over parenting styles will remain. <em>Two</em>, given that the parties are living apart, they will need to interact regularly regarding the Husband’s access to the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. There is evidence that the child is reluctant to see the Husband: see [50(b)] below. In the circumstances, the issue of child access is likely to be a source of conflict between the parties in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <u>Acrimonious relationship</u> <em>.</em> During the trial, it is clear to me that the parties’ relationship is very strained. The Husband blames the Wife for denying him access to the 1<sup>st</sup> Son and has taken up an application for interim child access. This application is pending as at the time of verdict. During oral submissions, I was also informed that the Husband finds it upsetting that despite being the father, he can only see the child in the presence of a social worker.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <u>Lack of remorse</u>. The Husband is not apologetic for the violence that he had committed against the Wife. Further, he feels entitled to assert his “rights” against her – including to prevent her from returning to the matrimonial home (for her to collect her belongings) and to evict her from it. It bears highlighting that the Wife is a foreigner with apparently no relatives in Singapore. Because of his decision to evict the Wife, she had to stay at various places, including a shelter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <u>Further violence</u>. Finally, even after the Wife had filed a PPO application on 10 July 2024, the Husband was undeterred. He continued to commit family violence on her the very next day, shortly after having received a court summons relating to her application: see [35] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Protection for the 1<sup>st</sup> Son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Similarly, I find that there is a risk of the Husband committing family violence against the 1<sup>st</sup> Son in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Violence committed recently</u> <em>.</em> The family violence was committed recently (7 July 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Violence not isolated</u>. It appears that the family violence on 7 July 2024 is not an isolated incident. There are several contemporaneous text messages from the Wife to her family in Japan alluding to the fact that the Husband had been violent with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In 2021 (when the 1<sup>st</sup> Son was just seven years old), the Wife had texted that the child was “whipped every day”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In May 2023, the Wife had sent another message about the Husband hitting the child “despite him not doing anything but just because he [did not] like the [1<sup>st</sup> Son’s] moves”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       In July 2023, there is further message from the Wife about the Husband’s physical punishment becoming more severe because of the child’s abnormal behaviour. (In September 2022, the child was found to be autistic.) In the same message, she had also texted that the child “feels a lot more mentally stable when his dad is not around”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>I find that the Wife did not send the above messages for the purpose of building a case for a PPO application against the Husband. These are my reasons for coming to such a finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The messages were sent <em>at least one year before</em> the PPO application was filed (in July 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       Furthermore, the <em>tone and context</em> of the messages show that they were desperate cries for help by a mother who felt frustrated and helpless by the family violence committed against her child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       In September 2021, the Wife had texted that she was “worried that [the whipping] might be reported”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Such an expression of concern – about the implications of the Husband’s violence towards the 1<sup>st</sup> Son coming to light – is inconsistent with case building by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Finally, I wish to add that apart from the messages, there is another piece of evidence which suggests that the Husband had hit the child on multiple occasions for some time: see [50(a)] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <u>Lack of remorse</u>. Based on the Wife’s evidence (which I accept), the Husband did not see anything wrong with him forcefully hitting the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’ head – a vulnerable part of the body – during the 7 July incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <u>Unresolved issues</u>. The Husband committed the violence because of his perception that the 1<sup>st</sup> Son had been “disrespectful”. It bears noting that the child has Autism Spectrum Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. According to the Wife, the Husband is in denial over the fact that the child has autism.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> There is evidence to suggest that because of the Husband’s parenting style, the child has developed issues with his father: see [50(b)] below. During the trial, the Husband did not challenge any of this evidence. Neither did he show how – if at all – he has acknowledged or considered the 1<sup>st</sup> Son’s condition in his approach to managing and disciplining the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <u>Future interactions</u> <em>.</em> As a father, the Husband will continue to have the right to have access to the 1<sup>st</sup> Son. A PPO is necessary to remind him the importance of addressing the issues in (d) above when managing the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Child Guidance Clinic report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Before concluding, I wish to state that in deciding whether to impose a PPO, I have considered a medical report dated 11 September 2024 prepared by the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”). According to the report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The child alleged that he had been hit “by his father since 3 years ago over multiple occasions when he was unable to complete his homework, made mistakes at home or did not respond to his father when spoken to”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The child “had verbalised about having suicidal thoughts by jumping off from his father’s apartment if he were made to return to his father”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(Collectively “<b>Observations</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Observations are <em>clearly relevant</em> to the issue of whether a PPO should be granted: see [49(c)] and [49(e)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I am mindful that the Observations are hearsay (in that the 1<sup>st</sup> Son and the maker of the report did not testify at the trial) and are untested by cross-examination. Nonetheless, I see no reason to doubt the accuracy and objectivity of the Observations. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, according to the CGC report, the Observations are derived from interviews with the 1<sup>st</sup> Son <em>alone</em> during his assessment and therapy sessions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> This means that the Wife was not present during the interview sessions to influence what the child told CGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Observations are consistent with several key aspects of the Wife’s contemporaneous messages (see [49(c)] above), AEIC, and testimony – e.g., regarding when the Husband had started becoming violent towards the child as well as the randomness of his violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Observations are reported by CGC, an independent body. It is a department that comes under the Institute of Mental Health, the national agency charged with the supporting persons with mental health issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband did not raise any objection to the admission of the CGC report.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For the above reasons, I imposed a PPO on the Husband. In my view, the PPO is necessary to deter him from committing family violence against the Wife and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Additionally, I ordered the parties to undergo mandatory counselling.

The Wife made the following allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>The force-feeding.</em></b> At the material time, the Daughter was crying in the master-bedroom (occupied by the Husband). On opening the door, the Wife saw the Husband force-feeding the child with a milk bottle to pacify her and to stop her crying. The Daughter choked and the parties took the child to the toilet to clean up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><em>The threat.</em></b> While attending to the child, the Husband repeatedly shouted at the Wife, “Go away, don’t come near me. … <em>If you continue, I won’t let you see her again</em>”. The Wife felt threatened by these words.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b><em>The shove and injury.</em></b> At one point, the Husband placed the Daughter down on the bed. When the Wife tried to console the child, he shoved the Wife aside to remove her from the child. As a result, the Wife lost her balance, tipped over, and hit her right knee against a desk in the bedroom. This caused her to suffer a bruise on the knee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband denied the above allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I find that the Wife had failed to prove her allegations. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>First</em>, the Husband had tendered a video which shows the events in the master-bedroom on 18 February 2024 from 9.05 pm to 9.14 pm. This video <em>materially contradicts</em> the Wife’s allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>The force-feeding.</em></b> The video does not show the Husband force-feeding the Daughter. Instead, it shows him being very gentle with the child, calling her “<em>Sayang</em>” repeatedly, and trying to pacify her for about 10 mins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><em>The threat.</em></b> Additionally, the video does not show the Husband repeatedly telling the Wife that he would not let her see the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Instead, the video shows him simply telling the Wife to go away and to leave the child alone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Admittedly, the Husband had raised his voice towards the Wife. In my view, this does not constitute family violence in the nature of “continual harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It bears highlighting that at the material time, the parties (being concerned parents) must have been distressed by the child’s vomiting and incessant crying. From the video, the Husband appears to be unhappy with the Wife for interfering in his attempts to pacify the Daughter. The Husband’s remarks and tone of voice to the Wife should be seen against this situational backdrop.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The video also shows that despite having been asked to “go away”, the Wife had remained with the child throughout, and the Husband did not remove her from the bedroom. This shows that the Husband’s remarks were uttered in the heat of the moment and that the Wife was not in fear of him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b><em>The shove and injury.</em></b> Finally, the video does not show the Husband shoving the Wife aside to remove her from the child.

The <em>events</em> in the video and the <em>sequence</em> in which they had occurred – e.g., (i) the Daughter crying, (ii) the Wife entering the bedroom, (iii) the parties bringing the child to the toilet to clean up, (iv) the Husband asking the Wife to go away, and (v) the child being placed on the bed to rest – mirror the Wife’s account of what had happened during the incident. For the Wife’s claim to make sense, the <em>same</em> events would need to have occurred <em>twice</em> – i.e., the first time at <em>before</em> 9.05 pm – and then again for the second time <em>after</em> 9.05 pm.

It is not disputed that on the same day that the Wife left the Flat (i.e., 21 April 2024), the Husband and some of his relatives went to the Parents’ Home at about 9.30 pm to look for the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     According to the Wife, the Husband had caused harassment to her during the visit. <em>First</em>, by “shouting very loudly and threateningly demanding to be let inside the home for him to see the child”, and <em>second</em>, when his demands were denied, by lingering with his relatives at a street across the Parents’ Home for about two hours before finally leaving the area.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband denied having committed family violence.

Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This is a case involving the Wife’s bare claims against the Husband’s bare denials. Apart from the parties’ police reports<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> (such reports can be self-serving), there is no other evidence to show whose evidence is more credible and reliable. In the circumstances, I am unable to find that the Wife’s account of the 21 April incident is more probable than the Husband’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, based on the Wife’s account, I find that the Husband’s actions do not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Wife failed to prove that the Husband had committed the relevant acts <em>with intent to cause or knowing</em> that they are likely to cause anguish to her: see limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” under s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, I accept the Husband’s evidence that he had gone to the Parents’ Home simply to see the Daughter – and not for the purpose of harassing the Wife. It is not disputed that the Wife’s decision for the Daughter to stay at the Parents’ Home came as a <em>surprise</em> to the Husband. (This is evident from the exchange of messages between the parties at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, it is also not disputed that the Husband had sought police assistance and filed an online police complaint <em>before</em> arriving at the Parents’ Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Such actions are more consistent with those of a father who had resorted to legal means to see his child than one who was seeking to cause trouble or harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">26 April 2024 – Commotion at the Daughter’s playschool </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to the 26 April incident. It is not disputed that the Husband and his father had gone to the Daughter’s playschool on that day to see the child. It is also not disputed that the Husband was denied entry into the premises because the Wife had informed the school authorities that he was not “authorised” to see the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     According to the Wife, the Husband had created a commotion and shouted at the school authorities after being disallowed to see the Daughter. As a result, the Wife – who was a staff at the playschool – was asked by the school management to resolve the situation. Eventually, a compromise was reached – the Wife allowed the Husband to see the Daughter briefly from outside the school premises through a glass door. Soon thereafter, the Husband and his father left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband denied having created a commotion at the playschool. He highlighted the fact – which is undisputed – that he had waited outside the school premises to catch a glimpse of the Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In this case, the dispute centres on two issues. <em>First</em>, did the Husband create a commotion at the playschool. <em>Second</em>, if he did, then do his actions constitute family violence. On both issues, the Wife has the burden to prove that the answers are in the affirmative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To discharge her burden of proof, the Wife drew my attention to the fact that when asked whether he was aware that there was a school protocol for visitors, the Husband had responded, “<em>I believe I don’t have to follow any protocols because I am the legal parent of [the Daughter]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Wife submitted that the Husband’s response “[indicated] his <em>intention</em> to create a commotion at [her workplace]” at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I disagree. I find the link that the Wife sought to draw – i.e., between the Husband’s response above and his purported intent to harass her – to be tenuous. The evidence does not prove that the Husband had gone to the playschool to harass the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on the Wife’s own evidence, the Husband had allegedly created a commotion at the playschool <em>only after</em> learning that he was not allowed to see the Daughter. This shows that the alleged commotion was more likely to be the Husband’s <em>spontaneous reaction</em> to being denied access to his child than a deliberate act to harass the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such a spontaneous reaction by the Husband is understandable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is not disputed that the Husband had gone to the playschool to see the Daughter. It bears highlighting that at the material time, he did not have physical access to her <em>for about five days</em> already – i.e., since the day that the Wife left the Flat with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       As a father, it is reasonable for the Husband to believe that he had a right to see his Daughter at the playschool. At the material time, there was no court order denying him access to his child. (The Husband’s response in [27] above ought to be understood in this context.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Finally, the Husband came to know that he was not “authorised” to see the Daughter only after he had arrived at the playschool. This revelation must have come as a shock to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After being informed of the conditions for seeing the Daughter, the Husband had dutifully complied with them. He did not enter the school premises. As required by the Wife, he waited outside the school to catch a brief glimpse of his child through the glass door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After seeing the Daughter, the Husband’s objective for the visit had been met – he left the playschool. He did not, for instance, linger at the school to cause trouble for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">26 April 2024 incident – Showing explicit photo to the Wife’s aunt </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is not disputed that after leaving the playschool, the Husband and his father went to the home of the Wife’s aunt. After the visit, the aunt sent WhatsApp messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> to the Wife requesting to speak to her on the phone urgently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife alleged that during the phone call, the aunt told her that the Husband had showed her explicit photos of the Wife. This caused the Wife to feel anxious and humiliated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations. According to him, he had visited the aunt just to let her know that the Wife had denied him physical access to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I find that the Wife had failed to prove her allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s case is based entirely on what the aunt had allegedly told her. The aunt did not testify at the hearing. In the circumstances, the Wife’s case is based on hearsay evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband – who was a party to the meeting with the aunt – had denied showing any explicit photo of the Wife during the meeting. The Wife is unable to rebut this denial given that she did not call the aunt to testify at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife submitted that I should accept her case on the basis that the Husband (i) had failed to call his father (who was also present at the meeting) to testify and (ii) had failed to produce a CCTV recording from the aunt’s premises of the meeting. In my view, the Husband’s failure to adduce such evidence does not in any way assist the Wife to discharge her own burden of proof. Her case is inherently weak as it is based on hearsay evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">24 May 2024 incident – Commotion at the Daughter’s playschool </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I now come to the next incident. On 24 May 2024, the Husband again visited the Daughter’s playschool. It is not disputed that on this occasion, <em>five</em> of his relatives had also gone to the school at about the same time as him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     According to the Wife, from around 2.45 pm to 4.00 pm,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> the Husband and his relatives began arriving at the school separately. They demanded to see the Daughter. Because of the commotion created, members of the school management, including its director (“<b>Director</b>”), had to intervene to manage the situation. Staff had also to be mobilised to prevent the Husband and his relatives from entering the children’s rooms. According to the Wife, she experienced “extreme fear and panic” at the material time. The Husband and his relatives eventually vacated the premises only after the school management threatened to call the police if they insisted on remaining in the premises and behaving aggressively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband denied that his group had created a commotion at the playschool. According to him, he had remained outside the school premises, his sister and aunt were allowed to sit in the reception area, and the Wife was the one who had been shouting (at his sister and aunt) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <b><em>Wife’s account more credible</em></b>. I find the Wife’s account of the 24 May incident to be more credible than the Husband’s. Given the following, the situation at the material time must have been chaotic and the Wife must have felt harassed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is not disputed that a significant number of persons (the Husband and his five relatives) had all wanted to see and speak to Daughter at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is also not disputed that the Husband and his relatives did not give prior notice to the playschool before their arrival. The school (i) would have been surprised by their visit and (ii) would not have had sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it bears highlighting that by 24 May 2024, the Husband had not physically interacted with the Daughter for more than one month. The Husband and his relatives must have felt frustrated with the Wife and the school for continuing to deny them access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the fact that tensions were high during the visit is evident in a conversation between the Husband and the Director on 27 May 2024, i.e., three days after the visit. (A transcript of this conversation was adduced at the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>) For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At two points during the conversation, the Director told the Husband that he could not “<em>have an entire gin gang of people coming here saying ... I want to see this girl</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> He told the Husband that such actions would affect the school’s operations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> It is clear from the Director’s remarks that the visit on 24 May 2024 by the Husband and his relatives had been chaotic and disruptive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband’s frustration with the Director continued to persist – and this is evident from the conversation. When the Director tried to explain to the Husband why the latter could not take unilateral actions, the Husband threatened him, “<em>I feel like you and my wife are having an affair now. So I can also bring that up to court. Do you want me to do that?</em>” In addition to making threats, the Husband had repeatedly accused the Director of being biased in favour of the Wife because she was his employee. This is despite the fact that on several occasions, the Director had repeatedly emphasised that he was not stopping the Husband from visiting the Daughter – but that such visits must be done in accordance with school protocol. Despite this, the Husband refused to accept what the Director had to say. The Husband kept dominating the conversation and interrupting the Director when the latter tried to explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37      <b><em>Husband complicit in the group visit.</em></b> I have no doubt that the Husband was complicit in what had happened on 24 May 2024. It could not have been a sheer coincidence that five different relatives – including his grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister – had all somehow (a) known where the Daughter’s <em>new</em> playschool was (she was enrolled in another playschool until 21 April 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> (b) wanted to see the child on the same day, and (c) descended at the school at about the same time as the Husband. The visit to the playschool by the Husband and his relatives must have been coordinated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38      <b><em>Husband’s motive.</em></b> In my view, the Husband had committed family violence on 24 May 2024. Having failed to see his Daughter on 26 April 2024 at the playschool, I accept the Wife’s evidence that he had intended to intimidate her with the size of his group and to pressure her into surrendering to his demands to see his child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> For more than an hour, the Husband – acting alone and with the complicity of his relatives – had continually harassed the Wife directly and indirectly through the school management. In behaving in a thuggish manner, the Husband must have intended to cause or known that his actions were likely to cause the Wife anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 June 2024 – Circulation of the Wife’s explicit photo </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I now come to the final incident relied by the Wife for her PPO application. Regarding the 17 June incident, the following is not disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     17 June 2024 was Hari Raya Haji. On that day, the Husband’s mother had shared in a group chat an explicit photo of the Wife with another man. The members of the group chat are the Wife’s parents, the Husband and his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The photo was recorded by a CCTV camera installed in the Flat’s master-bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Apart from the Wife, the Husband was the only person who had access to the CCTV recording.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife believed that the Husband (a) had forwarded the photo to his mother and (b) had caused the photo to be circulated on the group chat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband denied having shared the photo to his mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He also denied being involved in the photo’s circulation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I agree with the Wife that the Husband was probably behind the circulation of the photo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there were only two persons who had access to the CCTV recording that contained the photo – the Husband and the Wife. It is inconceivable that the Wife had provided the embarrassing photo of herself to the Husband’s mother. The only other person who could have done so is the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband had reasons to circulate the photo to the Wife and her parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the material time, he was angry with the Wife for having committed adultery, and had no qualms about exposing the adultery to humiliate her. For instance, on 27 May 2024 (i.e., less than a month before the photo was circulated), the Husband had repeatedly offered to show “graphic evidence” to the Director to discredit the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> On 11 June 2024 (i.e., less than a week before the photo was circulated), the Husband’s lawyers had also written to the Wife’s lawyers to threaten to show “<em>the CCTV footage of [her] sordid conduct, as evidence, at the appropriate juncture</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Importantly, at the time of the photo’s circulation, the Husband had not physically interacted with the Daughter for about two months. This is alluded to in the following message which accompanied the circulation of the photo: “... <em>It’s been almost 2 months since we have seen our g</em>...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband did not disapprove his mother’s act of circulating the photo.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my view, the Husband had probably caused his mother to circulate the photo. He had done so to embarrass the Wife and to compel her to grant him physical access to the Daughter. By circulating the photo during the festive occasion of Hari Raya, the intention is clearly to cause maximum distress to the Wife and her parents. Such conduct is malicious and highly reprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence has been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     To sum up, I find that the Husband had committed family violence against the Wife on two occasions – (a) 24 May 2024 and (b) 17 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While a father’s anxiety and desire to see his daughter is understandable, what the Husband had done during these two incidents have crossed the line. These incidents show that he has no qualms in employing reprehensible means – such as mob tactics and circulating explicit photo – to harass and pressure the Wife into giving in to his demand to see his child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I wish to emphasize one thing. <em>Legal rights must be enforced through legal means – not through the commission of family violence</em>. I find it particularly deplorable that the Husband and his relatives had seen it fit to cause a commotion at a playschool – which is supposed to be a safe place for young children. They have done so with blatant disregard for the alarm that their actions might cause to these children. This is simply not acceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">PPO necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, a PPO is necessary to protect the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The two incidents of family violence were triggered by the Wife’s denial of the Husband’s physical access to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties have not been able to resolve the child issues between themselves amicably. This is evident from the fact that there are contested applications between them for custody, care and control, as well as access to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given that the Daughter is still very young (only about three years old), it is likely that the parties will continue to have disagreements over her custody, care, control, and access in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     A PPO will serve to warn the Husband against committing family violence against the Wife to resolve such disagreements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Grounds for application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I will now turn to the Husband’s application.

It is not disputed that on that day, the Wife was recorded on CCTV to have been vaping in the bedroom with the Daughter lying next to her. The child was about 1½ years old at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     According to the Husband, the Wife had shown a “callous disregard” for the Daughter’s well-being by vaping in her presence. The Wife had continued her vaping habit even after leaving the Flat on 21 April 2024. To support this claim, the Husband relied on the undisputed fact that Health Sciences Authority (“<b>HSA</b>”) had found the Wife to be in possession of vaping devices on 18 May 2024 at the Parents’ Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> He is concerned that the Wife will continue to vape in the child’s presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     According to the Wife –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She was not aware that vaping besides the Daughter would be harmful to the child’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any event, she had since stopped the vaping habit and had surrendered all the paraphernalia to HSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband had reported her vaping habit to the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Following the complaint, officers from the Child Protection Services (“<b>CPS</b>”) had visited her at her Parents’ Home on 23 May 2024. On 27 May 2024, CPS informed her that they had closed the matter without the need for a safety plan to be implemented.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     During the hearing, the issue of whether the Wife’s act of vaping in the Daughter’s presence was harmful to the child was hotly contested. Both parties however did not produce clear and unequivocal expert evidence on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Assuming that the issue is answered in the affirmative, I find that there is no necessity for a PPO to be issued against the Wife over her vaping habit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband had produced evidence of <em>only one instance</em> where the Wife had vaped in the child’s presence. That incident occurred about 18 months ago. There is no other evidence that the Wife had vaped in the Daughter’s presence on other occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the parties have been living apart since April 2024. As such, the Husband has no evidential basis to contend that the Wife “is still in possession of vaping devices or could easily purchase them online and use them in [the Daughter’s] presence”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Such a contention is based on pure conjecture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, I note that following the Husband’s complaint about the Wife’s vaping habit, CPS had visited the Parents’ Home, interviewed the Wife, and examined the Daughter’s living environment. CPS had assessed that it is not necessary to take any further action to protect the child. There is no basis for me to reject this assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11 September 2023 – Throwing the Daughter on the bed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Next, I turn to the 11 September incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband’s claim that the Wife had committed family violence is based on a recording from his CCTV camera in a bedroom in the Flat. (The Husband was not at home at the material time.) According to him, the recording shows that at about 12.50 pm, the Wife had handled the Daughter in a rough manner – by “throwing” her on the bed and thus causing her to “bounce” backward on the bed and to land on her head.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Wife denied having intentionally or knowingly caused hurt to the Daughter. According to the Wife, she was merely engaging in horseplay with the child at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I find that the Wife did not commit family violence as alleged by the Husband. The following is clear from the recording –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife did not throw the Daughter on the bed. She had simply placed the child in the middle of the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There were two pillows on the bed. They had been positioned to form a layer of protection around the child. This suggests that the Wife had taken steps to ensure the Daughter’s safety while the latter was on the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After being placed on the bed, the Daughter bent her body backwards <em>on her own.</em> She did not “bounce” backwards from the impact of being forcefully placed on the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After bending backwards, the Daughter’s head and part of her upper body landed on a pillow. There is no evidence that she was hurt or had cried at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">12 September 2023 – Pulling the Daughter’s legs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I now turn to the next incident which is also based on a CCTV recording. The incident occurred in the bedroom on 12 September 2023. Similarly, the Husband was not at home at the material time. The recording shows the Wife and the Daughter on the bed, and the latter crying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     According to the Husband, the Daughter was crying because the Wife had exerted excessive force on the child by pulling her legs back and forth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Wife denied the Husband’s allegations. According to her, the Daughter was crying due to discomfort from constipation. The Wife explained that she was “rotating” the child’s legs – a home remedy – at the material time to relieve the child of her discomfort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Husband has the burden to prove that the Wife had intentionally or knowingly caused hurt to the Daughter by pulling or rotating the child’s legs. In my view, the Husband had failed to discharge his burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife’s evidence that the Daughter was crying due to discomfort from constipation – and not from her moving the child’ legs – is plausible. This is because the Husband had confirmed that the Daughter had constipation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> He was not at home during the incident. As such, he has no basis to dispute the Wife’s evidence that the child was suffering from constipation at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife’s explanation that she was trying to relieve the child of her discomfort from constipation is consistent with the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In the video recording (exhibit R3), the Wife can be seen <em>calmly</em> massaging the child’s stomach and <em>patiently</em> moving her legs at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband had confirmed that to relieve the Daughter of constipation, he would practice home remedies such as “<em>rotating the legs</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and “<em>massaging the stomach</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Even when the Daughter was struggling and pushing against the Wife, the latter was not rough with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The recording does not show the Wife to be angry or frustrated with the Daughter at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, if the Wife had wanted to cause hurt to the Daughter, she would have done so in a more direct way, e.g., by pinching or hitting the child. There is no evidence of this in the recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11 April 2024 – Mark on the Daughter’s leg</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I now come to the final incident relied by the Husband for his PPO application. This concerns a mark found on the Daughter’s leg at around 7.30 pm on 11 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     According to the Husband, the mark was not on the Daughter’s leg earlier that day. He had noticed it only after the child spent the day with the Wife. When questioned, the Wife explained that it was an insect bite. The Husband decided to apply some cream over the mark. The next day, the condition of the mark had worsened. According to the Husband, it became filled with pus and blood was oozing out. When he brought the Daughter to a doctor on 13 April 2024, the Daughter kept mentioning the words “pain” and “fire”. The Husband suspected that the mark was a burn mark and caused by the Wife’s smoking and vaping habit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife denied having caused the mark on the Daughter’s leg.

All that is stated in the doctor’s memo is that the child had a 1 cm x 1 cm erosion with surrounding 2 cm skin induration that was erythematous. The memo also stated that there was no pus or discharge at the time of examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I have no basis to find that the mark was not caused by an insect bite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Looking at the 11 April photo, the mark is consistent with an insect bite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       According to the Wife, it was “<em>pretty normal</em>” for the Daughter to be bitten by insects.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband did not dispute this piece of evidence during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Wife had proactively alerted the Husband to the mark on 11 April 2024. It is unlikely that she would have done so if she had burnt the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Further</em>, the Husband has failed to show why the Wife would want to intentionally or knowingly burn the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Finally</em>, assuming that the Daughter did utter the words “fire” and “pain” (this is hotly contested by the Wife), this does not prove that the Wife had burnt the child’s leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is conceivable that the child might have been describing how the pain <em>felt</em> – i.e., like being burned – instead of stating that “fire” was the <em>cause</em> of the pain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       It also bears highlighting that the Daughter had allegedly mentioned the words “fire” and “pain” at the doctor’s office on 13 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> This is two days after the discovery of the mark. In the time between the discovery of the mark and the visit to the doctor’s office, both the Husband and the Wife had applied medicinal cream to the mark. According to the Husband, one day after he had applied the cream, pus and blood started oozing from it. In the circumstances, I cannot exclude the possibility that the <em>medicinal cream</em> and the <em>subsequent</em> worsening of the condition of the mark had caused the Daughter to feel the sensation of fire on her leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     To sum up – I find that the Husband has failed to prove that the Wife had committed family violence against the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     For the above reasons, I granted the Wife’s application for a PPO for herself and dismissed the rest of the PPO applications by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I order that the Husband is not to use family violence in any form against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The PPO shall take immediate effect and shall last until the Daughter turns 21. In other words, the order will expire one day before XX March 2043.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In determining the duration of the PPO, I have considered (i) the applicable principles (see <em>XEF v XEG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 92</a> at [43]) and (ii) the fact that child-related issues were the trigger for the Husband’s commission of family violence. Such issues are likely to persist so long as the parties can exercise parental rights over the Daughter: see [47(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I wish to emphasise to the Husband a few things. <em>First</em>, it is an offence to contravene the order that I have made. <em>Second</em>, if the Husband were to intentionally contravene the order, he can be arrested and be punished with a fine and/or imprisonment. <em>Finally</em>, for the sake of his Daughter, I urge the Husband to resolve any future disagreement that he may have with the Wife calmly and through legal means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Finally, I come to the issue of costs. The Wife has succeeded in one of her PPO applications while the Husband has failed in his. In my view, a costs order of $3,000 in favour of the Wife is proportionate to the amount of work and effort expended on litigating the family violence committed on 26 April 2024 and 17 June 2024. I make this cost order accordingly.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s affidavit dated 3 July 2024 (in relation to SS 806/2024) at [29] to [41].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 29 August 2024 at [16] to [19]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 17 October 2024 at page 6 (line 27) to page 7 (line 8).

class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband and the Wife are both professionals in the same industry. The Husband holds a senior appointment in a multinational corporation, where he manages around 70 personnel, and with them collectively generate an annual revenue of about US$39 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties have 2 sons (collectively, the “children”), who were born in 2007 and 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In FC/D 1265/2024, the Wife was granted an Interim Judgment on 4 April 2024 on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down by reason that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. The Interim Judgment was made final when the Certificate of Final Judgment was issued on 8 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment were orders on divorce ancillary matters that were made by consent. Clause 3(c) relates to the division of the matrimonial home. Clause 3(d) relates to the division of other matrimonial assets, including a property in Singapore, 2 properties in London, monies standing to the credit of the parties in their Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts, monies in various bank accounts, stocks and shares held by the parties in their sole names, and monies from Treasury Bills and fixed deposits. Clause 3(e) relates to spousal maintenance for the Wife, and the giving to the Wife of 50% of the bonus and shares allocated to the Husband for his performance in 2023. Clause 3(f) relates to maintenance for the children, annual contributions by the Husband to the Wife’s joint account with the children, and the nomination of the children as beneficiaries of the parties’ life insurance policies and CPF monies. Clause 3(g) relates to the following matters: (a) payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses; (b) the parties’ agreed mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance, and household expenses, if there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment; (c) the provision of a 3.5% “inflationary adjustment” every year for the amount of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses; (d) the repayment by the Husband to the Wife of an amount withdrawn from the parties’ joint account; and (e) the Husband’s sole liability for all personal loans taken in his own name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under the consent orders, the Husband agreed to pay the Wife spousal maintenance of $7,500 every month from January 2024 to January 2034 (or until the Husband’s official retirement, whichever is later), $3,400 every month for the maintenance of the children from January 2024 until the children completed their university education, and $3,800 every month for household expenses from January 2024 to January 2032, with these amounts to increase by 3.5% every year (unless otherwise agreed between the parties). In addition, the Husband agreed to make an annual contribution of $100,000 to the Wife’s joint account with the children for 5 years, from 2024 to 2028 (both years inclusive).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband’s case is set out in detail in his affidavit filed in support of the application, and summarised in his oral submissions. The Husband seeks to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment, and clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment, on the ground that “the clauses impose unfair and unjust terms that have a negative impact on [him], which [he] did not fully understand at the point of consenting, due to the pressure put on [him] by the [Wife] to sign the divorce papers”. The Husband added that he “did not have the benefit of legal advice at the material time” as he was “self-representing / acting in person”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       According to the Husband, throughout the marriage, he had been the “primary financial contributor to the family” and “paid for most of the family’s expenses”. His current job was fast paced, with long hours and significant responsibilities that often left him feeling overwhelmed by work commitments. The Wife took on “familial duties”, including “managing [the Husband’s] salary / income”, which the Husband paid into the parties’ joint bank account, and “using [the Husband’s] monies to pay for the family’s expenses and to make investments”. The Husband was given about $2,000 every month to pay for his personal expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband claimed that he signed the draft consent order on divorce ancillary matters “without seeking legal help or advice” due to pressure from the Wife and “overwhelming stress ... at work”. According to the Husband, the Wife “pushed [him] to sign the documents in a rushed manner”, despite the Husband informing her many times that he needed more time to review them and come to a decision, especially with his heavy workload and stress. Due to pressure and threats by the Wife, the Husband “only focused on the key aspects, such as the Joint Custody of [the] children and the access [he] had with them”. As for the other orders, the Husband “did not have sufficient time and / or the capacity to fully understand what [he] was signing”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband provided the following elaboration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     When the Husband consented to the terms of the draft consent order, he was “extremely affected by the fact that the marriage was ending on a bad note”, and was “extremely worried and concerned about the impact this would have on the Children”. He wanted to resolve the matter amicably without involving lawyers, and trusted the Wife to be cooperative, fair and reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had “made threats during the negotiations that, if [the Husband] did not agree to her terms, she would go on to expose the Third Party and name / involve the Third Party in the Divorce proceedings”. This “Third Party”, with whom the Husband had an extramarital affair, was a woman “of a certain seniority” in his industry. The Husband was concerned that the Wife’s exposure of the Third Party would “cause major reputational loss” to the Third Party and to him. To ensure that the Third Party “does not get pulled into [the parties’] divorce proceedings”, and that the jobs of the Husband and the Third Party “don’t end up being at stake”, the Husband signed the draft consent order “despite not completely agreeing to its terms and without fully understanding the implications it will have on [him]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife also threatened to deny the Husband access to the children, when he made counterproposals during the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband was “under tremendous pressure at work and felt overwhelmed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Collectively, these issues “weighed heavily on [the Husband’s] mind and clouded [his] judgment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband also claimed that “due to [his] lack of expertise in the management of the funds used for the family expenses, [he] was unaware of the various costs associated with living on [his] own”, and underestimated his living expenses. The Husband claimed that after paying off his monthly expenses and the amounts payable to the Wife pursuant to the Interim Judgment, the Husband was “in a deficit” and “financially drained”. The Husband also stated that he had “little to no savings” to allocate towards commitments such as purchasing a home, saving for retirement and managing his health, despite working long hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband claimed that the consent orders were unfair to him, having regard to his larger direct financial contributions to the matrimonial assets. He also claimed that the Respondent was a capable and well-paid individual who earned close to $300,000 a year, and therefore did not require the the amount of spousal maintenance that she demanded. He wanted the Wife to bear part of the children’s maintenance and household expenses. He also stated that the yearly inflationary adjustment was not sustainable, as he was reaching the ceiling of his career and was unlikely to have any significant salary increments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the Wife’s affidavit in reply, the Wife gave details of the breakdown of the marriage and the negotiations that followed. The Wife claimed that the negotiations were fair, and that she had acted reasonably in the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     However, the Wife also admitted to intentionally making things difficult for the Husband by suggesting that she would name the Third Party as a co-defendant in the divorce. It was clear from the Wife’s evidence on the negotiations that the Wife knew of the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the Wife used this to her advantage in the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Wife denied withholding access to the children, or using the children as a bargaining tool. She explained that the discussion relied on by the Husband took place when she “was still trying to recover and heal, and [she] genuinely could not bring [herself] to communicate with him about the children”. I think there is some truth to this statement, as the Husband did not raise any issue in relation to the consent orders in the Interim Judgment on custody, care and control of, and access to, the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In relation to the Husband’s suggestion that he could not afford the monthly payments for maintenance and household expenses, the Wife claimed that the Husband’s monthly income was between $30,000 and $40,000, and his annual income (presumably including bonuses) was between $600,000 and $700,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s application to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment was bound to fail. As observed by Choo Han Teck J in <em>VQB v VQC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25713-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 5</a> at [14] and [16]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In a divorce case, the Final Judgment dissolves the marriage, and the status of the parties as a married couple is brought to a permanent and unsalvageable end. Once the Final Judgment is made, the marriage is at a permanent end and cannot be reinstated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Women’s Charter 1961 makes no provision for setting aside a Final Judgment. The only conceivable exception is when the Final Judgment was obtained by fraud; but even then, it may have to be a fraud that taints the Final Judgment itself, such as a forgery of the order of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Setting up the Interim Judgment for attack is futile once the Final Judgment is made. To hold that a Final Judgment may be rescinded if the Interim Judgment was flawed is to create a legal fiction. The reliefs and remedies for obtaining a flawed Interim Judgment lie elsewhere than to pretend that the Final Judgment has no effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In any case, the Husband’s complaint lies not with the granting of the divorce, but with the terms of the consent order on divorce ancillary matters. The Husband affirmed the Interim Judgment for divorce by asking for a Case Conference to be fixed for directions to be given to the parties to file and exchange their affidavits of assets and means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders dealing with the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Section 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 deals with the power of the court to order the division of matrimonial assets. Under section 112(4), the court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under section 112, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0068.xml')\">[2012] SGCA 68</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a>, the Court of Appeal made the following observations at [11], [12], [15], [22], [23], [25] and [27] to [30]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Section 112(4) does not furnish the court with a <em>carte blanche</em> to vary an order on division of matrimonial assets. There must be exceptional reasons before such variation can be effected. There must be some finality once the matrimonial assets have been divided between the parties. Section 112(4) must have a limited operation only, especially when the order of court made under section 112 is premised upon a consent order entered into between the parties themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Once the order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets has been completely implemented or spent (inasmuch as everything that is required to be done has been effected and the assets concerned have in fact been distributed to the parties concerned), the court does not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. Section 112(4) was included to give administrative flexibility to the court so long as the order it has made has not been completely effected or implemented. The court would make the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets only where the order was unworkable or has become unworkable (before it has been fully effected or implemented).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where an order becomes unworkable (in that it is a matter of practical impossibility to implement it), it is fair and reasonable that the court is empowered under section 112(4) to make the necessary variations. There will also be (albeit extremely limited) circumstances in which unworkability, understood in a substantive as well as purposive sense, will justify a variation of the order by the court. Where new circumstances have emerged since the order was made, which so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something that is radically different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability, and the court would make the necessary variations to deal with such unworkability. Another instance of a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability may arise after the court makes an order under section 112 that is of a continuing nature. Where there has been a change in circumstances invalidating the very basis on which the court made a continuing order, this amounts to a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability, and the court will be empowered to make the necessary variation (or indeed, extension, revocation or discharge) under section 112(4) to deal with such a change. The view that a material change in the circumstances would suffice to trigger a variation under section 112(4) sets too low a threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Section 112(4) may also be invoked to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets where such order was unworkable to begin with. Any <em>ab initio</em> substantive unworkability must be a result of a fundamental misunderstanding apparent on the face of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>(e)     One other situation that might justify varying an order for the division of matrimonial assets, even after the order concerned has been implemented, is fraud. The standard of proof for fraud is a very high one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Court of Appeal provided the following elaboration on the fraud exception in <em>BMI v BMJ and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20978-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 63</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21291-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 43</a> at [3] and [5]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As the court has no power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets that has been fully implemented, except in the limited case of fraud, any non-disclosure that was not fraudulent would not furnish a basis to set aside a consent order for the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fact that the consent order has been fully implemented and the subsequent lapse of time are not factors which would, by themselves, prevent the court from intervening on the basis of section 112(4) if there was cogent evidence of fraudulent and material non-disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The threshold for establishing fraud is a high one which will not be met unless there is cogent and compelling evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     None of the reasons given by the Husband for seeking to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment fell within the ambit of section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961, as explained by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> and in <em>BMI v BMJ and another matter</em>. The consent orders for division of matrimonial assets were clearly workable. In fact, at the time of the hearing, some of those orders had already been implemented, while others were in the process of being implemented. There was no evidence of fraud or fraudulent non-disclosure by the Wife in relation to the obtaining of the consent orders. While the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the pressures experienced by the Husband at work, may have given the Wife an upper hand in the negotiation of the terms of the consent orders, those matters did not in any way affect the validity of those consent orders. It follows that the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment must be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside clauses 3(e) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Clauses 3(e) and 3(f) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders dealing with maintenance for the Wife and maintenance for the children, respectively. Clause 3(g)(i), (ii) and (iii) was a consent order that provided for, among other things, the following matters: (a) payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses; (b) the parties’ agreed mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, if there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment; and (c) the provision of a 3.5% “inflationary adjustment” every year for the amount of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Section 118 of the Women’s Charter 1961 provides for the power of the court to vary (or rescind) an order for spousal maintenance granted during matrimonial proceedings. Under section 118, the court may at any time vary or rescind any such order for spousal maintenance “where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Sections 72 and 127(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961, read together, provide for the power of the court to rescind or vary an order for child maintenance granted during matrimonial proceedings. Under those provisions, the court may rescind or vary the order for child maintenance “on proof of a change in the circumstances” of the parent ordered to pay the maintenance, or of the child receiving the maintenance, or “for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court”. In considering any such application, the court may take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I begin with the following preliminary observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The order for payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses may be construed as a supplementary order for a combination of spousal maintenance and child maintenance. It is open to the parties to agree to supplement the primary orders for spousal maintenance and child maintenance with an order for the payment of the whole or a part of the household expenses that would have been incurred for the maintenance of the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Although the parties may have agreed on a mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, that agreement did not oust the application of the relevant statutory provisions on spousal maintenance and child maintenance. Clause 3(g)(ii) of the Interim Judgment only applies in a case where there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment. It did not prevent the Husband from applying to vary the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, in reliance on section 118, and section 72 read with section 127(2), of the Women’s Charter 1961, in any other case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Husband did not point to any specific misrepresentation by the Wife, or any mistake of fact (whether by himself, by the Wife or by both of them), that would justify a recission or variation of the consent order on spousal maintenance. There was also no evidence of any material change in the circumstances (whether of the Husband, the Wife or the children), between the date of the Interim Judgment (4 April 2024) and the date of the hearing of the Husband’s application (28 February 2025), that would justify a variation in the agreed amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses. As mentioned in the context of the Husband’s unsuccessful attempt to set aside the consent orders on the division of matrimonial assets, while the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the pressures experienced by the Husband at work, may have given the Wife an upper hand in the negotiation of the terms of the consent orders, those matters did not in any way affect the validity of those consent orders. It follows that the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Interim Judgment must likewise be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Clause 3(g)(iv) and (v) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders for: (a) the repayment by the Husband to the Wife of an amount withdrawn from the parties’ joint account; and (b) the Husband to be solely liable for all personal loans taken in his own name. None of the parties’ submissions were directed at clause 3(g)(iv) and (v). As there did not appear to be any basis to set aside clause 3(g)(iv) and (v), the Husband’s application to set aside clause 3(g)(iv) and (v) of the Interim Judgment is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     While I have declined to set aside the consent orders in relation to the payment of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, I do not discount the possibility that the amounts payable for those matters, when increased by 3.5% each year, may at some time in the future be unsustainable on the Husband’s income. To illustrate how this may happen, in 2024, the total amount payable by the Husband each month under clause 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i) of the Interim Judgment was $14,700 (comprising $7,500 for spousal maintenance, $3,400 for child maintenance and $3,800 for household expenses). This will increase to $15,214.50 per month in 2025, $15,747.01 per month in 2026, $16,298.15 per month in 2027, and 16,868.59 per month in 2028. I therefore clarify that if the monthly payments become so large as to be unsustainable on the Husband’s income, or there is any other material change in the circumstances of the Husband, the Wife or the children or any other good cause, my dismissal of the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i) of the Interim Judgment does not preclude the Husband from applying, under the relevant statutory provisions, to vary the consent orders for payment of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the circumstances, the Husband’s application is dismissed. As a consequence of the dismissal of the Husband’s applications to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment and clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment, the Husband’s remaining prayers for the fixing of a Case Conference and for costs are also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife’s solicitor sought costs of $5,000 all in, inclusive of filing fees totalling $303.90. The Husband’s 59 page affidavit had 20 pages of text, while the Wife’s 127 page affidavit had 22 pages of text. The hearing of the Originating Application lasted about an hour. All things considered, I order the Husband to pay the Wife costs of the application fixed at $1,800 (all in).</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife","Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2025-03-12","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1582 of 2023","title":"XJS v XJT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 27","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32975-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Lee Mong Jen and Mr Yeo Yang (LMJ Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Mr Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran (Prestige Legal LLP) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-03-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>XJS v XJT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XJS <em>v</em> XJT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32975-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 27</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1582 of 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">12 March 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kenneth Yap </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Lee Mong Jen and Mr Yeo Yang (LMJ Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; Mr Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran (Prestige Legal LLP) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XJS — XJT </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">12 March 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are my brief grounds of decision for the ancillary matters (“AM”) in D 1582/2023.

The Husband’s argument that the HUS Invest Funds should be excluded because the Wife had received and spent her entitlements under the Connect Plan (a reward scheme for teachers under the Ministry of Education) is not legally valid. The HUS Invest Funds are a chose in action and therefore have an asset worth which can be valued at the ancillary hearing. The latest valuation provided by the Husband is as at 1 April 2024, in the sum of $202,047.82. The Wife sought to extrapolate the estimated increase in value as at January 2025. I instead directed the Husband to provide the latest statement to adopt the most accurate value, which was provided during the hearing as <b><u>$219,799.83</u></b>, based on a statement dated September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Second, the Husband makes a further argument that the Wife’s Connect Plan received payments over the years have been dissipated by her, and that the correct treatment should be the return of such funds to the matrimonial pool. However, I agree with counsel for the Wife that there is no legal basis for alleging dissipation when the divorce was not imminent. The divorce application was filed on 6 April 2023, and the Wife had explained that the monies had been spent over the years on family expenses and the purchase of the matrimonial home. I would not therefore require the Wife to refund any component of the spent monies to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Third, regarding bank balances, as these should be valued at the time of the interim judgment, the Husband’s transfers of $8,000 to his sister’s bank account on 16 October and 15 November 2023 respectively should not be taken into account, as it is stated by his sister that the sums are for expenses incurred from October 2023 to February 2025, which are expenses post-interim judgment. Accordingly, the valuation of the Husband’s bank accounts should be taken at the time of interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Fourth, with regard to insurance policies, the Wife claims that there were three insurance policies taken out by the Husband for the benefit of the children which had matured during the marriage but were not accounted, and which should be added back into the asset pool. The details of these three policies are as follows:</p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.0898179635927%\"><col width=\"32.0664132826565%\"><col width=\"18.8437687537507%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Policies (Child)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Matured Value Amount</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>As at date</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">LXXXX0975 (KS) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$ 4,141.87 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21-Jan-20 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">LXXXX0991 (KS) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$ 4,942.88 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">22-Jan-21 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">PruEduSave XXXX6162 (PTK) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$15,831.50 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">12-Sep-22 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$ 24,916.25</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     At the hearing, parties agreed that these three policies in the Husband’s name that were received by him would be paid out to the children accordingly, and that the Wife’s policy AIA Smart Growth 18 LXXXXX4480, which is still being paid for by her and which has not yet matured, would be paid out to PTK at maturity. Parties also agreed that the insurance policies paid to PTK would be utilised towards her outstanding student loan incurred in the sum of $34,500 as at September 2024. The total payout from the Husband’s PruEduSave Policy No XXXX6162 ($15,831.50) and the Wife’s AIA Smart Growth 18 LXXXXX4480 policy ($21,745 at present) would approximately cover the outstanding student loan with interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition, the Wife seeks the return of the monies paid out under the Wife’s Prudential Policy No. XXXX6964 on 14 November 2022 of $1,000 into their joint account, which was withdrawn by the Husband. She claims that the divorce was imminent at this point, and that substantive sums withdrawn from the asset pool should be returned (per <em>TNL v TNK</em> [2017 1 SLR 609 at [24]]. It was agreed at the first hearing that the Husband would repay the Wife separately for this, and this consent agreement would be reflected for good order in the ancillary hearing orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Fifth, parties dispute the valuation of the matrimonial home at [address redacted], an executive condominium. The Wife values it as <b>$1,796,000</b>, a figure taken from the average of three similar sized mid floor units using URA Resale Transacted prices (PAM-1 at page 157). The Husband seeks to adopt a valuation of $2,052,500.00 based on a latest transaction on 3 October 2024, which was found in the PropNex report dated 10 January 2025 (see the Defendant’s Written Submissions at Tab A). I found it more reliable to rely on the most recent estimated sale price of <b><u>$2,052.500</u></b>, and adopted this figure for the purposes of computation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As regards the housing loan for the matrimonial home, the Wife estimates this to be $584,459.20 as at January 2025 (extrapolated from the last statement entered into evidence as at 27 March 2024), whereas the Husband provided in submissions the latest statement as at 27 December 2024, which puts the sum as <u>$585,509.49</u><b>.</b> The Husband’s figure will be adopted as

Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband submitted for a 50-50 ratio for indirect contributions at the hearing, noting that the Mother had a helper who contributed towards the management of the household and raising of the children. The Wife’s position was that indirect contributions should be 75-25 in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife contended that her indirect financial contributions had been consistent, substantial, and regular. Given the Husband's frequent travel during much of the marriage, she bore the primary financial responsibility for maintaining the household of six, paying for all essential and incidental expenses. These included consistent and significant contribution to the matrimonial properties throughout the marriage, which including taking out two staff renovation loans (which she repaid monthly), along with town council charges and utility bills. She also purchased household equipment which benefited the household, took on personal credit loans to meet the family’s needs, and stepped in as guarantor to her daughter’s university study loan. Finally, she also covered much of the daily household expenses, including service charges, utilities, groceries, dining out, cultural and festive expenses, children’s expenses such as pocket money, food, groceries, medical consultation and treatments, and the salary as well as agent fees for the family’s domestic helper. The Wife also points out that although a Joint Account had been set up since 2018, into which the parties deposited $1,500 monthly, she alleges that the Husband would reimburse himself from that account for bills that he paid, thereby draining out monies from their joint account and keeping the balance to a minimum, which in turn rendered it insufficient to cover daily costs. With regard to KS’s overseas education in Gold Coast, Australia, the Wife stated that she had financed the travel to Australia to facilitate her son’s settlement into the university, paying for part of the air tickets, car rental charges, Airbnb accommodation, and food expenses incurred by KS and herself during the trip, which amounted to a sum of $3,227.96. She also paid for other holiday trips and travel expenses during the course of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband set out in paragraph 18 of DAM-3, at Tabs A-F, the sums which he claimed to pay for. Over the period of 2017 to 2023, he claimed to have paid $240,301.81 in total as indirect financial contributions towards family expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife submits that that even based on the figures provided by the Husband, his monthly contribution to household expenses was low.

It is also plainly evident from the Wife’s calculations above that the Husband had only contributed a minority share towards the indirect financial contributions. Accordingly, I considered that a broad brush figure in the region of 65-70% would have been the approximate percentage of indirect contributions by the Wife. On balance, I awarded <b><u>68% to the Wife, and 32% to the Husband</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Average Ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I made no adjustments to the average ratio as parties did not request for any adjustments to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband asked for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Wife for failing to answer questions on her assets in her response to his interrogatories on specific withdrawals. I did not find this to be justified as the questions related to relatively small line items in the Wife’s bank accounts. Accordingly, I declined to draw such an adverse inference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     On the Wife’s part, she asked for an uplift of 5% of the total pool of assets on account of the Husband’s erratic and intimidating behaviour towards her, which caused her mental distress over five years. However, I did not find the alleged conduct to be sufficiently serious to warrant such an adjustment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The parties’ respective share of the matrimonial pool are therefore computed as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.3266653330666%\"><col width=\"33.3266653330666%\"><col width=\"33.3466693338668%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PW</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DH</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Direct Contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">46.5%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">53.5%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Indirect Contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">68%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">32%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Average Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>57.25%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>42.75%</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total Matrimonial Assets</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$2,812,709.08</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Share of Matrimonial Pool</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$1,610, 275.95</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$1,202,433.13</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mechanics of Division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I adjourned the hearing to allow parties to submit how best to effect an equitable division given the value and percentages ascribed above.

The Husband currently has sufficient balance in his CPF Ordinary Account to effect this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Husband’s counsel did not raise objections to this proposal, and I accordingly direct that this method of distribution be applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For the avoidance of doubt, pending completion of sale of the matrimonial home, parties should pay in equal shares all outgoings related to the property, including the housing loan, utilities, broadband services, management and sinking fund charges and property tax. Neither party should terminate services to the matrimonial home which are under their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     With respect to the motor car, the Wife should have full conduct of the sale and the Husband should hand over the vehicle and keys in working condition to the Wife’s possession within two weeks of the order made in this hearing. Should the Husband elect to take over ownership of the car, he should notify the Wife within one week of the order, pay her $14,704.09 and solely discharge the outstanding hire purchase loan within two weeks of this Order. Failing which, the Husband should hand over the vehicle and car keys to the Wife as stated therein. Pending sale or transfer of the car to his name, Husband should continue paying for the hire purchase instalment and all costs related to the car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Wife submitted that at present, she provides $4,691.09 towards PTK’s monthly expenses, while the Husband provides $1,460.79. She submits that going forward, the Husband should pay <u>70%</u> of monthly expenses for PTK, which is estimated at <b>A$4,904</b> once PTK attends university in Brisbane, Australia. It was explained that the Husband should bear a higher proportion of maintenance going forward as he had under-provided during the earlier years, and the Wife also has medical issues for which she has to incur expenditure in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife also asks for backdated maintenance of <b>$19,449.82</b> from April 2023 to October 2024, and a monthly sum of $653.20 thereafter each month from November 2024 to the date of hearing. This is because she had to shift out to her sister’s residence, on account of the Husband’s alleged family violence, and PTK wanted to move out as well (see paragraph 139 of PAM-2). This sum was adjusted at hearing to <b>$20,749.82</b>, as counsel for the Wife had omitted to include the cost of clothes and shoes from the month of October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the mode of payment towards PTK’s expenses, the Wife proposed that this be by way of direct transfer from the Husband to PTK, so she would not have to chase for payments. For big-ticket items for which she had paid in advance, the Wife would seek reimbursement after submitting the relevant receipt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, the Wife also sought spousal maintenance for a period of 12 months to allow her to transition and get her finances in order, should the Court not be prepared to grant her backdated maintenance, as she had spent nearly all of her money paying for the family’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     With regard to backdated maintenance, the Husband disputed the sum of $4,691.09 as representative of PTK’s monthly expenses. Specifically, he disputed her half-share of household expenses in the sum of $1,172.62, and objected to the following categories of items, which he said should only be reimbursed upon provision of proof of payment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Special Moisturizer $177.12</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Medical and Dental $175</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Computer, mobile phone and digital $150</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Scalp Treatment $156</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Entertainment $100</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_f\"></a>(f)     School-related expenses $200</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Clothes and shoes $200</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Holidays $208</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Massage recovery $340</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I did not find that the Wife’s stated household expenses of $2,345.24, for which a half share of $1,172.62 was payable on PTK’s account, to be excessive. These included groceries ($500), wet market purchases ($200), domestic helper costs ($700), water utilities ($270), electricity utilities ($270) and MCST fee ($396.76). These appear to be normal household costs which I did not find to be unreasonable. As for the specific line items that are objected to subject to proof being provided, my views are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Special Moisturizer $177.12 – Evidence is provided in paragraph 84 of the Wife’s 2nd AOM affidavit (PAM-2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Medical and Dental $175 – This is a reasonable figure and will not be adjusted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Computer, mobile phone and digital $150 – this extrapolates to $1,800 a year for all digital devices, and is not adjusted as it appears to be reasonable for a polytechnic student.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Scalp Treatment $156 – Evidence is provided in paragraph 84 of Wife’s 2nd AOM affidavit (PAM-2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Entertainment $100 – Not adjusted as this sum is reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_f\"></a>(f)     School-related expenses $200 – Not adjusted as this sum is reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Clothes and shoes $200 – <u>Adjusted downwards by $100</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Holidays $208 – this sum amounts to $2,496 a year, and is not unreasonable for expenditure on one or two holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Massage recovery $340 – The Wife explains that these treatments are needed as PTK plays netball. The rate per session is $70, per page 411 of PAM-2. Husband’s position on this is that it should be $200 per month. <u>I reduced this figure by $130 to $210 per month</u>, on the basis that it would be fair to allow three sessions per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Applying these adjustments to the figures, the reduction of $50 for the Husband’s share of clothes and shoes applies across all 19 months from April 2023 to October 2024 (i.e. a reduction of $950). The reduction of $65 per month for the Husband’s share of massage recovery services applies for six months (from April 2023 to September 2023, as thereafter the Husband paid for his share of medical and massage costs on proof of receipt), and would amount to a reduction of $390. Accordingly, the total backdated maintenance should be reduced by $1,340, to a total of $19,409.82 for April 2023 to October 2024. For the months of November and December 2024, the Wife’s initial position was that the outstanding sum per month would be $653.20, which the Husband did not dispute. A further sum of $50 representing the Husband’s share of monthly expenses on clothing and shoes was added to this monthly figure, as the Wife’s counsel explained that this line item had been accidentally omitted from the Wife’s computation (the sum of $50 being half of the adjusted figure of $100 for clothing and shoes as explained above). Hence, I added $703.20 per month for November and December 2024, rendering the total backdated maintenance to be <b><u>$20,816.22</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Turning to future maintenance, the Husband’s position was that he is willing to share PTK’s maintenance equally, subject to proof of expenditure, especially for accommodation, mobile phone and internet line, school related expenses and clothing for different seasons (see page 35 of the Husband’s Written Submissions). This was premised on his position that he retains the entirety of his HUS Invest Funds when he retires upon reaching 56 years of age (which he does so retain in view of the division of assets decided above). By contrast, as mentioned above, the Wife estimated the monthly maintenance to be A$4,904, based on a guide provided by the university as to living expenses for students in Brisbane, and asked that the Husband pay 70% of this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Having considered the parties’ positions, I apportioned the share of maintenance payable by the husband as 55%, in direct proportion to the relative nett monthly income of the Husband and the Wife ($9,779.44 vs $7,946.00). However, as the Husband would reach the retirement age applicable to the police force at 57 years (i.e. 27 December 2026), I reduced his share to 50% effective from January 2027, in recognition of the fact that he would likely earn less in a post-retirement job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As to the quantum of monthly maintenance for PTK, I did not find the Husband’s proposal that all expenses should be accompanied by proof to be reasonable or sustainable. It would be invidious and oppressive to require the daughter to come up with receipts for every single item of expenditure. Instead, I adjourned the hearing for parties to consider what a baseline cost would be, and for larger ticket items to be resolved in the proportion decided by the court upon proof of expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     At the resumed hearing, parties updated that they agreed to the following baseline costs for PTK:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Allowance – A$400,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Laundry – A$64,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Mobile phone and internet line – A$35,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Toiletries – A$100, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_e\"></a>(e)     School related expenses – A$100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Parties disagreed on the cost of food, transport and clothing. My decision on these items is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With regard to food, the Wife’s position was that the monthly cost should be A$1,568, as recommended by the student guide provided by the university. The Husband’s position was that this should be A$400, on the basis that breakfast is provided as part of the accommodation cost and that meals can be cooked. As breakfast is provided, I discounted the recommended monthly cost of food from A$1,578 to A$1,100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to transport, the Wife’s position was that this should be A$200, while the Husband claimed it should be A$100 as the accommodation is a ten minute walk from the school. I considered that public transportation to locations other than the school would be a necessity for a student, and apportioned this sum midway between the parties’ positions at A$150.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to clothing, the Husband’s position was that this should be zero as he had already purchased sufficient clothing for the daughter (he noted that her course would end in June 2026), and any specific purchase should be claimed on a reimbursement basis. The Wife took the view that A$200 is a fair sum, and pointed out that it was she who had bought much of the daughter’s clothing. I allocated A$100 a month for smaller ticket purchases, with larger ticket clothing purchases to be claimed ad-hoc on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Based on what I had determined and what parties had agreed to, the baseline monthly maintenance for PTK would be A$2,049. Other larger-ticket expenditure should be specifically claimed on a reimbursement basis, such as accommodation (fixed at A$1,556 for every 4 weeks, subject to adjustment if revised), as well as clothing, school related expenses in excess of what is specified in the baseline, airfare, furniture, furnishings, purchases of digital devices, costs of opening bank account, medical and dental expenses. These large-ticket expenses should be payable directly by the parents in the proportion I had specified above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     For the avoidance of doubt, the baseline maintenance is to continue even if the daughter is in Singapore for the holidays, given that that such periods are short and variable, and it would be difficult to compute the exact quantum of costs that would accrue to the daughter over such short periods. All payments are also to be made directly to PTK’s bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Finally, no spousal maintenance is to be provided as the Wife had been working and was financially independent for the entire marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I heard parties on costs subsequent to the delivery of my brief grounds. The Wife asked for costs on an indemnity basis at $20,000, on the basis that a without prejudice offer had been made to the Husband on 4 December 2023, after mediation and exchange of financial documents, which was less favourable in terms of the division percentage than what had been granted by this court. Counsel for the Wife argued that the matter had been protracted unnecessarily by the Husband, with the hearing of these ancillary proceedings spanning three sessions, and a total of 19 affidavits filed by both parties in the course of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Counsel for the Husband strenuously objected to any costs being ordered, and contended that parties could not agree because key items were outstanding and disputed, including the valuation of the matrimonial home. He also noted that additional affidavits from the domestic helper were filed at the last minute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I considered parties’ submissions and noted that while the usual costs order in ancillary proceedings is for parties to bear their own costs, costs may nevertheless be ordered against a party who had been unreasonable and had caused delays and further costs to be incurred (<em>WRX v WRY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31799-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 22</a>, at [75]). In the present case, I took the view that the order of costs should be set at a level that would sufficiently instil discipline in proceedings and avoid unnecessary litigation. This case could have been resolved as far back as December 2023, when a more favourable without prejudice offer had been made to the Husband. Instead, the Husband chose to dispute individual line items and payments to a minutiae of detail, which added unnecessarily to the complexity and duration of these ancillary proceedings. It also bears noting that the Wife prevailed on a significantly greater number of contested issues in these proceedings than the Husband. For these reasons, I ordered the Husband to pay costs to the Wife, fixed at $10,000 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The ancillary orders are granted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Division of matrimonial assets</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    By Consent, paragraphs (a)-(d) are ordered as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    In relation to the payout from PruEduSave Policy No. XXXX6162, the Husband shall pay the sum of <b>S$15,831.50</b> to the designated bank account of PTK upon the commencement of her overseas education in Australia.

Both children are attending local schools.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The husband filed a writ for divorce in July 2018. Interim judgment was granted on 5 March 2019. The contested ancillary matters (AM) were heard on 16 and 19 September 2019. I reserved decision and delivered the AM orders on 8 October 2019 with clarifications on 9 and 14 October 2019. Final judgement was extracted on 23 December 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The father appealed the AM orders in their entirety and the appeal was heard before the High Court Family Division. The High Court also dealt with related summonses in HCF/DCA 127/2019, HCF/SUM 289/2019, HCF/SUM 324/2019, HCF/SUM 55/2020, HCF/RAS 10/2020, HCF/SUM 163/2020, HCF/SUM 244/2020, HCF/RAS 27/2020, HCF/SUM 340/2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The High Court made orders on 11 March 2021. In rendering his decision, the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon (as he then was) made the following remarks which I set out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“141  Before concluding, I add the following remarks. Once the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance in the divorce issues are resolved, the parties should give serious consideration to becoming more accommodating towards each other in dealing with the matters concerning the Children, rather than continuously utilising their forensic skills to seek resolution in court all the time. This is especially so when the matters in dispute are administrative and not legal in nature. Moreover, as the Children grow up day by day, and enter different stages of their lives, such as beginning formal education, adjustments would necessarily have to be made to the current orders. Handling such adjustments in a more amicable way cannot be but in the best interests of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">142    When last counted, there were 26 summonses filed in D 3162, the divorce suit. There were four appeals to the High Court Family Division from decisions in the Family Court, in which a total of four summonses have been filed. There was also an originating summons filed in the Family Court concerning the permanent relocation of the Children, and an originating summons filed in the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal the decision in RAS 10. All these were filed since July 2018, less than three years ago. The Children were aged three and one then, and are now six and four years old, respectively. They will reach majority at 18 in 12 to 14 years. It is a very heavy burden for parties to bear if they continue to choose to resolve disputes for the remaining of those years in the manner and at the rate they have chosen so far. I accept that the Children are still very young and may not now understand the conflicts taking place between the parties. But they will grow up and soon discover what is taking place between their parents. The conflicts will affect them, and it is not fair to them to be made to bear the same heavy burden as well.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Notwithstanding this advice, after the conclusion of the appeal in March 2021, the parties filed 41 applications and 505 affidavits between April 2021 and December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The children were aged 3 and 1 when the divorce proceedings started. They are now turning 10 and 8 respectively. The marriage was contracted in July 2011 and ended in Interim Judgment in March 2019 subsisting some 8 years. But at the rate of the litigation parties decide to embroil in, the years they spend in litigation will soon outstrip the length of the marriage in no time. Indeed, these children have spent much of their childhood thus far with parents mired in litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     This latest appeal by the mother is a case in point. I have set out the crux of the appeal which is the mother’s dissatisfaction over what she perceived as her entitled time with the children over 3 dates: 4 October 2024, 31 August 2024 and 1 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Before setting out the reasons for my decision, I also refer parties to <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> in which the Appellate Division (the AD) gave guidance to parties that parents should, in considering their children’s changing needs, exercise grace and flexibility in co-parenting and make arrangements in the best interests of their children: [18]. The AD also referred to <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (at [24]): Instead of litigating in the courts for the variation of orders, parents should endeavour to make adjustments by agreement to the care and access orders where necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is unfortunate that 7 years after their divorce was granted, these parties continue to be locked in acrimonious litigation over issues pertaining to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Dismissal of Prayer 6 of FC/SUM 3216/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order in terms of prayer 6 of FC/SUM 3397/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">4 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The issue pertained to with whom the children were to be with on 4 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The mother sought an order that she should be entitled to make up access on 4 October 2024 whilst the father sought an order giving effect to an express agreement between the parties with regard to an equal split of school holiday for the period 30 August to 7 September 2024. Resulting from this agreement, the children were to be with the mother on 4 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As set out, according to the mother, the parties agreed to a split of the children’s school holiday for the period 30 August to 7 September 2024. On 26 August 2024, the mother said that she spotted an alleged erroneous calculation of that school holiday period but as parties had made their respective plans with the children for their share of that period, she proceeded with the agreement. However, because of the erroneous split, she said that the alternating entitlements of the parties shifted with the result that the school holiday after the term break fell to the father and the next one (4 October 2024) to the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The make-up time with the children she sought therefore pertained to what the mother said stemmed from the erroneous calculation of that school holiday period. As a result of this alleged erroneous calculation by the father, the mother took the view that she had been disadvantaged. She offered to keep the arrangements the parties had agreed to but sought another 1.5 days with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The husband’s position was straightforward. There was no reason to grant the order sought by the wife as the children were in fact with her on that day. This was pursuant to an express written agreement detailing how the parties were to share the time with the children. The husband said that the agreement was set out in an exchange of emails on 1 October 2024 exhibited in the husband’s affidavit filed on 25 October 2024 at pages 32 to 33.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     My decision was likewise straightforward – it was predicated on the parties’ written agreement. Notwithstanding calculations and division of days, parties are always at liberty to agree between themselves on the sharing of time with the children. I refer to paragraph 11 above. In line with co-parenting and considering the children’s needs and welfare, the parties reached an agreement. The agreement was not disputed. The mother herself said she would comply with the agreement as arrangements had been made for the children. She proceeded with her share of that school holiday period in accordance with the agreement. The time sharing of the children for that school holiday period was spent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having reached such an agreement and acting in accordance with the agreement, the mother then raised an issue with an alleged erroneous calculation. She sought to impose “penalties” on the father by claiming an extra 1.5 days with the children. When she filed the summons, it became a replacement of one day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although she did have the children with her on 4 October 2024, the mother sought a replacement one day “in lieu of her entitlement to the children for a one-off school holiday on 4 October 2024”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     From what I can surmise, the mother’s disgruntlement stemmed from the definition of school holidays and the application to that particular school holiday period. For completeness, this definition (of school holidays) was dealt with by the High Court in its decision of 11 March 2021 in which the Court defined school holidays for the parties as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[83] The Husband has asked that school holidays be defined, and the Wife has agreed to the draft definition in the AC. This draft was revised by the Husband in the Appellant's Speaking Notes ... to cover multi-day school holidays. I substitute para 16 of [the AM Orders] with the following, based on the revised draft:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">School holidays are to be equally shared between the parties. A school holiday shall, for the purposes of these Orders, be a non-teaching day as stated in the children’s school calendar (“the calendar”). In the case of a multi-day school holiday, the school holiday commences on the first non-teaching day of the holiday break as stated in the calendar and shall continue until the day before the first teaching day as stated in the calendar. In all cases, a school holiday shall run from 5:30pm on the eve of the day until 7:30pm on the day itself. ...&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     However, the point to be noted is not the definition of school holidays or whether there was an erroneous calculation <em>but</em> that parties had an agreement. They both acted on the said agreement; the school holiday period in question had lapsed and the mother had the children with her on 4 October 2024 in reliance on that agreement. Indeed, in the spirit of co-parenting, the parties have been enjoined repeatedly to agree on time sharing with their children as they are best placed to determine this. Having done so, the mother should not press on to claim a disadvantage of a loss of one day with the children with whom she has care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The mother is also not a naïve litigant in person. She is legally trained and has fired many salvos herself in the litigation arena with applications for time sharing, clarification of time sharing and the filing of many affidavits. Having agreed with the father on the holiday period in question, she should not now be permitted to backtrack and claim an additional day. There was no basis for this Court to grant the relief sought in prayer 6 of the mother's Summons and this prayer was accordingly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order in terms of prayer 7 of FC/SUM 3397/2024 – make up access to the father</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">31 August and 1 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The children had a mid-term break in the week of 2 to 6 September 2024. On Friday 30 August, the children did not have to attend school because it was Children's Day. 31 August was a Saturday, and this was the father’s time with the children pursuant to the AM Orders. 1 September was a Sunday and Father’s Day and meant for the father to spend time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The parties had agreed that 30 August 2024 was a single-day school holiday and that this day was meant for the father. Father’s Day was also meant for the father. This then led to the multi-day school holiday in the week of 2 to 6 September which would include the weekend of 7 and 8 September. The parties agreed to the calculation of 7 days (2 to 8 September 2024) and the mother agreed to take the first half as this was again, an equal split. This was set out in emails in pages 35 to 36 of the father’s affidavit filed on 25 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     However, 3 days before handover to the father, the mother claimed that Children’s Day on 30 August 2024 also formed part of the multi-day school holiday starting on 2 September 2024. This led to emails being sent as referred to in pages 23 to 32 of the mother’s affidavit of 8 October 2024. The mother was only prepared to let the father have the children from Tuesday 3 September 2024. This was notwithstanding that parties had reached an agreement on time sharing as set out in paragraph 26 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Because of the mother’s change in position, again departing from an agreement at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, the father did not see the children on 30 August 2024 (his entitlement pursuant to the definition of a single-day school holiday), Saturday which was part of his weekend access order pursuant to the AM orders and more pertinently, on Father’s Day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The parties had agreed to the arrangement with the school holidays to be divided between them from 2 to 8 September 2024. Because the mother resiled on the agreement and retained the children with her depriving the father of his single-day school holiday, his Saturday access and Father’s Day, the father was therefore entitled to the make-up access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The parties subsequently agreed to a replacement and swapped single-day school holiday which resolved the issue of replacement time for the father on 30 August 2024. The father was therefore entitled to the make-up access for his loss of access on 31 August 2024 and 1 September 2024 and I so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Whilst the High Court had defined single-day school holidays and multi-school holidays (see paragraph 11 above), the parties have managed to agree and rework time sharing of their children considering the children’s needs and welfare as well as the parties’ own schedules. It is important for the parties to agree and resolve this time sharing of their children without the Court’s intervention; they are, after all, the children’s parents. It is also not right to agree on an arrangement and then throw it out on the 11<sup>th</sup> hour then insisting on “rights” and “claims”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The parties would do well to move away from their perceived entitled positions and think in terms of what would work best for the children with the least movement for handovers. At the crux of this matter, the issues are not legal issues. These are parenting matters, and it is unfortunate that their inability to co-parent spawned an appeal for 3 dates of access/make-up time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I have said before that these parties would benefit from the assistance of a parenting coordinator or a mediator as they are wasting precious time in drafting affidavits and filing applications ironically about time sharing with the children; time which would have been better spent with their children. I hope for the children’s sake that the parties would heed the advice of the Court as set out in paragraph 8.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Division of matrimonial assets","Family law – Custody – Access to Children","Family law – Child – Maintenance of Child"],"date":"2025-02-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 5338 of 2022","title":"WZH v WZI","citation":"[2025] SGFC 15","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32931-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Alain Abraham Johns and Ms Emira Binte Abdul Razakjr (Alain A Johns Partnership) for the Plaintiff","Mr Muhammad Hasif Bin Abdul Aziz (A.W.

The Plaintiff-Husband (“Husband”) and the Defendant-Wife (“Wife”) registered their marriage on 25 September 2018 and, although the parties were blessed with two children in their time together, the Husband filed for divorce on 17 November 2022 (shortly after the Wife’s departure from their matrimonial home a month earlier).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was eventually granted on 13 December 2023. Thereafter, the parties spent the following year preparing for the eventual ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing which came before me in November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the AM hearing, both parties’ counsel confirmed the following to the Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties have since agreed that both parents should share joint custody of the children of the marriage, [K] (5 years old) and [R] (3 years old) (collectively referred to as, the “Children”), with the Wife having sole care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife was not seeking any maintenance post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The remaining AM issues (<em>ie.</em> the division of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), the maintenance payable for the Children, as well as the Husband’s access arrangements) were disputed. However, counsel acknowledged that the parties’ disagreement on the issue of access were not significant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After hearing parties, I provided my brief grounds of decision to the parties via a Registrar’s Notice sent pursuant to r. 670(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I now set out below my full grounds of decision on the contested AM issues below, starting with the issue of the Children’s access arrangement (given the parties’ broad agreement on the matter).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Access to the Children of the Marriage</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As stated above, both parties agreed that the Wife should be granted care and control of the Children. Accordingly, it was also not disputed that the Husband should be allowed access to the Children. The question, however, was what the terms of the access order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       What was somewhat unusual in the present case was the Wife’s request for the Court to make orders which were, in some situations, <em>more generous</em> than what the Husband had asked for. The Court was therefore asked to decide whether it was reasonable for the Husband to be given <em>less</em> access than what was being offered by the Wife. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife asked this Court to order that the Husband be given <em>weekly</em> unsupervised overnight access from Sunday to Monday. In addition, she also asked that the Husband be given access to the Children during every public holiday, and that the Husband take overnight access on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year (“CNY”) public holiday to the 2<sup>nd</sup> day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     However, it was the Husband’s position, in his written submissions, that he only wanted access every Sunday (with no overnight stay), and that he be given overnight access <em>once a month</em> from Saturday morning to Sunday evening. He also only sought access on <em>alternate</em> public holidays, and from the CNY eve to CNY Day 1 during the CNY festive period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That said, during the AM hearing, the Husband’s counsel confirmed that the Husband was prepared to accept what the Wife had proposed with regard to public holiday and CNY access. As such, I made the relevant orders accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     What remained disputed were the weekly unsupervised access arrangements, and various additional orders relating to <em>inter alia</em> overseas access and the Children’s place of residence (the latter of which I shall come to, below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the outset, I wish to point out that if the Wife’s proposals were indeed borne out of her hope that the Husband spends more time with the Children – as she had claimed in her submissions – this was indicative of a positive mindset towards effective co-parenting and should be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The importance of such an approach and mindset, which in some cases means helping <em>the other parent</em> to be stronger, was highlighted by the High Court (Family Division) in <em>VXM v VXN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26996-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 42</a> (at [53]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[i]f it is in the welfare of the children to require parents to be cooperative with the other parent, to extend grace, and even to help the other parent to be a stronger parent if needed, then these <em>needs of the children prevail over</em> the personal needs of the individual parents.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Nevertheless, the Court would be alive to the fact that while an access parent should be given ample opportunity to build a stronger bond with his or her children, the orders themselves must cater to the children’s readiness <em>and</em> to the access parent’s ability to meet the terms of the orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After all, orders requiring an access parent to be available or present during specific timeframes and/or extended periods themselves impose a positive obligation on that parent to meet and follow the terms of such orders. Such orders – if overly extensive – may sometimes create discord between the parties, or even disappointment on the part of the children, if the access parent refuses or is otherwise unable to comply with the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It is therefore important for the Court to undertake a holistic assessment as to what orders would ultimately be in the Children’s “welfare” and best interests: see s 125(2), WC. This involves a multi-faceted and multi-factorial analysis, and which should be understood in its widest sense (see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/49688-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 135</a>). In my view, such an analysis may sometimes include <em>inter alia</em> the access parent’s personal wishes and his or her ability to meet the terms of any orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having considered the matter, I decided not to make all the orders sought by the Wife, as I do not find them to be in the Children’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Instead, I broadly agree with the Husband’s proposed orders (including those orders sought by the Wife which he was prepared to accept) which I found to be appropriate in the circumstances. I therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Subject to (b) below, the Husband shall have unsupervised access to the Children, every week from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall have unsupervised overnight access to the Children on the last Saturday of every month from 10.30 am on Saturday to Sunday 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With effect from the date of this Order, the Husband shall have access to the Children on every Public Holidays (excluding the CNY holidays) from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     During CNY public holiday period, the Husband shall have access on CNY Day 1 from 10.30 am to the CNY Day 2 at 10.30 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Subject to any agreement between the parties, the Husband shall pick up the Children from their place of residence at the beginning of access, and shall return them on or before the end of the access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Wife is to take all necessary steps to facilitate the aforesaid access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now address the three (3) remaining disputed issues between the parties. These relate to <em>overseas</em> access, video-call access and the disclosure of the Children’s residential address.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     To begin with, I found it bizarre that the question of overseas access was raised by the Wife in her submissions when the Husband was clear that he was <em>not</em> seeking any orders for overseas access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Husband recognised that overseas access was an issue which both parties may have to revisit when the Children are ready to go overseas with him. The Husband’s position was that this should be a matter which both parents can discuss and resolve amongst themselves later on.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife, on the other hand, asked that the Court make a positive order forbidding the Husband from taking the Children for overseas access until the parties’ younger child turns 13 years old. For context, their younger child, [R], was only 3 years old (in 2024). Such an order meant that I would be effectively granting a 10-year injunction against the Husband from travelling overseas with the Children even though: (i) no order for overseas travel had even been sought by the Husband; and (ii) neither the Wife nor her counsel could provide any clear or cogent reasons why I should make such a prospective order, and for the number of years sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Having considered the matter, I decided not to make any orders relating to overseas access. Any such order would be entirely speculative (at the present juncture) and not grounded on any legitimate basis. Should the need arise, the question of overseas access should be dealt with separately and/or in subsequent proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nevertheless, I strongly encourage the Wife – given what I had mentioned above about the need to be a bigger, stronger and wiser parent – to approach this issue with the same mindset she had adopted on the issue of Husband’s weekly and public holiday access. Children thrive when their parents act as role models and demonstrate to them that disputes and differences can be resolved through calm discussion and mutual understanding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I next deal with the issue of the Husband’s video call access. The Wife’s written submissions did not address this issue directly although she did refer to an existing consent order <em>vis-à-vis</em> interim care and control and access (<em>vide.</em> FC/ORC xxx/2023) where there was provision for weekly video call access. The Husband’s position was that the existing video-call access arrangement should remain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I was of the view that video-call access, which were already part of the existing <em>consent</em> order between the parties, should continue since there was no good reason put forth by either party to change this arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For good order, as orders made in the AM proceedings were a form of <em>final</em> relief, I made the same video-call access orders (as part of my overall AM orders) so that it was clear between the parties that FC/ORC xxx/2023 has since been superseded by my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The final issue between the parties relate to whether the Wife should be made to disclose to the Husband, the Children’s residential address.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the Husband’s counsel had highlighted at the AM hearing, the Wife had steadfastly refused to disclose the Children’s and her residential address, even going as far as redacting all such reference and information in the documents she had filed in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my view, it was ancillary to, and consequential upon, the custody and access orders which were made <em>vis-a-vis</em> the Children for the Husband to also be provided with such information. I therefore agreed with the Husband that the Wife should be made to inform him of the Children’s residential address. To avoid doubt, the Court is empowered to impose such conditions as it may think fit to impose when making an order for the custody or care and control of the Children: see ss 126(1) and (2A), WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Being a joint custodial parent, I find that it was reasonable for the Husband to know where the Children live, in the event that he has to make any custodial decision and/or in the case of health emergencies. He would also need to know where he should pick up or return the Children for access. Neither party provided any evidence to suggest that the Husband was (or continues to be) a threat or danger to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In this regard, the Wife did advance some allegations regarding her personal safety. However, such concerns (if at all) relate to her <em>personal</em> safety and not the <em>Children’s</em>. In any case, these would already have been addressed by the personal protection order she had obtained against the Husband in separate proceedings. I see no reason for these concerns to justify withholding the Children’s place of residence from the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I now move on to the address the major dispute between the parties, <em>viz.</em> the just and equitable division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial pool of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I start by addressing the assets within the parties’ matrimonial pool (“Matrimonial Pool”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In the present case, both parties had filed their respective Fact and Position Sheets setting out each party’s position on what fell within the Matrimonial Pool, prior to the AM hearing. The Wife’s counsel was also subsequently granted leave to file a revised version to account for some discrepancies which was highlighted during the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     With regard to their matrimonial home, both counsel confirmed that the parties’ property at Ghim Moh Road (“Matrimonial Flat”) fell within the Matrimonial Pool and should be valued at the agreed figure of $435,000. After taking into account the outstanding mortgage loan, the net value of the Matrimonial Flat would be approximately $204,677.50 (<em>ie.</em> adopting the Husband’s calculations for the outstanding mortgage amount).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As regards the Wife’s assets (save for the issue of dissipation which I will address below), I make the following broad findings and/or observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties were largely in agreement <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Wife’s cash (or cash-equivalent) assets held in her sole name. Although there were some discrepancies and differences in the original Fact and Position Sheet filed by the Wife, her revised version broadly aligned with what the Husband had stated in his own Fact and Position Sheet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In total, I found the Wife to be holding assets amounting to approximately $528,970.38 (excluding the value of her motor vehicle, her branded handbag, and her cryptocurrency). For completeness, it was not disputed that the Wife had used the monies in her Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) account to purchase a “GRO Saver Flex” policy. During the AM hearing, the Husband – through his counsel – accepted the Wife’s valuation figure of $12,254.24 for this asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to the Wife’s car, the parties disagreed as to the value which should be ascribed to this asset. The Wife submitted that the value of car was only $19,926.78, while the Husband submitted that the car’s <em>purchase</em> value (<em>ie.</em> $56,273.62) should be used instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I agreed with the Husband that the car’s purchase value (and not its estimated present value) should be used. It was not disputed that the car in question was purchased <em>after</em> the commencement of the present divorce proceedings, but before IJ was granted. The Husband did not consent to this expenditure and to the Wife’s use of matrimonial funds to acquire this asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In my view, this situation fell squarely within the ambit of what is referred to as the “<em>TNL dicta”</em> (drawn from the Court of Appeal’s seminal decision in <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31659-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 437</a> (“<em>WOS</em>”), the Appellate Division of the High Court explained that the <em>TNL dicta</em> recognises that “<em>substantial sums expended during the period where divorce proceedings are imminent must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse has at least a putative interest in it and has not consented, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time</em>”: see <em>WOS</em> at [43].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_g\"></a>(g)     As such, the monies expended by the Wife in acquiring her car should be accounted for. If the Wife had used some $56,273.62 to acquire what she now values at less than $20,000, then this “loss” was one which the Husband should not be responsible for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_h\"></a>(h)     With regard to the Wife’s branded handbag, there was some dispute between the parties as to its value. The difference is comparatively minor – the Husband valued it at $1,500 more than the Wife. Unfortunately, I was not persuaded by the Husband’s evidence of value (which comprised internet printouts/articles regarding the value of branded ladies’ handbags<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>) which did not relate to the <em>actual</em> value of the Wife’s bag and, more importantly, did not account for its condition and re-sale value. As the Husband did not discharge his burden of proof, I adopted the Wife’s valuation of $3,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I now turn to the Wife’s cryptocurrency assets. This was a significant dispute given the <em>amount</em> involved, <em>ie.</em> $176,898.88 (being the value ascribed by the Husband) as compared to $72,947 (based on the Wife’s own declaration). As with the Wife’s car, I found it relevant to apply the <em>TNL dicta</em> to resolve this dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To put matters in context, the Wife had liquidated approximately $103,000 worth of the parties’ cryptocurrency on the pretext that she had to use the same to pay for her and the family’s expenses. The Wife sought to provide <em>reasons</em> for her use of these funds because the principle underlying the <em>TNL dicta</em> allows for “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses used for the family to be exempted from its application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Yet, as the Wife’s counsel rightly conceded during the AM hearing, the monies which the Wife was shown to have used to pay her solicitors, and her mother could not be reasonably be said to constitute “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses which are exempted from the application of the <em>TNL dicta</em>. These transactions alone accounted for approximately 60% of the significant payments and/or withdrawals she had made from monies she received in 2023 from liquidating the cryptocurrency assets. The remaining withdrawals were payments to herself, or for her credit card expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Overall, I found it appropriate to return to the Matrimonial Pool the sum of $76,050, being $103,000 (which was the amount received by the Wife from the liquidation of the relevant cryptocurrencies) less $22,050 (being $2,450 x 9 months). I have allowed for the deduction of $22,050 as recognition of the household and/or the Children’s expenses which the Wife had to bear during the relevant period using the liquidated funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I note that at [17] of District Judge Darryl Soh’s (“DJ Soh”) Oral Grounds of Judgment (“DJ Soh’s Judgment”) in FC/SUM 1827/2023 (<em>ie.</em> the Wife’s earlier interim maintenance application), DJ Soh had declined to make an order for backdated maintenance in view of the fact that the Wife had “<em>access to and used matrimonial funds to pay for her and the Children’s expenses</em>”. I therefore accept that part of proceeds from the sale of the cryptocurrencies went to sustain the family’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The figure of $2,450 I had used was consistent with the maintenance amount which DJ Soh had ordered in FC/SUM 1827/2023 (“Interim Maintenance Order”). I found this amount to be a reasonable proxy of what would have been “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” family expenses during the relevant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Accordingly, I valued the Wife’s total sole named assets to be <u>$664,294.</u> This figure included her CPF monies, car, other cash assets, as well as the amount returned to the Matrimonial Pool arising from her liquidation of the cryptocurrency assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I now move on to the Husband’s sole named assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The parties were largely <em>ad idem</em> on most of the Husband’s assets,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> save for one significant item – the alleged dissipation of assets by the Husband. In the Wife’s revised written submissions, she submitted that I should “add-back” a total of $706,455<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> to the Matrimonial Pool because the Husband had dissipated this amount through allegedly clandestine or suspicious transfers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having carefully considered the evidence presented, I agreed with the Wife that some of the bank transactions entered into by the Husband were not “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” and should be returned to the Matrimonial Pool pursuant to the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Although not strictly necessary, I also accept the Wife’s submission that some of the Husband’s other transactions/payments were not properly explained and there was a strong suggestion that the Husband had attempted to conceal assets from her and the Court. In my view, an adverse inference can also be drawn against the Husband in respect of these transactions with the same effect that these assets should be notionally “added back” to the Matrimonial Pool for the purpose of the AM proceedings. I shall explain my findings, below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     First, I wish to make clear what <em>I did not</em> find to be suspicious transactions and/or transactions falling within the ambit of the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Contrary to the Wife’s submissions, I did not find the Husband’s withdrawals (of up to $1,000) from his OCBC and POSB bank accounts to be an attempt to dissipate assets, nor were they significant transactions falling within the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I accept the Husband’s submission that these were used to pay for his personal expenses, or as allowance to his parents (out of filial piety). In reaching this conclusion, I took into account the Husband’s earning capacity, and the lifestyle he was maintaining (and was entitled to maintain) at the material time. Likewise, I do not find the payment of $1,565 to one [S] (his accountant) to be inappropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, the Wife’s claim in this regard appeared to be based on her subjective belief as to what were the Husband’s attempts to dissipate assets. As the Husband’s counsel pointed out during the AM hearing, the Wife herself could have been said to be similarly “dissipating” assets since she spent monies of similar amounts. I found the Wife’s approach – which was primarily based on what she believed to be “large” transactions undertaken by the Husband post-divorce proceedings – to be too speculative. Moreover, I agreed with the Husband’s submission that some of the transactions identified by the Wife were, in fact, transactions <em>between</em> the Husband’s own bank accounts (for eg. the transaction said to have occurred in January and March 2023)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> – this reflected the speculative (and, possibly, over-inclusive) nature of the Wife’s approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also did not agree with the Wife that the transaction involving $19,900 in November 2022 was an act of dissipation, or an instance of profligate spending. I accepted the Husband’s explanation that this was a payment for stamp duty to the tax authorities. In my view, this is supported by his bank transaction record showing payment to the commissioner for stamp duties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The only item which I found to be within the scope of the <em>TNL dicta</em> was the Husband’s withdrawal and subsequent payment of $10,000 his mother. The Husband argued that this was meant to fund his mother’s medical expenses, but I agreed with the Wife’s submission that he had not discharged his burden to explain the said expense.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> No documentary proof was adduced to support his explanation. This amount ought to be “added-back” to the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I now move on to a key aspect of the Wife’s case, <em>viz.</em> the significant monies the Husband had transferred to one [RK] in 2022 and 2023. In total, the Husband had transferred $420,000 to [RK] (out of the alleged amount $706,445 which the Wife claimed had been dissipated).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband did not dispute that the monies were indeed transferred to [RK]. However, his position was that these were legitimate transactions paid pursuant to contractual agreements between [RK] and him. To support his claim, he exhibited 2 “business agreements” he had signed with [RK] on two dates – <em>ie.</em> 1 November 2022 and 1 November 2023 (collectively, the “BAs”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife strenuously disputed the propriety and reliability of these 2 BAs. To buttress her arguments, the Wife pointed to the unusual timings of these contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     With regard to the 2022 BA, the Wife highlighted that the relevant $180,000 transfer to [RK] occurred on 8 December 2022, shortly after the Husband had liquidated certain time deposits from one of his investment products.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As regards the 2023 BA, a sum of $240,000 was transferred to RK two (2) days after the Husband had received the surrender monies for his SingLife policy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Having reviewed the evidence provided, I agreed with the Wife that the nature and circumstances surrounding the creation and/or execution of the 2 BAs to be highly suspect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Putting aside the apparent visual similarity between the 2 documents (which, as the Wife had pointed out, were identical in form using the same fonts and linguistic style), the BAs themselves were <em>digital</em> documents (in the sense that the BAs were stored in an electronic form, with the signatures appended electronically) containing almost identical clauses and terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The two BAs even contained the same errors and/or surplusage in language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For eg. the preamble of the 2022 BA, somewhat oddly, states that the “Client” (<em>ie.</em> the Husband) wanting to obtain [RK]’s “<em>professional attributions</em>” without any clear explanation of what “attributions” means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Both BAs erroneously defined a period of time (eg. the period from November 2022 to October 2023) as the “<em>Effective Date</em>”, when a period of time is clearly not a “date” <em>per se</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In any event, the phrase “<em>Effective Date</em>” is never used anywhere else in either contract thus rendering the use of a defined term entirely meaningless and superfluous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     While these visual and linguistic peculiarities, in and of themselves, do not automatically imply that the BAs were unenforceable or a sham, they operate as indicators suggesting that the BAs were, in fact, not the product of detailed negotiations nor were they prepared as part of an arms’ length deal. These features took on some importance given the significant <em>monetary value</em> involved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     What was more concerning was the <em>complete</em> lack of details and clarity in the legal terms and obligations arising from the BAs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     To begin with, the BAs were entirely silent on the <em>specific obligations</em> which each of the Husband and [RK] had actually taken on in these contracts. Other than the BAs stating – in its preamble – that the Husband wishes to obtain [RK]’s so-called “<em>professional attributions</em>” (whatever such a term meant in the 2022 BA) or “<em>professional services</em>” (in the 2023 BA), the contracts themselves say nothing as to how, when, and to whom such “attributions” or “services” were to be rendered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I should highlight that the description of the “services” to be rendered by [RK] were wholly vague – the terms used were, for eg. “<em>Administrative Support</em>”, “<em>Production Developments</em> and “<em>Life Coaching</em>”, none of which were defined or explained in either BA. The payment terms were similarly lacking in clarity and detail – it merely states a sum of money “<em>paid upfront for full 12 months contract</em>” without stating who was to pay what to whom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The <em>absence</em> of what would have been critical terms was equally telling. There was no express term on how and when [RK] was to provide his services, including whether he was entitled to any time off and/or whether he was meant to work for the Husband round the clock. There were no terms whatsoever on the issue of breach – nothing was said as to what would happen if [RK] had failed to provide the services sought, or if they were of a poor quality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     One would assume it would have been crucial for such terms to be included when parties negotiate a contract for services. Otherwise, the Husband appeared to be content to part ways with approximately a quarter of a million dollars “upfront” <em>without any recourse</em> should the counterparty later renege on his obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     This lack of clarity thus fortified the Wife’s allegation that it was highly unusual for the Husband to “increase” the contractual value by $60,000 (or a 30% increase from the 2022 BA’s contractual value) in the 2023 BA even though [RK] was providing the exact same work or served to the Husband. Why did the Husband decide to “pay” even more money to [RK] without any corresponding increase in any of [RK]’s obligations?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The above concerns neatly dovetailed with the <em>timing</em> of the BAs. I accept that the Wife’s point that so-called payments pursuant to the two BAs appeared too conveniently timed with when the Husband received funds through the liquidation of his other matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I also took note of the obvious <em>inconsistency</em> between the date of the transfers and the alleged payment terms of the BAs. As observed earlier, the BAs (which were sparsely drafted) contained only 1 payment-related term, <em>ie.</em> that the full contract sum was “<em>paid upfront for full 12 months contract</em>”. Yet, it was plain from the dates of the actual transfers that the contract sum was <em>not</em> in fact “paid upfront” as envisaged under the BAs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In respect of the 2022 BA, the payment to [RK] took place <em>more than 1 month</em> after the contract was purportedly signed on 1 November 2023. The Husband provided no evidence to show that he had negotiated with [RK] any separate payment arrangement or agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In other words, either the Husband was in breach of the 2022 BA the minute it was signed, or [RK] had agreed to perform work free of charge for more than a month without any expectation to be paid. Either way, I did not find these possibilities to be persuasive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Similarly, for the 2023 BA, payment to RK was not done “upfront”, and occurred only 1 week later. This was highly unusual given that by 2023, the parties presumably would have already been in a contractual relationship for close to one year, and knowing full well that the 2022 BA would be coming to an end by 31 October 2024. If parties were desirous to extend their contractual relationship, the Husband should have known when he would be in a position to pay [RK]. Yet, the parties chose to sign an agreement where payment was stated to have been done “upfront” even though no such payment would be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Although each of the aforesaid issues – when considered individually – may possibly be explained by the Husband’s and/or [RK]’s inattention to detail as laypersons or mere oversight, the overall picture suggests a complete lack of care and/or interest in the actual enforceability or legality of the BAs. The BAs appeared to have been hastily drafted by the Husband to explain, <em>ex post facto</em>, the monies he had transferred to [RK].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I therefore conclude that the BAs were created by the Husband with the intent of giving a veil of legitimacy for the transfers he had made to [RK]. In my view, the <em>true</em> purpose of the transfers was to conceal and/or hide what would have been matrimonial assets liable for division. There was sufficient evidence and basis to support the drawing of an adverse inference against the Husband: see <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [68].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In any event, regardless of the BAs’ legitimacy, I find that the payments to [RK] were made using matrimonial monies without the Wife’s consent, and do not constitute “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses. They were also not ordinary business expenses as it was not at all clear why [RK] were paid those amounts given the nature of the services to be provided by him, and the lack of clarity as to his precise scope of work. The 30% increment paid to [RK] in 2023 was also not supported by good reason or cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In the circumstances, I found that a sum of $430,000 (being $420,000 transferred to RK, and the $10,000 transferred to the Husband’s mother) should be notionally “returned” to the Matrimonial Pool, and be subject to division in the AM proceedings.</p> <p

Division: Appropriate Methodology &amp; Approach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Having addressed the contents and value of the Matrimonial Pool, I now move on to discuss the appropriate ratio of division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In her submissions, the Wife’s position was that neither the structured approach recognised in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ</em> approach”) nor the trends-based approach (<em>per TNL</em>) would be entirely suitable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> According to her, the parties’ marriage and her employment status were unique in that she was working <em>for the Husband</em> during the marriage and she believed that this may result in a skewed assessment of her matrimonial contributions (particularly, in considering her indirect contributions) if the <em>ANJ</em> approach was rigidly applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Nevertheless, the Wife – having regard to the High Court (Family Division)’s recent decision of <em>WUI v WUJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31716-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 25</a> – submitted that she was prepared to adopt the <em>ANJ</em> approach. The Husband’s submissions, on the other hand, proceeded on the assumption that the <em>ANJ</em> approach would be used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In my view, the Wife’s concerns appeared to stem from a misapprehension as to how the <em>ANJ</em> approach would be applied. I do not agree with her submissions on at least 2 aspects.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, one must have regard to why the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL</em> decided that for long single-income marriages, the <em>ANJ</em> approach was unsuitable. One key factor was the Court of Appeal’s concern that the <em>ANJ</em> approach may result in the over-valuing of the breadwinner spouse’s financial contributions and, at the same time, undervaluing the non-working spouse given that in the long single-income marriage paradigm, the non-working spouse tends to have little or nothing in the way of direct financial contributions (which was an integral part of the <em>ANJ</em> approach’s analytical framework).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such a concern would not strictly apply in short marriages, and, in any event, was not a concern at all <em>in the present case</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Second, I found the Wife’s concerns to be somewhat overstated. The <em>ANJ</em> approach was, in any case, sufficiently robust and could take into account the Wife’s direct and/or indirect contributions (even if, as the Wife claimed, her indirect contributions may not be so easily discernible or explained given her unusual employment situation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> itself explained the importance of the “broad brush approach” when considering the question of the spouses’ direct and indirect contributions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I am thus of the view that the <em>ANJ</em> approach should be adopted in the present case as the marriage was one involving dual-incomes, with both parties making direct and indirect contributions to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     To recapitulate, the <em>ANJ</em> approach requires the Court to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions having regard to the amount of direct financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets; (b) ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the wellbeing of the family throughout the marriage. Thereafter, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">(see <em>TOF v TOE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26792-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 2 SLR 976</a> at [63(b)])</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I will now explain how this approach should be applied in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Just and Equitable Division: Direct Financial Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     With respect to their respective direct financial contributions (“DFC”) to the marriage, the parties appear to largely agree on the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_a\"></a>(a)     their direct contributions towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the assets held by a party (and which has been found to be acquired by their own effort) would be used as a “proxy” for their direct contributions to the marriage; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_c\"></a>(c)     flowing from (b) above, the Husband’s sole-named assets represented his DFC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The parties’ main disagreements principally relate to whether the SingLife Policy (ending -304) and the cryptocurrency held by the Wife should be treated as her DFC, or should part of these assets be treated as representing the Husband’s contributions because he was the person who had paid for these assets (either in part or wholly).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In my view, the Husband had not shown sufficient evidence in support of his claim that the Wife’s declared SingLife Policy was jointly purchased with his money. While he sought to explain that the policy was purchased in January 2020 through a single lump-sum payment, that assertion alone does not necessarily mean that half of this amount should be attributed to him. I was not persuaded that the Husband had shown the Wife to be totally incapable of affording the premium for this policy at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     However, as regards the Wife’s cryptocurrency asset, I was of the view that <em>half</em> of the value of the said assets should be attributed to the Husband. This amount included the notional amount I had added-back to the Matrimonial Pool as set out at [42] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In this regard, the Wife had herself repeatedly asserted that the cryptocurrency was purchased with the parties’ joint monies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It would follow that she should recognise the Husband’s contribution to these assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Although the Husband argued that he was the one who had paid for all of the cryptocurrency assets to the tune of approximately $709,000,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I did not find this allegation to have been sufficiently proven. Most of the Husband’s arguments were premised on inferences which he drew from what the Wife had deposed in her other affidavits apropos her income at the material time, and her ability to purchase the said asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Insofar as the Husband sought to rely on the fact that the Wife’s income/earnings ultimately came from him to show that he was the one who had “paid” for the cryptocurrency (or any other asset acquired by the Wife), I rejected this argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     As mentioned above, the broad-brush approach remains relevant even in the context of the <em>ANJ</em> approach. I did not agree with the Husband that simply because the <em>source</em> of the Wife’s salary and/or income was the Husband’s business meant that <em>all</em> of her salary or income should be treated as if they were his contributions. In paying his Wife a salary (and declaring to the authorities as such), the Husband was clearly acting <em>qua</em> employer and not as her spouse. The monies received by the Wife, at the material time, represented her wages for work done and belonged to her both legally and beneficially.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Accordingly, in respect of the Wife’s cryptocurrency assets, I only attributed a sum of $74,498.50 (being $148,997 ÷ 2) to the Husband for the purpose of assessing his DFC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     For completeness, with regard to the issue of the parties’ contributions to the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat, although parties were broadly in agreement, I found it appropriate to use the parties’ total CPF-based payments (at or around the IJ date) to derive the relevant ratio to be applied to the Matrimonial Flat’s net value, <em>ie.</em> The use of the IJ date reflects the recognition that the parties’ contributions <em>to the marriage</em> would stop after IJ has been granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The ratio to be applied to the Matrimonial Flat’s net value would be 51 (Husband) : 49 (Wife), based on the amount of CPF monies that had used to fund the said purchase.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In summary, I set out the parties’ overall DFC ratio below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 2 – DFC Ratio</u></b> </div><p></p>

No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court. <b>In most homes, even in a home where both the spouses are working full time, in the absence of concrete evidence it is more likely than not that ordinarily the wife will be the party who renders greater indirect contributions</b> [...]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     I did not find the Husband to have provided concrete evidence in support of his claim that he made greater (or, at least similar) indirect contributions in the realm of homemaking, parenting, or husbandry, so as to displace my finding that the Wife had, more likely than not, rendered greater IDC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    I found the present marriage to be one where each spouse took on slightly different roles in the marriage, even though the Wife was working for the Husband.

In support thereof, the Husband cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> (“<em>ATE v ATD</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    While it is well-established that the court <em>can</em> apply different weightages in the appropriate case, it is nevertheless important to understand <em>why</em> a court would do so. <em>ATE v ATD</em> itself provides a useful example.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    In that case, the Court of Appeal was considering a case involving a relatively short marriage where, for most of the marriage, the parties were childless. When the parties’ only child was born, the parties separated shortly thereafter. The Court further found the husband in that case to be calculative and stingy <em>vis-à-vis</em> the wife (who was the more financially successful party). The parties kept their finances separately throughout the marriage, and the wife never depended on the husband. The parties also had the assistance of a domestic helper and the wife’s mother in caring for the child. Under those circumstances, the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to place greater weightage on the parties’ direct contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In its subsequent decision in <em>USB v USA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“<em>USB</em>”), the Court of Appeal had occasion to further opine on when a court should adjust the weightage placed on the spouses’ direct and indirect contributions. The Court of Appeal’s following observations (at [40] – [42] of its judgment) are particularly apposite:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">40    Generally, indirect contributions are less significant in short marriages, especially those without children. The court may take this into account by ascribing a higher weightage to direct contributions. In ATE v ATD and another appeal <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a>, this court assigned the parties’ direct contributions a higher weightage in a marriage lasting about five years. Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA held at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Given that the marriage was a short one, that both Husband and Wife were working, the manner in which both Husband and Wife conducted their lives during the marriage itself, and that there was a not inconsiderable amount of assistance on the domestic scene, the appropriate ratio between direct and indirect contributions ought to be 75% and 25% respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">41     <b>It should be reiterated that the court has a discretion to adjust the weightage of direct and indirect contributions in a short marriage – it is not compelled to arrive at an unequal weightage. There may well be good reasons for the court to retain equal weightage between direct and indirect contributions even in a short marriage, especially if there are children</b>. Apart from short marriages, we add the important caveat that adjusting the weightage of the direct and indirect contributions should be done as an exception. This is because of the features of a long marriage as recognised by this court (ANJ v ANK ([1] supra) at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… Indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages … The courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42    Where the court exercises its discretion to adjust the weightage, apart from in a short marriage, we are of the view that cogent reasons should be provided to explain the departure from the norm of equal weightage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>Bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The facts in the present case were markedly different from <em>ATE v ATD</em> in that the parties here have 2 children to the marriage – [K] was born in August 2019, about 1 year into the parties’ marriage, and [R] was born 2 years thereafter. Parties largely remained an intact family until late 2022, with both parties expending efforts to care for the Children (albeit with external assistance). As I had noted above, the parties took on different roles during the marriage, which each expending efforts in different areas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    I emphasise that the Court of Appeal’s clear guidance in <em>USB</em> that any adjustment of the weightage is a matter of discretion and that a court is <em>not compelled</em> to arrive at an unequal weightage just because marriage was short, especially when there are children (as is the case here). When a court does place unequal weightage on the parties’ contributions, there must be cogent reasons to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In arriving at the appropriate IDC ratio (at [96] above), I already took into account factors such as the length of the parties’ marriage and their respective roles in the raising the Children and the maintenance of the household. I also considered the fact that the Husband himself accepts that some of the “bonuses” which he had paid the Wife “<em>were either diverted back into the business or into investments</em>”, and monies were by “<em>channel</em>[ed] <em>back to</em> [him]” for such purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    I therefore saw no additional and/or separate reason why I should place unequal weightage on the direct and indirect contributions. Indeed, placing greater weightage on direct contributions alone (as suggested by the Husband) may create the additional effect of over-valuing the assets which are held by the Husband. I therefore maintained the norm and placed equal weightage on the parties’ DFC and IDC ratios.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Implementation and Apportionment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    Given my decision above, I set out below how the division of the Matrimonial Pool should be carried out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 5 – Apportionment of Assets</u></b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"30.8935920047031%\"><col width=\"23.9271017048795%\"><col width=\"22.5602586713698%\"><col width=\"22.6190476190476%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>ANJ</em> Final Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">58%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">42%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Party’s share/apportionment of the Matrimonial Pool</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,370,558.58</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$992,473.46</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total asset pool:</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$2,363,032.04</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Less</em> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Assets in parties’ sole name</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($1,494,060.52)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($664,294.02)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Including notional amounts added back into the Matrimonial Pool</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Amount due to Party</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($123,501.36)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$328,179.86</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Percentage of sale proceeds to be transferred if Matrimonial Flat is sold</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">100%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    My detailed orders are set out at [139] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    I now move on to the final area of contention, <em>ie.</em> the amount payable by the Husband as his share of the Children’s maintenance. The Wife had confirmed that she was not seeking maintenance for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    As stated above, the Interim Maintenance Order which was in force between the parties required the Husband to pay maintenance for the Children in the sum of $2,450 per month. It is trite that that being an order for interim maintenance, the obligations therein would come to an end once I make a final maintenance order as part of the AM proceedings: see <em>AXM v AXO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0705.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 705</a> at [20] (“<em>AXM</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Court’s power to order maintenance for the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    Although the law relating to maintenance is largely uncontroversial, for conceptual clarity, I find it necessary to address a point raised in the Wife’s written submissions, <em>ie.</em> her purported reliance on s 118 of the WC and the alleged “material change” which has occurred since the making of the Interim Maintenance Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    I start by highlighting that this Court’s power to make a final order for the Children’s maintenance stems from s 127 of the WC, which provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to order maintenance for children</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">127.—(1)    During the pendency of any matrimonial proceedings or when granting or at any time subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of his or her child in such manner as the court thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    In my view, the Wife’s reference to s 118 of the WC in her written submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> was erroneous for at least two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, s 118 does not actually apply in the present case because that provision addressed applications for the variation of <em>spousal</em> maintenance orders made under s 113 of the WC. Applications to vary a child maintenance order are governed by s 127, read with Parts 8 and 9 of the WC (in particular, s 72 of the WC).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This is not necessarily a distinction without a difference. As the Court of Appeal had noted in <em>AXM</em> (at [33]), the language of s 72 appears wider that s 118.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Second</em>, and more importantly for present purposes, regardless of whether one is referring to s 118 or s 72, it would not be correct to say that the AM court’s role is to consider whether Interim Maintenance Order ought to be “varied” as I am not bound to follow the Interim Maintenance and this Court is, strictly speaking, hearing the matter afresh: see <em>AXM</em> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_d\"></a>(d)     This means that whether the final maintenance order should be similar to (or different from) the Interim Maintenance Order does not depend solely on whether there has been “<em>misrepresentation or mistake of fact or whether there has been any material change in the circumstances</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Notwithstanding the above, it appeared from the parties’ submissions that they each sought to persuade me that the terms of the Interim Maintenance Order should not be replicated in its entirety in my final maintenance order because they each believe that circumstances have changed such that some (but not all) of the terms of Interim Maintenance Order should be adjusted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Insofar as the Wife’s case used the terms of the Interim Maintenance Order as a broad “starting point”, I agreed with that approach. In my view, the Interim Maintenance Order, which was made in late 2023 after a detailed assessment of the Children’s expenses where both parties presented the relevant evidence, remained highly relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    To avoid doubt, I have considered the Husband’s submissions (including his claims that the Wife had not provided evidence of certain expenses, and/or that there was alleged double counting or excessive claims). However, as the High Court (Family Division) had noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) (at [10] and [11] of the judgment), maintenance orders are often made with a view of providing a “budget” for the care parent to use to maintain the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case. While receipts are useful as an indication of the child’s accustomed standard of living, they are not necessarily conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are. It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drawing up what can be described as a ‘budget’, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category (see, for example, the table set out below at [13]). It was observed in UEB v UEC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (at [13]): [quote omitted]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    In applying this “budget” approach to quantify maintenance, two points are worthy of note. First, the budget instils accountability between the parties in their continuing roles as co-parents, serving as a baseline financial framework for the parties in respect of their expenses concerning the child. Second, considering the categories of expenses within a “budget framework” is consistent with the notion that deciding how best to provide for the child (which includes what exactly to spend on in providing for the child) is a parenting matter. Thus, the court will not be overly prescriptive in how these budgeted monies are specifically applied to various detailed items of expenses. In drawing up the appropriate budget, parties may disagree over decisions such as what to spend on for the child’s benefit, including what the child is to eat, what enrichment classes the child should attend, and even which lifestyle habits to cultivate in the child. These are fundamentally parenting decisions involving parents’ views and aspirations for their child which are personal and unique to each set of parents. A court of law is not the most appropriate forum to resolve such parenting matters. Instead, it is a fundamental part of the parties’ parental responsibility to attempt to resolve their differences and come to a compromise for the child’s best interests. Even after a marriage has broken down, the mutual “give and take” which is the very pith and marrow of family decision-making should not cease […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    I found the Family Court’s earlier assessment that the Children’s monthly expenses amounted $9,083 (inclusive of their share of the household expenses) to be based on a reasonable and appropriate budget, having regard to the Children’s standard of living and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Changes since the Interim Maintenance Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    I now address the changes which each party has asked for in their respective AM submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    On the Wife’s part, she sought an <em>additional</em> order that the Husband be responsible for paying her for the Children’s <em>share</em> of the monthly rent she is paying for her current rented apartment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This category of expense was expressly excluded in DJ Soh’s decision as the Wife was staying with her parents when the Interim Maintenance Order was made, and there was no clear evidence that her parents had demanded rent from her (even though she claimed to be paying such “rent”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    The Wife explained that she had since taken on a lease for the sum of $3,500 per month, and therefore asked that the Husband to contribute thereto. The Husband disagreed on the basis that he had never agreed to the Wife taking on this lease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    As I had mentioned above, the law relating to maintenance is fairly trite and one established principle is that the obligation to provide maintenance for one’s children includes the provision of reasonable accommodation expenses, especially in circumstances where it was not unreasonable for the care parent and the children to live in their own apartment, separately from the other parent after the breakdown of the marriage: see <em>VXM v VXN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27669-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1174</a> at [17] and [19], <em>per</em> Debbie Ong J (as Her Honour then was).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    I thus found the Wife’s claim for a contribution towards the <em>Children’s share</em> of her $3,500 monthly rental expense to be reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    That said, given what she would receive from the division of the parties’ matrimonial asset (in view of my decision above), I would expect that she should take steps to acquire her own property in the long term, and she cannot assume that the Husband should be providing for this expense in perpetuity. After all, she had wanted care and control of the Children, and having been granted the same, she should take steps to procure permanent long-term accommodations for them. It was also the Wife’s position in her AM Fact and Position Sheet that she is seeking an order for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat in the open market.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    Any future changes in this respect may be addressed either by parties through mutual agreement, or by a variation of the order (if a change is justified).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    On the Husband’s part, his submissions were centred on persuading the Court that his personal financial circumstances have changed such that the approx. 83 (Husband) : 27 (Wife) apportionment ratio used by DJ Soh was no longer be appropriate since his earnings have decreased while the Wife’s income has increased since the time of the Interim Maintenance Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> He sought changes to the terms of Interim Maintenance Order on that basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Apportionment of the Children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    The use of the parties’ earnings and income as the basis for apportioning the Children’s expenses between the two parents is similarly well-established: see for eg., <em>WBU</em> at [40] – [43]. In determining the same, the Court undertakes a holistic assessment of the parties’ financial abilities, earning capacity and resources consistent with s 69(4) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    In the present case, I accept that the Wife’s income had increased from when the Interim Maintenance Order was made. By her own admission, she now earns approximately $10,000 each month. This is twice the amount which DJ Soh had assessed her income to be in November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    As regards the Husband’s earnings, his claim that his earnings had reduced appeared to be based principally on his latest income tax assessment wherein he reported an annual income of $106,117 (or approximately $8,800 per month).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    However, I agreed with the Wife that the Court’s assessment was not limited to one party’s <em>current</em> asserted income. The party’s overall <em>earning capacity</em> (which can be seen from taking a longitudinal view of his/her income over the years) was also relevant. In the Husband’s case, his current income reflected an unusual and drastic decrease from his previous years’ income, which, at its peak (in 2020), amounted to some $698,970 per year.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    Even when he filed his first AM affidavit in February 2024, he declared his income to be $25,000 per month. Considering the Husband’s historical earnings, I found the figure of $25,000 (which DJ Soh had used as a proximate for the Husband’s earning capacity) to remain fair and reasonable, even if the Husband’s declared income in his latest income tax documents was lower. In making this assessment, I considered the fact that the Husband ran his own business as well as my observations (at [68] – [70] above) <em>apropos</em> the Husband’s attempts and ability to hide/put aside assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    Accordingly, the apportionment ratio should be adjusted to 70 (Husband): 30 (Wife). This change in apportionment ratio would consequently mean that the Husband’s share of the Children’s expenses would be changed to approx. $6,360. Since he was currently paying for the Children’s school fees and insurance premiums in the sum of approx. $5,240 and should continue to do so, he should be responsible for the shortfall amount of <u>$1,120</u> per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    In addition, the Husband shall pay to the Wife the sum of $1,633, ie. 70% of $2,333 (being the Children’s share of the monthly rent).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    In the premises, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em><u>For the Children’s issues</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In relation to the Children’s issues, I granted (by consent) the parties joint custody of the children of the marriage, [K] and [R], with care and control of the Children granted to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I granted the Husband unsupervised weekly access from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm on Sundays, except that on the last Saturday of every month, he can have overnight access to the Children from 10.30 am on Saturday to Sunday 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I also granted the Husband: (i) access to the Children on every public holiday and during the CNY period as proposed by the Wife; and (ii) video-call access 3 days each week. Consequential orders were made relating to the pick-up and return of the Children, as well as requiring the Wife to provide to the Husband the address of the Children’s place of residence (including any change thereof, if and when there is such a change).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Division of Matrimonial Assets</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_d\"></a>(d)     With regard to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, I ordered that the Wife be entitled to the sum of $328,179.86 (being her share of the parties’ matrimonial assets) and made provision for how this order was to be implemented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In essence, I gave the Husband the option of acquiring the Wife’s share in the Matrimonial Flat by paying her the aforesaid sum of money. If he chose not to do so, then the Matrimonial Flat would be sold and the net sale proceeds would be used to pay off what the Wife was entitled to (with the Husband making good any shortfall in cash).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Save as set out above, I ordered that each party shall retain the assets in their sole name and possession. I also gave both parties liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    When I delivered my decision to the parties via Registrar’s Notice, I invited both counsel to provide submissions on the issue of costs (if any) for the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    Having considered the matter, and in light of the fact that neither party could be said to have been wholly successful in these proceedings, I made no order as to costs.

She had made this decision because of her age (she is about 81 years old)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and her health condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband’s mother had expressly stated on affidavit that she is prepared for me to make a fair and just decision in the proceedings between the Husband and the Wife. According to the mother, she had submitted in evidence all the relevant documents in her possession to prove that all the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Power to make factual findings v Power to make binding orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In deciding how to proceed in this matter, I found the following guidance from <em>UDA</em> to be instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If a court is notified of a third party’s claim to an alleged matrimonial asset but no separate legal action has been commenced, then the options available to the court will depend on the legal ownership of the property and whether the spouses seek a binding order over the property or the third party: <em>UDA</em> at [53] and [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the property is legally owned by one of the spouses who claims to hold it on trust for the third party, the court can determine whether the property is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party at all if no order is sought by or against the third party directly: <em>UDA</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     However, if an order binding the third party is sought, then a separate set of proceedings will have to be issued: <em>UDA</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Based on the above, I can determine whether the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to the Husband’s mother entirely – so long as I do not make binding orders against her. If the Wife wishes to seek such orders, then she will have to commence separate proceedings against the Husband’s mother. Presumably, the Wife will only do so if I find that the relevant funds belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In determining to whom do the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to, I took the following approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on first principles, as a joint account holder, the Husband has a legal (and by inference, a beneficial) interest of the funds in the Joint Accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the absence of evidence to the contrary, funds in a joint account belong to the account holders in equal proportions: <em>Timing Ltd v Tay Toh Hin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26460-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 1040</a> at [18]; <em>WWM v WWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> at [14]. In other words, the Husband is presumed to be the beneficial owner of half the funds in the Joint Accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the above, the burden of proof is thus as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband has the burden to prove <em>his case</em> that all the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to his mother and not to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Wife has the burden to prove <em>her case</em> that the Husband’s mother has no beneficial interest in the relevant funds whatsoever, and that they belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, the Wife has the burden to prove <em>her case</em> that the Husband had dissipated the relevant funds from the Joint Accounts to avoid their division in the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Applying the above principles, I find that the Joint Accounts are not matrimonial assets and are thus not liable for division. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">POSB 027 XXX</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that the Husband has rebutted the inference that he has beneficial interests in the funds in POSB 027 XXX. I come to this finding based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is not disputed that his mother had opened the account. According to the mother, the Husband did not contribute any fund in the account. The mother’s evidence is supported by the evidence. The bank records for POSB 027 XXX show that the account had (i) $54,750 on 27 May 1994<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and (ii) $75,436.23 on 31 December 1999.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> At the material times, the Husband was only 16 years old (1994) and 21 years old (1999). Furthermore, between 27 May 1994 to 1999, there were several deposits into, and withdrawals of funds from, the account. The largest of these involved $35,000. Given his young age and the amount of funds involved, it is unlikely that the Husband would not been the one who had conducted such transactions at the material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the mother gave evidence that she had no intention to gift to the Husband the funds in the account during her lifetime, and that he would be entitled to them only upon her death.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I have no reason to disbelieve this evidence. The mother is elderly and there is no evidence that she has any source of income. In the circumstances, there is no reason why she would want to gift to the Husband significant amount of funds in the account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Additionally, the Wife’s claim – that all the funds in POSB 027 XXX belong to the Husband – is based on her submission that “there is no evidence to show that the monies belong to the Husband’s Mother”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> With respect, this claim ignores the fact that (a) the account is in joint names <em>with the mother</em>, (b) funds in a joint account <em>prima facie</em> belong to the account holders in equal proportions (see [28(b)]), and (c) the Wife has the burden to prove her case that the funds belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given that the Wife has failed to prove that all the funds in POSB 027 XXX belong to the Husband, there is no need for me to address her case that there was dissipation of funds. That said, I wish to make a few observations. The Wife relies on a withdrawal of $49,000 on 8 July 2023 for her submission that there was dissipation of funds. I am not persuaded by this submission. <em>First</em>, it is the mother evidence that she had transferred the $49,000 to her other son. <em>Second</em>, a transfer of $49,000 does not seem all that unusual for this account. The bank book shows that between 2006 to 2020 (i.e., <em>before</em> the marriage), there were <em>eight</em> other instances where huge sums of $40,000 or more had been deposited/withdrawn from the account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">UOB 908 XXX</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I come to the joint account in UOB 908 XXX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     According to the Husband’s mother, this account was opened in 1999. At the material time, the Husband was only 20 years old, recently released from imprisonment, unemployed, and did not have money to deposit into the account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I accept the mother’s evidence that the account was operated by her solely and that the Husband did not contribute any funds into this account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Wife made the following submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the mother’s evidence was intended to avoid the Husband’s funds in the account from being liable for division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the $100,000 withdrawn from the account on 19 August 2022 should be added to the matrimonial pool because the marriage was already breaking down at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> To support this contention, the Wife’s counsel referred me to a quarrel between the parties in 2017 or 2018 which led to the Wife seeing a lawyer for advice on getting a divorce.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I am not persuaded by the Wife’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I have examined the bank records for the account. (The available records before me are from 2011 to 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>) I do not see anything therein that discredits the mother’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Wife had submitted that “there is nothing to suggest that it was the Husband <em>or</em> the Husband’s Mother who had managed the account” (emphasis added).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Wife acknowledged that it was <em>plausible</em> that the account was managed by the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As for the submission in [35(b)] above, I note that the $100,000 was broken up into three parts of $33,333 each – two parts were placed in two separate fixed deposits (in joint names with the Husband) and the remaining part was used to pay an insurance policy/fixed deposit (“<b>Policy</b>”) in full. According to the mother, she had bought the Policy using the Husband’s name – in case the insurers refused to insure her because of her age. The financial benefits under the Policy belonged to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> In my view, these transactions are consistent with the mother being the person who operated the UOB 908 XXX account and disposing of the funds as she pleased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I am unable to agree with the Wife that the withdrawal of $100,000 from the account had occurred at a time when divorce was “imminent”: <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [67] and [68].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It bears highlighting that the Wife did not file a divorce after seeing the lawyer in 2017 or 2018. The parties had continued to live together for the next four years. It was only in March 2023 that the Wife decided to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The $100,000 was withdrawn about <em>four months before</em> the Wife left the Flat (December 2022) and about <em>seven months before</em> she filed for divorce (March 2023). In <em>WQG v WQF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31045-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 13</a> at [2] and [3], the High Court declined to infer that a transaction that had occurred about two months before a divorce – a period that is <em>even shorter</em> than the present case – was intended to deplete the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">UOB 314 XXX</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, I turn to UOB 314 XXX. According to the Husband’s mother she had made the following transactions in connection with the account:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 29 October 2022, she withdrew $50,000 from UOB 908 XXX (joint account with the Husband).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Two days later (on 31 October 2022), she deposited the $50,000 into UOB 314 XXX, a fixed deposit account. The evidence shows that the fixed deposit had a tenor of 10 months (i.e., it matured on 31 August 2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 31 August 2023 (i.e., when the fixed deposited matured), the mother withdrew $50,000 from the account and deposited the funds into her joint account with her daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The above evidence is consistent with the bank records.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The fact that the mother could freely transfer $50,000

It is unclear whether the Husband will be able to buy/rent premises with the same level of convenience as the Flat to live with the Son. <em>Second</em>, there is a risk that the child will be spending more time on school days to commute between the Husband’s new residence and the Flat/the Son’s school.

My decision in respect of SUM 3441 can be found in <em>XHU v ZHV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32826-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 11</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that the Husband should have to pay the Wife costs, fixed at $2000 (all-in). They say that the Husband’s application in SUM 3441 was unmeritorious and had “unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of” the divorce proceedings. They also emphasise that the Husband had not pursued his discovery request in good faith.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband, on the other hand, after having been reminded to put in his submissions on the costs of SUM 3441, stated that he did “not have any cost to claim”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event, though the court can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27020-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 1</a> at [9] and [10] citing Rule 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32251-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 84</a> at [4] citing <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, the Wife is entitled to costs. That is because she had successfully resisted the Husband’s application for discovery in SUM 3441. The Husband did not manage to obtain the orders which he sought in SUM 3441.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of such costs, I take into account the fact that the Husband had only sought discovery in respect of two items, and that the affidavits and submissions were not particularly voluminous. While counsel for the Wife argues that his application was unmeritorious and that it was not taken out in good faith, they have not set out why this is the case, apart from pointing to the fact that this is evident from the Husband’s “haphazard application and pleadings”. In any event, I do not find that the Husband’s conduct warrants an upwards adjustment in the quantum of such costs to be awarded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is therefore ordered that the Husband shall pay the Wife the sum of $600, being the costs of SUM 3441.

In light of the issues raised by parties with respect to [T], I called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) and reserved my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Having received the CER, I fixed the matter for decision on 27 December 2024, which was re-fixed to 13 January 2025 at parties’ request. Shortly before the date of decision, the Wife’s counsel wrote a letter dated 2 January 2025 to the court to “highlight the Plaintiff’s ongoing and hostile conduct”. This invited a reply dated 8 January 2025 from the Husband refuting the Wife’s allegations as “a blatant attempt to mislead the court”. The Wife responded with a rebuttal dated 10 January 2025 “to address the Plaintiff’s numerous misleading and unsubstantiated allegations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the resumed hearing on 13 January 2025, I reminded counsel that when the court had reserved judgment as I had done in this case, no new evidence should be presented without the leave of court: see <em>VYP v VYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26994-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 40</a> (at [36]). I also reminded counsel that it was a discourtesy to the court to make further submission without seeking leave: see <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a> (at [9]). As these letters were presented to the court after judgment was reserved, I made it clear that I did not consider the contents of the letters in reaching my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When giving my decision, I provided brief grounds to parties and indicated that these might be elaborated on and supplemented with fuller grounds if required. As the Wife has appealed the whole of my decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 8/2025 filed on 24 January 2025, I set out below my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I begin with the Wife’s application to “set aside/vary” the Consent Order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. The starting point is s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), which provides that the court “may, at any time, it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband submitted that the Wife’s application was confusing as it was not entirely clear if the Wife was trying to set aside the Consent Order or vary the Consent Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I agreed that clarity was important as the thresholds for setting aside and varying a consent order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets are different. Moreover, the Wife’s application went beyond the division of matrimonial assets. It extended to the setting aside and variation of orders in relation to custody, care and control and child maintenance, for which different provisions and considerations apply. Yet, the entirety of the Wife’s submissions was premised on s 112(4) of the Charter, which is applicable only to the division of matrimonial assets. This was unsatisfactory as it obfuscated the issues that had to be determined by the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the deficiency in the Wife’s submissions, I gave careful consideration to the merits of her application in accordance with the applicable provisions and relevant case law with respect to each area of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be set aside</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The threshold for setting aside a consent order relating to the division of matrimonial assets was set out in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Chew Koon</em> [2005] 1 SLR (R) 548 (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”) and discussed in <em>AOO v AON</em> [2011] 4 SLR1169 (at [10]) and <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM v AYL</em>”) (at [17]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [6]), “[a] court would interfere with an order of court obtained by consent, only on just and equitable grounds”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Choo Han Teck J explained (at [5]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court “may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”. But this section, and the authorities referred to by Mr Chia, should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in <em>Dean v Dean</em> [1978] 3 All ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[W]here an agreement between the parties had been reached at arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would probably be unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Hence, to set aside a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(4) of the Charter, an applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors: see <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a> (at [8]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> A vitiating factor is a contractual doctrine that includes misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence, duress, unconscionability, as well as illegality and public policy: see <em>TR v TQ</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) (at [97]). While the precise application of each of the vitiating factors to consent orders made in the matrimonial context has not been definitively decided (see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15])), some of the reasons that have been cited in setting-aside applications include duress, misrepresentation and undue influence: for example, see <em>UMM v UML</em> and <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> (“<em>ATZ v AUA</em>”) (at [22]). In addition, the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties may also result in a consent order being set aside: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [31]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In the present case, the Wife claimed that the Consent Order was obtained through “duress, undue influence and misrepresentation” which severely compromised her ability to make a free and informed decision.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She sought to set aside the Consent Order on grounds that she categorized as follows: (a) misrepresentation; (b) duress and undue influence; and (c) emotional and psychological coercion.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I found that the Wife did not satisfy the requisite threshold to set aside the Consent Order. I elaborate on my reasons below, adopting the categories framed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Misrepresentation</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   False Legal representation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife alleged that the Husband had falsely claimed that the appointed lawyer was acting on behalf of both parties and yet consistently denied the Wife’s requests to communicate directly with the lawyer. This left the Wife without proper legal representation, making her vulnerable to the Husband’s exploitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following WhatsApp messages:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:58 PM – [H]: It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree. You want time slot, put in. You want cpf refund, I put in. You want joint account to spell out, I put in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:59 PM – [H]: Ok, then I ask them to draft, you can ask them as you are also the client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was that there was no such false representation. The involvement of the lawyer was limited to merely drafting the terms based on the discussions between the parties themselves. The Husband said that he was not well versed in legal terminology and mistakenly believed that engaging a lawyer was to ensure the proper handling of all necessary paperwork. During the meeting at his lawyer’s office, it was explicitly stated that the lawyer represented him alone, and the clauses in the IJ were drafted pursuant to parties’ private negotiations and agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife was apprised of her right to seek independent legal advice but made a personal decision not to personally engage a lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Further, the Husband said that the Wife had not presented the complete WhatsApp message.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[W]    I am uncomfortable with your lawyer, only acting in your benefit without any consideration for [T]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I am already giving you care and control part … all the house and car</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">who is squeezing who</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[H]    It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree. You want time slot, put in. You want cpf refund, I put in. You want joint account to spell out, I put in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[W]    all I am asking is to spell out clearly not to have any misunderstanding …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As noted by the learned authors in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Contract (Volume 7) (LexisNexis)</em> at [80.172]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Misrepresentation refers to an untrue or misleading statement that induces the formation of a contract. It may operate as an important defence in the hands of a representee to vitiate a contract …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As elaborated at [80.189]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">An essential ingredient of an operative misrepresentation is that it influenced or induced the representee in his decision to enter into the contract. There would be no inducement if the representee did not know of the representation or was aware of its untruth or was not influenced by it, as where he would have entered into the contract even had he known the true facts or where he relied on his own judgment or investigations. Inducement refers to the causal relation, which is a question of fact, between the representation and action on the part of the representee to act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The WhatsApp message produced by the Wife showed that the Husband had represented to her that the lawyer was “our lawyer” and that “you are also the client”. While this was <em>prima facie</em> a misrepresentation, I found no evidence to suggest that it was fraudulently made. When the Wife attended at the lawyer’s office, she was told that the lawyer represented the Husband alone. This was evident from the acknowledgement signed by the Wife in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths, which stated as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Wife had considered the terms of the agreement and was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. Given these undisputed facts, the Wife could not be laboring under any misapprehension when she entered into the agreement. The misrepresentation was corrected and could not have influenced or induced her at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Moreover, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her own judgment in her negotiations with the Husband. This was borne out by her affidavit, examples of which are reproduced below:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.64%\"><col width=\"79.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Para 51.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">However, when I received the first draft of the divorce documents, I noticed that my access to [T] was stated as “reasonable access”.

Clearly, she was exercising independent judgment. There was no causal relation as such between the misrepresentation and her decision to enter into the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife claimed that without proper legal representation, she was vulnerable to the Husband’s exploitation. The Wife alleged that the Husband exploited her limited knowledge of Singapore’s divorce laws and her cultural background from Thailand, where women’s rights were less protected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, it was undisputed that she was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. It was her prerogative to seek help if she needed assistance. It would be inequitable for the Wife to blame the Husband for her lack of legal representation when she could have taken reasonable steps to obtain independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As was similarly observed by Debbie Ong J (as she then was) in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Starting with the arguments on the Husband’s capacity to appreciate the documents before him, if the Husband genuinely did not understand the terms of the 1<sup>st</sup> DCO, he could have sought assistance or expressed that he needed more time to consider them. As noted by the DJ, the Husband is educated, and held the rank of First Warrant Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces before his retirement. I also observe that more than a year elapsed between his signing of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> DCOs. I emphasise that it is a serious matter for one to sign a legal document before a Commissioner of Oaths or before a lawyer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     More pertinently, the picture that emerged from her evidence and the contemporaneous WhatsApp messages between the parties was simply incongruous with the case she tried to make out to the court. I found her to be assertive, and she certainly did not come across as one who could be easily induced, influenced, coerced or exploited. The fact that she was able to get the Husband to concede to her demands spoke for itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it should be noted that in a WhatsApp message to the Husband, the Wife herself had acknowledged that “we had good amicable agreement”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This message was sent on 27 September 2021,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> five months after the Consent Order was recorded. It put beyond doubt that the Husband had not taken any unfair advantage over her in the course of negotiating and settling the terms, and that the agreement reached was consensual. In light of all the evidence, it seemed more likely that the Wife was seeking to take advantage of the innocent misrepresentation by the Husband to advance her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Deception in Custody/Access Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife also alleged that the Husband misled her about the feasibility of shared custody and control of their child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.58%\"><col width=\"8.86%\"><col width=\"57.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">-</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: please change to joint care and control</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: I won’t sign</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.22 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: It can’t be done</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.23 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: So far I am very reasonable, trying work out the best for all</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/3/21, 12:01 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: 2.

There was nothing to prevent her from visiting the website and verifying the information for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Moreover, it was reasonable to infer that the Wife had some knowledge of the law, as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to shared care and control, which is a legal construct used by the court to make arrangements to support families where the child’s parents have separated: see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> (at [10] – [12]). The Wife would have known that the court may grant both parents shared care and control as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to “SHARED care and control”. If there was any doubt in her mind about the legal position, she could have sought independent legal advice if the issue was of concern to her. As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [5]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Wife was prepared, for her own private reasons, to acquiesce to sole care and control without seeking independent legal advice, it would be inequitable for her to accuse the Husband of deception, especially when she knew that he had relied on materials obtained from a legal website.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Deception in Financial Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Wife also alleged that the Husband had concealed his personal assets and directed her attention solely towards certain shared assets, preventing her from seeing the full picture of their financial situation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> She listed the following matrimonial assets that were not included in the IJ:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a.     Monies in parties CPF accounts</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b.     Parties’ matrimonial car estimated value of $90,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c.     Singapore Savings Bond of estimated $90,000 belonging to the Plaintiff and $30,000 belonging to [the Wife].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d.     Cash in hand at home amounting to an estimated value of SGD$3,000 (foreign currency).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>e.     Plaintiff’s savings account in China bank and other savings accounts in his sole name which [the Wife] have no knowledge of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>f.     Plaintiff’s Multiplier account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_g\"></a>g.     Plaintiff’s insurance policies and investment accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_h\"></a>h.     Other valuables estimated to be worth $10,000 (i.e jewelleries which the Plaintiff’s mother gifted to [the Wife] during the marriage, exercise bike, piano, household appliances/furniture).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     She submitted that the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties might result in a consent order being set aside by the court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response, the Husband pointed out that the Wife had a S$85,5000 Singapore saving bond under her name<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, a multiplier account which had approximately S$50,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and insurance policy and investment account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and she had drawn S$3,000 annually from the family fund to either save into her Thai bank account or her relative’s bank account to keep the cash somewhere which he did not know about.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> There were no jewelleries except a wedding ring which the Wife had already taken away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The assets listed in the IJ were the main matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I found no merits in the Wife’s allegations. Firstly, it was contemplated in clause 3g(c) of the IJ that the parties “shall each retain all other assets in his/her own names.” It should be noted that these “other assets” included assets in her sole name, such as monies in her CPF account and bank accounts, which were within her knowledge. Hence, she could not be oblivious that there were other assets that were not expressly listed in the IJ. Indeed, the whole point of clause 3g(c) was to allow the parties to retain these “other assets” in his or her sole name. In addition, the parties had also agreed to clause 3(g)(d) which made it clear that neither party “shall have any further claim against each other”. In short, the fact that the Wife was able to produce a list of matrimonial assets that were not expressly included in the IJ was not a basis by itself to set aside the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Secondly, if the complete accounting of assets was important to her, she could have requested that parties exchange a list of assets before agreeing to clause 3g(c) of the IJ, bearing in mind that the duty of full and frank disclosure cuts both ways. If she had done so and there was non-disclosure on the part of the Husband, she would be amply justified to set aside the Consent Order. But that was not the case here. The Wife was content to accept clause 3g(c) without the need for mutual disclosure. Contrary to her submissions, there was no concealment, let alone deception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Duress and undue influence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife submitted that that the Husband exerted undue influence over her by repeatedly pressuring her to agree to the Consent Order, using emotional manipulation and threats. She said that the Husband had insisted that if she did not agree to give him sole care and control of their child, he might remove himself from their lives, leaving the child without a father. The Husband also pressured the Wife during her busy work hours and claimed that he might only have a few years left to live. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Husband said that in the interest of promoting the child’s wellbeing, he agreed to joint custody as requested by the Wife. However, joint custody entailed fulfilling responsibilities towards the child, which the Wife had often failed to recognise. For example, in February 2021, when he enrolled the child in a preparatory course for the Gifted Education Program and personally covered the cost of $4,846, cooperation from the Wife was extremely challenging.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband said that the Wife was well aware that granting care and control to him was in the best interests of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The child’s wellbeing had been diligently attended to over the past three years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband implemented long-term plans to secure the child’s present and future needs, including relocating to a more conducive residence in preparation for the Primary School Leaving Examination, procuring property to cater to the child’s post-primary education requirements, and supplementing the joint account with additional funds to endure the child’s educational aspirations were adequately supported.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Testimonies from school teachers during teacher seminars affirmed the child’s happiness at school and flourishing social relationships.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>ATZ v AUA</em>, the court made the following observations (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it is normally the case (as in the present) that parties to a marriage would invoke the doctrines of undue influence or duress to set aside a marital agreement, given the emotionally charged circumstances in which such agreements are normally negotiated and executed. The existence of independent legal advice would normally be a strong indication of informed consent, which would undermine arguments relating to undue influence or duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, while the Wife was not legally advised in the entry into the agreement, she was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. In the same vein, this would undermine her arguments relating to undue influence and duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Moreover, as noted earlier, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently. In her own words, “we had good amicable settlement”. This could not be the case if she had felt pressured by the Husband to enter into an agreement she did not agree to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(5)   Emotional and psychological coercion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Wife also alleged that the Husband employed coercive and manipulative tactics during the divorce process to pressure the Wife into agreeing to an unfair settlement. The Wife claimed that the Husband avoided creating written evidence of his actions by insisting on verbal communications, leaving the Wife emotionally distressed after each interaction. The Husband played on the Wife’s compassion and vulnerability by making unverified claims about his health and resorted to deception, false blame, and threats throughout the process.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The picture painted by the Wife was that of a conniving husband taking advantage of a vulnerable spouse. However, this picture did not cohere with the objective evidence. Firstly, if the Husband had wanted to avoid creating written evidence, the Wife’s affidavits could not be replete with numerous written communications of their negotiations and related matters which she had relied on extensively in support of her case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also made use of some of these statements to disparage him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Secondly, as explained earlier, I found that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently in negotiating and settling the terms of the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Thirdly, in her supporting affidavit, the Wife averred as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… The Plaintiff created the illusion that my choices were <b>voluntary</b>. However, <b>upon closer examination</b>, I <b>now realize</b> that the Plaintiff deliberately orchestrated the entire divorce “discussion” toward unfair outcome for me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On closer examination, it would become apparent that this was an admission by the Wife that she had had entered into the agreement <em>voluntarily</em> at the material time. This is because it was only “now” and “upon closer examination” that she realised that she had been coerced. That being the case, she could not have acted under coercion when she entered into the agreement, as this would involve a diametrically opposite state of mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Indeed, in another part of her affidavit, the Wife had also stated that it was “<em>[o]nly in hindsight</em>” that she “<em>came to realize</em>” that she was coerced into signing the agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Hence, the case advanced by the Wife appeared to be an <em>ex post facto</em> attempt to conjure up a case of coercion when, based on her own admissions, none existed at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Finally, as noted earlier, the Wife had in a WhatsApp message to the Husband acknowledged that “we had good amicable settlement”. This put beyond doubt that she had acted on her free will and was not coerced into signing the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For the reasons set out above, I found that the requisite threshold for setting aside the Consent Order was not met. To sum up this part of my grounds, the following observations of Choo Han Teck J in <em>VWQ v VWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a> (at [9]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties, and the courts would be slow to re-write their contract. Privately settled terms negotiated by the parties, especially in family matters are to be encouraged. As such, they should be respected, and not lightly changed. Otherwise, one party may lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to call in aid the provisions in the Women’s Charter to vary their agreement (<em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a>) when they feel that the bargain was not to their liking subsequently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As also noted in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [12]), the need for finality is a significant consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it must not be forgotten that consent orders are the end of a process of “give-and-take” to harmoniously resolve a dispute between parties. There is another party, the Wife in this case, who has participated in negotiations towards an agreement and who has relied on the resolution process to move on from this dispute. The need for finality is a significant consideration: see <em>AYM</em> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I turn next to the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15] and [22]–[23]), the Court of Appeal made it clear that s 112(4) was not intended to confer upon the court a jurisdiction writ large, but a limited flexibility to adjust an order for the division of matrimonial assets already made. This would be, <em>a fortiori</em>, the case when the order of court was premised upon a consent order entered into between the parties themselves. Once the order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented or spent inasmuch as everything that was required to be done had been effected and the assets concerned had in fact been distributed to the parties concerned, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. Where the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court had not been completely effected or implemented, the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for division of matrimonial assets only when the order was unworkable or had become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As the case put forward by the Wife did not show that the Consent Order was unworkable or had become unworkable, there was no basis to vary the Consent Order. Moreover, the Consent Order with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As such, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. On either ground, the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody, care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn next to the Wife’s application to set aside/vary the Consent Order in relation to the custody, care and control of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Wife alleged that the Husband had engaged in parental alienation and attempted to exclude the Wife from the child’s life while falsely accusing the Wife of being an irresponsible parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Following the divorce, the Husband repeatedly reneged on agreed terms regarding the Wife’s access to the child and the matrimonial flat. His communication and actions became increasingly uncooperative, hostile, and abusive, including denying access to the child on public holidays, changing visitation arrangements without consent, and preventing video calls.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Wife alleged that the Husband had inflicted psychological harm on the child by coercing him to lie to the Wife about his whereabouts and activities. The Husband’s behavior, which included making unilateral decisions about the child’s schooling, health, and travel plans, significantly disrupted the co-parenting relationship and negatively impacted the child’s wellbeing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The Wife also accused the Husband of manipulating the child into referring to his new wife as “mummy” against the child’s will, using threats and punishment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> The Husband had also fed him false information and used access as a means of control, resulting in the child experiencing panic and anxiety.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife said that she had been the primary caregiver for the child since his birth and was deeply involved in his overall development, including academic preparation and various activities. Despite the Husband’s attempts to undermine the Wife’s role, the child had consistently expressed a desire to reside primarily with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The Wife requested for care and control of the child with the supervised access to the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Husband contended that the Wife’s baseless and frivolous allegations of her being misled and misguided into letting him have care and control of the child was simply untrue and unsubstantiated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> It was agreed between parties that the Husband would have care and control of the child as he had been the primary caregiver for the child since he was born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Since the Wife moved out from the matrimonial home in 2020, he had independently shouldered the responsibility of overseeing the child’s academic development and the child was thriving under his care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Husband said that despite the challenges of managing this responsibility single-handedly, he devoted his limited time with the child to providing guidance and encouragement. The child had consistently demonstrated improvement in academic performance and had earned numerous achievements. In a noteworthy accomplishment, the child secured a top three position in the class award for the first time in 2022. Even amidst the ongoing court proceedings since 2023, the Husband single-handedly persevered in maintaining the child’s academic excellence, resulting in him receiving the top three in the class award once again.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The child had numerous other academic awards and achievements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband said that the Wife moved out almost four years ago to pursue her own “happiness” but after learning about the Husband’s remarriage, she initiated the current lawsuit to disrupt the hard-earned stability that the child and the Husband had been enjoying.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> The Husband contended that he had dutifully facilitated her stated access terms pursuant to the Consent Order but the Wife was belatedly demanding for more access timings after she learned of the Husband’s remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Section 128 of the Charter provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     For the same reasons explained earlier, I found no basis to set aside the Consent Order for the custody, care and control of the child. Be that as it may, the central issue was whether there was any basis to vary the Consent Order. In practical terms, any order relating to the custody, care and control of the child would be forward-looking, as it would not be possible to undo the past, unlike the division of matrimonial assets where the order could be undone <em>ab initio</em>, and the assets redivided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The legal principles for the variation of a consent order on custody, care and control are markedly different from those applicable to the variation of a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets. This is why, as I had emphasized at [13] above, clarity of the submissions is important.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> (at [16] &amp; [17]), which concerned an application to vary the parties’ by-consent access orders, the Appellate Division (“AD”) held that the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances. The AD quoted with approval, the following passage from <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Relationships are dynamic. A parent who is not emotionally close to a child at the time an access order is made may, through time, build a much closer relationship with the child subsequently. For example, a young three­ year old child may have been clingy to his mother at the time the court orders care and control to the mother and limited access to the father. As the child grows older and builds a closer relationship with his father, it may be in his welfare to encourage increased access when he is, say, five years old. The child may have outgrown the phase of high dependence on and dinginess to his mother. There may not have been any one particular identifiable event that marks a material change in circumstances between the time he was three and five years old, but because relationships are dynamic, circumstances may have sufficiently changed such that a variation is warranted for his welfare. Hence, the court ought not to read s 128 of the Women's Charter too narrowly, but should take both a principled and pragmatic approach to the determination of a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As noted in <em>UBQ v UBR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29508-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 10</a> (“<em>UBQ v UBR</em>”) ([at [52]), the paramount consideration in a variation application is the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     From my review of the affidavits and the CER, I was satisfied that there had been a material change in circumstances for the purposes of the variation application. I noted that [T] was an emerging adolescent capable of forming an independent view. It was clear to me that [T] shared a close relationship with the Wife and desired to spend more time with her, compared to the current care arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     As this was sufficient for invoking the court’s power to vary the Consent Order, I did not find it necessary or helpful to dwell into the parties’ allegations in my brief grounds to assign blame. Neither do I think it is necessary or helpful to do so now, bearing in mind the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and not the past conduct of the parents: see <em>UBQ v UBR</em> (at [49]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     I found that both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him. The Husband had provided the child a stable living environment and ensured that his daily needs were adequately met. The Husband was committed in supporting the child over academic matters and had contributed significantly to the child’s academic achievement while the Wife had also been intentional in engaging the child in a wide range of activities and was attuned to the child’s emotional wellbeing. However, while both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him, they struggled with communication and co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     [T] was an intelligent child who had been doing well academically. Although he shared a close relationship with each parent, it was clear to me that he had been exposed to prolonged parental conflict and was torn between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The parties were agreeable to continue with the joint custody order. The main dispute centred on care with control. The Wife was seeking a reversal of care and control while the Husband wanted to continue having sole care and control of [T].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Section 125(2) of the Charter provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration is to be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court is to have regard —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Given the Husband’s strength in providing the academic support, granting the Wife sole care and control would deprive the child of the support by the Husband. However, granting the Husband sole care and control would also deprive the child of the time and attention that he so desired from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     [T] was a mature individual and at an age where he was capable of greater independence and expressing an independent opinion. Given his close relationship with both parents as well as his desire to spend more time with the Wife, I found that a shared care and control arrangement where he would be able to receive the support and care from both parents would be beneficial for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In addition, the parents would benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to work on their communication and co-parenting skills. [T] would also benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to support him amidst the parental conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     According, I varied the orders relating to custody, care and control as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parents be granted joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Parents be granted shared care and control of the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Husband to have care and control of the child from Saturday 8 pm to Wednesday (before school).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wife to have care and control of the child from Wednesday (after school) to Saturday 8 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parents to share equally the school and public holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Overseas Travel</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parents are at liberty to travel overseas with the child subject to giving the other party at least two months’ notice of the duration of travel, itinerary of travel, including flight details, accommodation address and emergency contact details. The notice period may be shortened by consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband shall release the child’s passport to the Wife at least 2 weeks prior to the intended date of departure or earlier if the said passport is required for travel visa application. The Wife shall return the child’s passport to the Husband when returning the child to his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Mutual Agreement</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Parties may vary the care arrangement by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Make-up parenting time</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Where a parent is denied parenting time with the child as a result of the unilateral decision of the other parent, the parent shall be entitled to make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Parents should endeavour to resolve any such dispute amicably before making an application to the Court for make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Counselling Support</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Parents and child to continue to receive counselling support at FAM@FSC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In my brief grounds, I had urged both parents to take positive steps to reduce their conflict, such as by exercising grace and flexibility in co-parenting and refraining from inflaming the situation. I reminded the parties that parental responsibility included supporting the child in having a close relationship with the other parent: see <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> (at [10]). The parties were advised to take heed of the following observations of Debbie Ong JAD in <em>DDN v DDO</em> (at [17]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements” …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     I emphasized that parental conflict was harmful to the child and made reference to the observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a> (at [40]). I also reiterated the following reminder in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [47]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parents must <em>find the resolve</em> to overcome the difficulties in co-parenting by a strong <em>commitment to discharging their parental responsibility</em>. Litigation has harmful effects on the child – materially, because the family loses in incurring litigation expenses, and psychologically, because conflict affects the whole family in ways not easily visible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     It is hence disappointing that despite the reminders and exhortations, the Wife had decided to appeal against the shared care and control order instead of doing her utmost to make the ordered arrangement work. While it is her prerogative as a litigant to do so, it would also mean that the litigation will be protracted. This would not be in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Finally, the Wife had also sought an order for the Husband to pay the Wife a reasonable amount of maintenance for the child. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The relevant provisions relating to the variation of maintenance for children are in ss 72 and 73 of the Charter. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> (at [15]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 73 provides that any agreement relating to maintenance may be varied where the court is “satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”. … the provision is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances of the parents as <em>a</em> basis for varying the maintenance for the child. Whether or not this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is of course a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     It is trite law that both parents have a duty to maintain the child. As regards the apportionment of maintenance, it is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In the present case, I found that the variation of the care and control arrangement would constitute a material change in circumstances. However, as noted above, whether this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of the case.

Each had brought an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against each other. SS 217 of 2024 (“SS 217”) is the Wife’s application against the Husband for a PPO. In addition, the Wife also seeks a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) to exclude the Husband from her bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 218 of 2024 (“SS 218”) is the Husband’s application against the Wife for a PPO. In addition, the Husband also seeks a DEO against the Wife to exclude her from his bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband was represented by Mr Ignatious Cha (“Mr Cha”) and Ms Pearlyn Yeo (“Ms Yeo”). The Wife was represented by Mr Leong Zhen Yang (“Mr Leong”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the trial and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is hornbook law that to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities (<em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) at [13] – [14]; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [5] – [7]; <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the respondent had either committed family violence, or was likely to commit family violence; and that</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is necessary for the court to grant the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, the starting point is found in the definition set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”). That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In addition to ordering a PPO, a DEO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the “protection or personal safety of the applicant”. That is made clear by s 65(5)(<em>a</em>) of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    A protection order may, where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant, provide for such orders as the court thinks fit having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including any one or more of the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the granting of the right of exclusive occupation to any protected person of the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence by excluding the person against whom the order is made from the shared residence or specified part thereof, regardless of whether the shared residence is solely owned or leased by the person against whom the order is made or jointly owned or leased by the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 217 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I deal first, with the Wife’s application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 217</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       These are the incidents which the Wife relies on in support of her application for a PPO and a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 11 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to the Wife, this incident took place at around 10 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband had warned her to not show their son any YouTube videos on the projector and threatened to switch off the projector if his demands were not met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     An argument ensued. The Husband allegedly swung his left hand towards the Wife’s face. He stopped mid-blow such that his hand brushed past her right ear forcefully. The Wife says that the Husband did want to slap her, but stopped himself because he knew that there was a CCTV installed in her bedroom. She says that Husband would have been more brazen in his use of force had there not been a CCTV installed in her room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This incident was captured on the CCTV installed in the Wife’s room. The footage was played in court. It clearly shows that the Husband had tried to slap the Wife. He had, all of a sudden, swung his hand very quickly towards the Wife’s face. The Wife recoiled and tried to shield herself. Her earbud was dislodged and fell to the ground. The Wife retaliated by slapping the Husband twice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband had, in the course of his re-examination, given an explanation for having acted in this manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Right. Now, earlier in relation to the 11th December 2023 incident, Mr. Leong said that you did not just move your hand, but swung forcefully such that Ms. XJB’s earpiece dropped on the floor and you said you could explain. What do you wish to explain?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Mmm. Mmm. Okay, uh, on the 11th December, uh, twenty twen---uh, 2023, um, I noticed that, uh---uh, Ms. XJB is showing the, uh, projector to the kids in their rooms. And usually, when they show the projector, then the light is off, uh, turn off and---and they just show that, uh---uh, projector on the---on the---on the wall. And this one could, uh, strain the---the child eyes and does---and then---and [inaudible] uh, screen times. And, uh, because I want to, uh, discuss this with, uh, Ms. XJB’s, um, in a manner way. And, uh, during the---during discussion I found out that she didn’t, uh, listen carefully and didn’t pay attention to it. And I found out that, um, she have ear---earbud on her---on her ear. So, um, my intention just to take out the earbud, uh, from the ear and so we can have, um---um, so she can listen and have a conversation in a manner way. Uh, this is just to take out the, uh, earbud from---from her ear. And while I---while I take out the earbud, she quickly, uh, grab my hands and that’s caused the earbud to fall on the floor. And not just that, she also, um---uh, pulled my hands and pulled my body until I, uh, until my body is pulling---pull in front. Then not---not enough with that, she also hit me twice on my body. And I have to use my hands to, um, to defend it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband had also argued, in written submissions, that he had no intention of placing the Wife in fear of hurt, or that he had intended to cause hurt to the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He submitted that he “had simply wanted to stop the Wife from closing the door as parties h[ad] not addressed” the issue of the Wife letting their son watch YouTube videos on the projector in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I do not accept the explanations which the Husband had offered for his actions on that day. He had indeed swung his hand very quickly. It was aimed at the Wife’s face. Up till that juncture, it was apparent that both parties were engaging in conversation that was not particularly heated in any way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The circumstances as well as the Husband’s act of swinging his hand therefore do not support his stated intention of wanting to remove the earbud from the Wife’s ear so that they could have an uninterrupted conversation. It is thus clear to me that the Husband had committed family violence in that he had, to use the language of limb (a) (see above at [6]), wilfully, knowingly, or had attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, I add that insofar as the Husband alleges that the Wife had, by slapping him twice in retaliation, committed family violence, I do not find that to be the case. It is clear from the video that the Wife had been provoked by the Husband’s actions. Her two slaps appeared to have been done out of anger and frustration at how the Husband had behaved. She had also subsequently taken steps to disengage and de-escalate the conflict by closing her room door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Both the Wife and the Husband rely on this incident in support of their respective applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     This is the Wife’s account of events. She stated that she had planned to take their son to Johor Bahru.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband had given approval to do so. Their son, however, kicked up a fuss. The Husband construed this as their son being reluctant to go on the trip. He refused to hand over their son’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife describes the events which followed that took place at the void deck. She says that there was an argument. She said she wanted to call the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was when the Husband took their son’s passport and slammed it hard onto her left shoulder and the “motion came into contact” with her cheek, “causing a bruise”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife called the police immediately. She also exhibits, in her affidavit, a copy of a discharge summary dated 28 December 2023 showing the “diagnosis of the injury as contusion on” her cheek. In the course of her testimony, the Wife also said that the Husband’s younger sister had scratched her on the cheek during this incident. When she saw the doctor, she had told him that she suffered injuries on her left shoulder and cheek. According to her, the doctor could see that “there were red marks” on her cheek, and that the doctor also examined her shoulder and told her to monitor it for a few days.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by slamming the passport into her shoulder which resulted in a bruise, committed family violence within the definition of either limbs (a) or (b) (see above at [6]) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband, on the other hand, presented a different version of events in his affidavit. According to him, that incident had taken place at 11.30 pm. He had returned to the matrimonial home with his family members in tow. They had just come back from a trip to Kuala Lumpur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband states that he had argued with the Wife. He wanted to let their son sleep as he was exhausted. The Wife, on the other hand, refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Both the Husband and the Wife took their quarrel to the ground floor. The Wife continued to insist that she be allowed to bring their son to Malaysia. She asked for his passport. The Husband says that because it was raining at the time, and for their son’s sake, he used his son’s passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder and asked that she let their son return to the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife became aggressive. She accused the Husband of punching her. She screamed loudly and told both her parents, as well as her boyfriend, that the Husband had punched her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband attempted to disengage by retreating into the lift. The Wife, however, managed to trigger the lift alarm button. The police were called and officers eventually arrived on the scene.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Wife has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband had hit her forcefully on her shoulder with the passport which resulted in a bruise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For one, it is not disputed that the photo, marked “W2”, was indeed of the Wife’s shoulder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The time stamp indicates that the photograph was taken 2 days after this incident. The photograph does show what appears to be a faint bruise on the Wife’s shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Aside from the photographic evidence, there is also the Husband’s testimony. His account of events was that he had used the passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder. He does not dispute having made contact with the Wife’s left shoulder. This was what he had said in cross-examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.3%\"><col width=\"80.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Q:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mr. XJC, would you therefore agree that Ms. XJB’s evidence that you slammed the passport is consistent with what you said about---in---at paragraph 8 of your affidavit?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Your Honour, if I may---uh, if I may---uh, the word, the---what the lawyer I mean, say is “slam” which is I don’t agree with the “slam” word, it’s a tap.

You can disagree.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my judgment, the Husband’s use of the word “tap” was an attempt to downplay the force he had actually used during the incident. I find that he had slammed the passport into the Wife’s shoulder which resulted in a bruise. The Husband’s account of merely tapping the Wife on her shoulder is not consistent with the context in which the incident took place, which was amidst a quarrel. Having been showed evidence in the form of videos of other quarrels between the parties, I consider it likely that this quarrel on 27 December 2023 was also a heated one. The Husband’s account as to the amount of force he had used is therefore less plausible than the Wife’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Having found that the Husband had “slammed” the passport into the Wife’s left shoulder and caused a bruise, I also find that such an act falls squarely within limb (b) of the definition of family violence set out in s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 3 February 2024 (the “Air Tag Incident”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On this date, the Wife discovered that the Husband had planted an Apple Air Tag tracker in their son’s necklace.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Wife claims that this would allow the Husband to track their whereabouts when she takes the son out. She further claims that the Husband is doing this as a means of “conducting surveillance” on her. Consequently, she feels worn out mentally, extremely vulnerable and worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     She made a police report about this incident. That report is also exhibited in her affidavit. The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by planting an Apple Air Tag in their son’s bag to track her movements, committed an act of family violence within the meaning of limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband, in the course of his testimony, did not deny placing an Apple Air tag tracker in his son’s necklace, as well as his bag.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Husband claims that he had done so to ensure his son’s safety and that he had seen the need for this after December 2023. This was because he had noticed that whenever the Wife sent their son to school, and picked him up, the Wife’s close male friend would be present.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This led the Husband to be concerned about his son’s safety. As he explained:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[A]fter the fetching the school---from the---from the school, she frequently, uh, bring the child’s together with the this---third party, and, uh---they put---they do things, uh, together like, uh, dinner together, even watch movie together, evens, uh, go to shopping malls together. Yah. So, uh, this has been repeatings and when the kids go home and---and told me that, uh, there is this, uh, that’s the---there’s another guy that involved in this. And I repeatings mention to Ms. XJB, which is my wife to say I---do not do this---uh, do not do in front of the kids. Want to do is, uh, do your own, don’t involve the kids. Yah. And she---uh, she’s just ignoring me and just keep continue doing that. Yah. So, for me, uh, there’s a third party involved and some time they reach home it’s quite late sometimes. I can see from the time here is, uh, 11:00 or some time it reach homes, uh, past midnight as well. Uh, until the kids already sleeping and when---when they reach home, the kids already sleeping. So, uh, and she didn’t tell me where they go and---and what---what they do and did they go. So, I found it as a signs of me to---to me---need to know, uh, whether or not my son is in the safety. So, I need to like at least to know, uh, where I can find my son, if need---if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It appears that the Husband may have had one other reason for placing an Apple Air Tag on the son’s belongings – that was, to find out if his Wife was having an affair, and if so, who she was having an affair with. The Husband had told me that he had first learnt about the Wife’s close male friend from their son. When he confronted the Wife about this, she mentioned that he was merely a Grab driver.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Her story soon changed – she subsequently gave other conflicting accounts as to who this man was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s decision to place an Apple Air tag in his son’s bag was likely motivated by an incident which took place on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2023. He was looking at his Wife’s phone and when he tried to make a video call on her phone, he noticed that there was already an active video call in progress. This was what he saw:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"24.66%\"><col width=\"75.34%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yes.

I do not find that the Husband had planted the air tags with the purpose or intention of stalking the Wife. Had he intended to do so, the air tags would have either been planted on her belongings, or cleverly concealed. This was not the case. As the Wife herself had testified:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Now, Ms. XJB, was the Apple AirTag stitched to some secret compartment of the child’s bag?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Yes, inside the compartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Ms. XJB, the---the question was yes or no.

Now, for that Apple AirTag hidden in your son’s bag, you said that you disposed of it, correct?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     As a matter of law, to establish that there has been family violence as defined in limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter, it must be shown that the respondent had: a) committed harassment, b) that such harassment is continual, and c) that this had been done with the intention to, or with the knowledge that such action would, cause the applicant to suffer “anguish”: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [6(d)]; <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [37] – [38]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23569-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 104</a> at [8] (see also <em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a>). I do not find that the Husband’s actions of planting the Apple Air Tag in the son’s belongings constitute harassment towards the Wife, nor do I find that he had done so with the intention of causing her “anguish”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 November 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This incident, according to the Wife, took place at around 9.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She had returned home from work. The son had not bathed. The Wife took their son to the toilet for a bath.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     During this time, the Husband entered the Wife’s room without her permission. He rummaged through her bag and checked her handphone. The Wife did not consent to this. She says at that time, the both of them were contemplating divorce. It was thus likely that the Husband was looking for evidence to “build his case for ancillary matters in the divorce”. The Wife says the Husband had, by going through her phone, violated her privacy. She also says that the Husband’s actions fall within limb (d) of the definition of family violence (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband’s explanation was that he had done this for the sake of their son. He explained that when he tried to text the Wife, she did not pick up. He had therefore gone into her room, picked up her phone, and used his phone to send her a message on WhatsApp to see if she could receive it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He admitted that he had done this despite knowing that relations between himself and the Wife were not good, and that if the Wife discovered that he had been rummaging through her belongings, it would only serve to worsen matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, denied that he had gone into the Wife’s room on previous occasions and rummaged through her belongings, and checked her phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I do not find this incident which the Wife complained of falls within the definition of family violence under limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. It has not been established that the Husband had indeed, on other previous occasions, snuck into the Wife’s room, rummaged through her belongings, and checked the contents of her phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this incident, the Wife was spending time with their son on the sofa in the living room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Husband had come and sat next to her despite knowing that she was uncomfortable being in close proximity with him. The Wife alleges that the Husband continued to harass her by moving close to their son. She believes that the Husband wanted to exploit her fear of being near him to deny her the space and freedom of being in her own home. She claims that she could no longer “enjoy or feel safe in the flat”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Wife also exhibits footage of the Husband allegedly harassing her by “coming so close” to her personal boundaries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Again, the Wife says that the Husband’s actions constituted continual harassment as defined in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The video was played in court. It clearly shows the Husband seated next to the Wife on the couch. The Wife then stands up and moves to sit away from the Husband, putting their son in between them. In the process, a cushion was flung, presumably by the Wife, onto the seat that she had just vacated. The clip ends with the Husband kissing the son on the head.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     While the Wife may feel annoyed, frustrated, or angry at being in close physical proximity to the Husband, in my judgment, his actions do not constitute harassment. As the Husband had explained, he had joined the Wife and the son on the couch because it was their routine to watch television with their son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I find that the Husband’s actions were not calculated at “causing anguish” to the Wife, but rather, intended to give their son a sense of normalcy as far as possible by keeping up with their Sunday routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 2 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This incident occurred at 11.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Husband had tried to enter the Wife’s room multiple times on the pretext that he wanted to remove the remote control to the air conditioner. What he really wanted was to remove the CCTV that the Wife had installed in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     When the Wife saw the Husband heading towards the CCTV, she quickly pushed him out of the room. She tried to close the door. The Husband resisted and prevented her from doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     An argument ensued over the Wife’s use of the air conditioner in her room. In the course of this argument, the Husband suddenly came “very close” to the Wife and shouted in her face. The Wife says this was an act of aggression to intimidate her. She retaliated to demonstrate that she would not cower in the face of such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     During this time, the scuffle continued, with the Wife using her body to push against her bedroom door to prevent the Husband from entering her room. The Husband, however, forcefully pushed against the door, causing the Wife to fall “backwards on[to] [her] back”. The Wife’s head hit the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife subsequently obtained a medical report from the Accident and Emergency Department. It was exhibited in her affidavit. The primary diagnosis was a “sprain of shoulder”. The secondary diagnosis was a head injury.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife also claims that prior to this incident, both the Husband and his family had been very aggressive and had made several threats against her. Her case was that the Husband had, in this incident on 2 February 2024, caused hurt to her, and this was an act falling within limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having watched the video footage, which was also played several times in court, it is clear to me that the Husband did not commit family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The video shows both the Husband and the Wife tussling at the door. The Husband is trying to gain entry into the Wife’s room. The Wife, on the other hand, is barring his way and trying to push him back out into the corridor. As the Husband tries, once more, to force his way in, he does not appear to be using much force. The Wife tries to stop him. In the process, she loses her balance. Her knees buckle. She reaches out to grab onto something to arrest her fall. Her hand finds the Husband’s neck and arm. The Husband is also dragged down. He falls on top of her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     That the Wife fell down, and suffered an injury to her shoulder and head, was not, in my judgment, a result of the Husband shoving her forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife cites this incident as an example of how the Husband had escalated his “harassment and aggression” towards herself as well as her mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Wife alleges that that the Husband had placed his hand very close to her face, as well as that of her mother, under the “guise of making a video recording” of the both of them. She says that the Husband did so “in order to apply physical force” on the both of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In written submissions, the Wife clarifies that her reference to this incident was merely to “show that there was an escalation of tensions between the parties”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In any event, having reviewed the footage, I do not find that the Husband had intentionally placed his hand very close to the Wife’s face under the guise of making a video recording when his true intention was to apply physical force. Parties were, at the time, both filming each other, presumably so that they would both have evidence to present in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other allegations of family violence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged family violence, the Wife also raises a host of other acts of family violence which she says the Husband had committed on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     First, the Wife says that the Husband had harassed her by unlocking her room with the master key and entering without her permission or giving advance notice. This was in spite of her informing him that he needed to seek her permission before doing so given that the both of them were already living in separate rooms by that point. The Wife also says that she was, on several occasions, improperly attired when the Husband barged in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The second instance of such harassment the Wife cites was in relation to the Husband installing CCTV cameras around the flat. She says that this has led to her living in “fear and surveillance”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Apart from this, the Wife says that the Husband had intruded into her personal boundaries, planted an Apple Air Tag tracker on their son (see above at [x]), and threatened to ransack her room. Taken together, these were, according to the Wife, acts that constituted continuous harassment meant to cause her anguish.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Finally, the Wife accuses the Husband of abusing her mentally, and cites the following examples.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     For one, the Husband had taken away the remote control to the air conditioner, forcing her to endure “the heat with just a fan”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife also says the Husband had cut off her Wi-Fi. In addition to this, the Husband would, on or around July 2022, slam or bang on her door early in the morning simply because he was unhappy. When she opened the door, he would just stare at her and walk away. This apparently happened for a few months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Wife also accuses the Husband of threatening her in mandarin – he would tell her: “I will want to see how you eventually die without me”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Having already addressed the specific incidences of family violence which the Wife has raised, and found that the Husband’s actions in two of those incidents did constitute family violence (above at [16] and [32]), I do not think it necessary to deal with these other allegations the Wife has levelled against the Husband. Doing so would only run the risk of increasing the acrimony between the parties who are currently in the midst of divorce proceedings. I echo the views of the court in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Apart from s 65(1), <b>there are also good reasons why, in principle, a court should not be obliged to make findings as to whether family violence has been committed for every allegation raised by the parties</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>The purpose of a PPO is not to punish a party for past acts of such violence</b>: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him</em> at [10]; <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“<em>GFS</em>”) at [31]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]; <em>UMI v UMK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [37] to [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   Instead, a PPO is “pre-emptive” in purpose – i.e., it protects an applicant from future family violence. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is in danger of family violence, then a PPO should be issued even if such violence has not been committed on the applicant previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   Additionally, in the case of cross-complaints involving parties in a highly acrimonious relationship, <b>there is a real risk of the parties expecting the court to adjudicate on who was “right” or “wrong” regarding their past differences</b>. A PPO trial is not a forum to settle personal scores. There is little utility in expending court resources to scrutinise each allegation of family violence when it is already clear from the evidence or from a party’s conduct in court that he/she is ready to engage in escalatory “tit-for-tat” for the most minor slight perceived from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For completeness, however, I deal with the Wife’s argument that based on the incidents which took place on 28 November 2023 (above at [40]), 28 January 2024 (above at [44]), February 2024, 3 February 2024 (above at [33]), and the CCTVs installed in the home since 16 December 2024, it is clear that the Husband had committed family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I do not find that these incidents, when considered together, demonstrate that Husband had embarked on a campaign of harassment against the Wife. As I had explained above (at [38] – [39]), the Husband did have reasons for putting an air tag in the son’s bag, as well as going to sit next to the Wife on the couch. In any event, these alleged incidents took place during a time when parties’ relations were strained to the breaking point. The suspicion and mistrust that arose likely coloured the Wife’s view of these events, giving her the impression that the Husband was trying to harass her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Having found that the Husband had committed family violence (above at [16] – [32]), I turn now to consider the necessity of a PPO as well as a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The inquiry into whether a PPO is necessary involves a risk assessment as to the likelihood of a respondent committing family violence against an applicant in the future: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. This involves an examination of, <em>inter alia</em>, the reasons and circumstances for family violence and whether the family violence was a recent occurrence. Red flags that point to the necessity of a PPO include: a) likelihood of interactions between the parties; b) that the underlying cause for family violence remains unresolved; c) respondent specific factors (<em>ie</em>, where the respondent is deeply antagonistic towards the applicant or where the respondent has a propensity for violence): <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In addition, the necessity requirement also encapsulates an assessment of whether a PPO is necessary to <b><em>deter</em></b> family violence – as the court in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> had observed (at [23]), this is because a PPO essentially converts acts which are typically non-arrestable offences, into an arrestable offence. This is because the commission of such acts would be considered a breach of a PPO, and such a breach is an arrestable offence under s 65(11) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I would add that the PPO regime recognises that there will be, in any relationship, some degree of conflict, and that the actions of parties could conceivably fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in the Charter. However, it is only where this conflict rises to a point where intervention is warranted that a PPO will be granted to protect the applicant from harm and/or abuse. This finds expression in the “necessity” requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the circumstances, I find that it is necessary to grant a PPO, as well as a DEO to exclude the Husband from the Wife’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     It is clear to me that there was no love lost between the Husband and the Wife. The videos produced in court showed the intensity of their quarrels. There are also unresolved issues that provide the kindling for further conflict – for instance, the Husband’s suspicion that the Wife had been cheating on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     It is also not the case that both the Husband and the Wife are able to completely break off ties and go their own separate ways. They are still staying in the same house. Their close physical proximity to each other has, and can only continue to, create further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As to the necessity of a DEO, that stems from the fact that a number of the incidents here have arisen from the Husband’s attempt to enter the Wife’s room despite her having told him, on no uncertain terms, not to do so. The DEO is necessary to ensure that the Wife has her own undisturbed space within the house and to minimise the possibility of further conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Finally, I will also order that the PPO and DEO shall only be effective for a period of 2 years from the date of this judgment (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). This is because the divorce proceedings between parties would, in all likelihood, have concluded by then. After the ancillary matters have been resolved, parties would have embarked on their own separate paths. Contact may well be minimal, and limited to matters concerning their son. This would greatly reduce the opportunities and avenues for conflict that necessitate my granting of the PPO and the DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     In addition to the PPO and DEO, I am also ordering that both the Husband and Wife go for counselling to equip themselves with the necessary tools to better deal with and manage their conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband’s application in SS 218 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I turn now to consider the Husband’s application for a PPO and DEO in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 218</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Husband relies on the following incidents in support of his application for a PPO and a DEO against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 13 September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The first relates to an incident on 13 September 2023 at 11.55pm. This was what the Husband had said in his affidavit:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11.    The Respondent and I have quarrelled over her claim that my parents entered her room without her consent. She has also accused my parents of bringing “black magic”-related paraphernalia into her room. Her claims are obviously trivial, frivolous, and false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12.    She has clear anger management issues and has screamed at me and physically assaulted me by scratching my upper body which left visible scratch marks. After doing so, she called the police. When the police arrived and saw my scratches, he asked whether I would like to report abuse/violence. I had no intention of pursuing the matter back then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     In essence, the Husband’s complaint is that in this incident, the Wife had physically assaulted him by “scratching [his] upper body which left visible scratch marks”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In written submissions, the Husband had argued that because counsel for the Wife did not cross-examine the Husband on this point, it leads to the conclusion that she had accepted the Husband’s account of events.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife, on the other hand, argued in written submissions that the Husband’s account should not be accepted. This was because the Husband had not adduced any supporting documents. There was also an “abject lack of details” in the Husband’s AEIC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> And even taking the Husband’s case at its highest, the Wife’s actions could not constitute family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband’s argument, though it does not explicitly say so, urges me to apply the rule laid down in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 (“<em>Browne</em>”). As was noted in <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0855.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 855</a> at [17]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 <em>prima facie</em> applied. This rule stands for the well-settled proposition that (per Colin Tapper, <em>Cross and Tapper on Evidence</em> (Butterworths, 8th Ed, 1995) at p 319, which was cited in <em>Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 2 SLR(R) 0936.xml')\">[1999] 2 SLR(R) 936</a> at [48]; see also M N Howard et al, <em>Phipson on Evidence</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 1990) at para 12-13):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Any matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The rule in <em>Browne</em>, however, is not a “rigid, technical rule”. In the words of the court in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0292.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292</a> (cited with approval in <em>Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18816-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 944</a> at [115]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42    Before leaving the issue of oral evidence, I should comment briefly on the effect and relevance of what is referred to as the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67. <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is a case of some vintage and it lays down a rule of fairness. The effect of that rule is that where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission. It is not a rigid, technical rule. Nor is it necessarily satisfied by a formulaic recitation of a party’s case to a witness, with an invitation merely to agree or disagree. In <em>Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/47211-M.xml')\">[2005] 2 SLR 236</a> at [15], Choo Han Teck J noted that the rule which is derived from a case more than a century old must be applied with due regard to the realities of modern litigation and in evaluating any given objection, consideration should be given to the totality of the evidence in the case. I think that is correct. In <em>Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina</em> [2002] 1 SLR 408 the Court of Appeal noted (at [40]) that the rule is not rigid and does not require every point to be put to the witness but this would generally be required where the submission was “at the very heart of the matter”. This was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46445-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 4</a> at [49]–[50]. I approached the evidence and the submissions in this case in that light.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     That the Wife had not been cross-examined on this point does not necessarily mean that I am bound to accept the Husband’s version of events. Indeed, I do not. While the Husband has recounted this incident in his affidavit, he has not exhibited any documents to support his claim. For example, there are no pictures of the scratches which the Wife had allegedly inflicted. Further, given that the police had been called, one might expect that a police report or some other documentary evidence be exhibited, notwithstanding the fact that the Husband had stated he had “no intention of pursuing the matter back then”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I add that even accepting the Husband’s account, that the Wife had indeed scratched him, he has not established whether her actions amounted to family violence. That is because his account of events (above at [81]), does not set out fully the circumstances in which the Wife had scratched him. It also does not describe the extent and severity of the scratches allegedly inflicted upon him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Husband has therefore not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife had indeed committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The second is an incident which took place on 2 February 2024 at 11.30 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also relied on this incident in support of her application for a PPO in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The Husband’s account is that the Wife had returned to the matrimonial home and turned off the doorbell camera. When confronted by the Husband, the Wife admitted to doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Husband says that the Wife had turned off the doorbell camera out of spite and with the intention of provoking him. He says that she had done so several times previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     On this occasion, the Husband responded by informing the Wife that he would be turning off the CCTV she had installed in her room, as well as the air conditioner. He further informed her that she would have to bear part of the utilities expenses if she wanted to enjoy the comforts of air conditioning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     This sparked a quarrel. The Husband says that when the quarrel took place, he was standing outside her room and holding the door. The Wife insisted on pushing him out of the room, and in doing so, scratched him all over his body. The Husband was left with visible scratch marks. He exhibited photographs at Tab C of his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Amidst this scuffle, the Wife tried to retreat into her room. She lost her balance and fell to the ground. The Husband denies pushing her. He says that she had lost her balance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Having fallen down, the Wife began to “scream and cry loudly”. The Husband retreated from her room. He says that she was able to stand and walk around normally. The Husband went to the living room to wait for the police officers who arrived a few moments later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Husband’s case is that the Wife had caused hurt to him when she scratched him, and hit him on his neck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having watched the video, it was clear to me that there was a scuffle between the Wife and the Husband at the entrance to the Wife’s bedroom. The Husband was trying to force his way into the Wife’s bedroom, and she was trying to resist. The video shows the Husband feinting to his left, as though he was about to disengage from the scuffle, before suddenly twisting around and trying to barge past the Wife. The Wife managed to hold her ground, and it was in this context that she had struck his neck. In my judgment, the Wife’s actions do not constitute family violence within the definition of either limb (a) or (b) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     As to the scratches which the Husband had allegedly sustained, he was cross-examined at length on whether the video showed that the Wife had indeed inflicted these scratches on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> He was also cross-examined on the manner in which he had described these scratches in the police he had filed a day after the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    In my judgment, the Wife had indeed scratched the Husband during this scuffle. The Husband had produced pictures of scratch marks on his body, namely his shoulder and arm. It is also clear from the video that the Wife had indeed grabbed the Husband. Taken together, it is likely that the scratches the Husband sustained were indeed caused by the Wife during the scuffle. I also note that the Husband’s evidence, in his affidavit, that the pictures of the scratch marks on his body were indeed the injuries he had suffered in the altercation with the Wife, was never challenged in cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    That being said, I do not find that this falls within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (b). These were minor scratches. It cannot be said, from the pictures of these scratches the Husband had exhibited, that the Wife had indeed caused hurt to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Finally, I add that even if the Wife’s acts of hitting the Husband on the neck, and scratching him, were considered acts of family violence, the Wife is entitled to rely on the Self-Defence exception (see <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [10] – [13]). The video makes it clear the context in which the Wife had used such force on the Husband. She was trying to stop him from intruding into her personal space. She did not use excessive force in doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I come now to the incident on 27 December 2023. The Wife had also relied on this same incident to support her application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    The Husband’s case is that in this incident, the Wife had committed family violence because she had wrongfully confined or restrained him, together with their son, as well as his elderly parents against their will in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Husband appears to suggest that because he was never cross-examined on his account of events<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> – that the Wife had, by asking “her boyfriend and mother to hold the lift at the ground floor” and even pressed the alarm button – his account of events should be accepted and so he has proven that the Wife had wrongfully confined or restrained him in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Even accepting the Husband’s account, I do not think that the Wife’s actions fall within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (c) of s 64 of the Charter. As the court in <em>UEJ v UEK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20636-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 90</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> had noted (at [40]), the threshold for wrongful confinement or restraint is higher than a situation where a complainant’s movements were “somewhat restricted” by a respondent for a “certain duration”, and especially where such incidents had occurred in a public place and not in a private or restricted area.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Based on the Husband’s account, the Wife had merely tried to prevent him from taking the son back up to their flat. This had occurred in a public area amidst a quarrel between both the Husband and the Wife. Given the Wife’s actions and the circumstances in which she had so acted, I do not find that her actions had crossed into the realm of family violence in that it could be said that she had “wrongfully confined” or “restrained” the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The Wife had also cited this incident in support of her application for a PPO (above at [57]). In written submissions, the Husband further submitted that this incident would “better support his application for a [PPO] against the Wife”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband cites the fact that the Wife had “intentionally provoked him” in this incident by “video recording him”, “knocking multiple times on his room door” and “knocking on his mother’s room door” although she had already gone to bed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The Wife raises a preliminary objection. She says that the Husband should not be allowed to make a claim based on this incident. That is because this incident was never part of the Husband’s case, and so the Wife never had an opportunity to respond to the allegation which the Husband is now levelling at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    It is well-established that incidents which arise after an application for a PPO has been filed may be taken into account provided that the respondent: a) had not been taken by surprise, and b) had been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the evidence at the trial: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21(g)] citing <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [57] – [60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the present case, the Husband had not included this incident in his complaint form. There is also no account of it given in his affidavit. There was therefore nothing to which the Wife could respond. Given this, I will not take this incident into account in considering the Husband’s application in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Wife is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    As was noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16], there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence had been committed. It suffices to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence is likely to be committed against the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    An example of when the court has found that family violence is likely to be committed is the recent decision in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>. In that case, a video tendered to court showed that both the husband and wife in that case had knowingly harassed each other. The video showed both the husband and wife recording each other during their altercation whilst accusing each other of provocation. The court also found that there was “deep and long-standing animosity” between the both of them which was evident from the numerous police reports the both of them had filed, each accusing the other of having committed family violence (<em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [12] and [14]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    In the present case, I find that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband. On the evidence put before me, it was clear that the quarrels between both the Wife and the Husband were becoming increasingly heated. That was clear to me from the videos which showed how the Wife had responded in the incident on 11 December 2023, as opposed to how she had responded in the incident on 2 February and 20 April 2024. These videos show the Wife acting in an increasingly confrontational manner towards the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    I would add that the additional video which the Husband tendered, which showed a different angle of the incident on 20 April 2024, also showed that the Wife did provoke the Husband. The Wife did not object to this video being produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    That video shows the entirety of the quarrel between the Husband and the Wife on that day. The Husband had gone to the Wife’s room. He knocked on the door. When there was no response, he walked away and took off his shirt. He returned soon after and tried knocking on the Wife’s bedroom door again. After a few attempts, the door opened. The son ran out and into the Husband’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    The Wife, as well as her mother, came out of their bedroom. They went to knock on the Husband’s bedroom door. The Wife’s mother pulled out her handphone in an attempt to record the Husband’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Frustrated at being filmed, the Husband attempted to grab the handphone from the Wife’s mother. Witnessing this, the Wife goes and knocks on the Husband’s mother’s bedroom door. The argument escalates and the Husband’s mother is dragged into the ensuing argument. The Wife enters the room where the Husband’s mother had been sleeping in and begins shifting various objects out. I must add that unlike the Wife’s mother, who played an active role in the argument, the Husband’s mother can be seen attempting to restrain the Husband and to calm him down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The video clearly shows that the actions of both the Wife, as well as her mother, had only served to provoke the Husband and to escalate matters in that incident. The Wife also agreed, when it was put to her in cross-examination, that she had, by her actions in this incident, intentionally provoked the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    When considered in totality, the various video clips which parties had played in court showed an escalation in tensions and aggressions between the parties. The Wife clearly had a role to play in this escalating conflict. She chose to react in a manner that was not only confrontational, but also rather aggressive at times. The manner in which she reacted in all these incidents which were captured on video spoke to the likelihood of her committing family violence against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Having found that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband, it logically follows that a PPO is presumptively necessary to protect the Husband: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Leaving aside the presumption, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that it is indeed necessary to order a PPO. Parties are still living together in the same flat. They are currently undergoing divorce proceedings. It is also apparent to me that there is a great deal of animosity between them. Given that the both of them still continue to share the same space, it is likely that they will continue to interact and come into contact with each other. This will only provide ample fuel for further conflict (see also my findings above at [75]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    In the circumstances, the Husband’s application for a PPO is allowed. This PPO shall be valid for a period of 2 years (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). For the same reasons which I had set out above (at [77]), I find it appropriate, in this case, to limit the PPO to a period of 2 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    However, I do not find it necessary to allow the Husband’s application for a DEO to exclude the Wife from his bedroom. The evidence before me does not show that the Wife had attempted to set foot into the Husband’s bedroom. The Husband’s application for a DEO is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    To summarise, the Wife’s application for a PPO and DEO is allowed. I am also granting the Husband’s application for a PPO, but not for a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    Unless parties are able to agree, I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    Finally, I conclude with some brief remarks to both the Husband and the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I have made the relevant orders against the both of you. There are consequences if it is found that you have wilfully breached those orders: s 65(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Stop fighting. You have a young son. These are his formative years. Do not let his childhood be sullied by the bitterness of your quarrels. Focus on how the both of you can work together to give your son the best possible start in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Treat the counselling sessions seriously. They are meant to help you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    It remains for me to thank Mr Cha, Ms Yeo and Mr Leong for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\"

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Lynette Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was the Mother’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Father for herself and their three young children, [A] who is 4 years old and twins [B] and [C], who are 1 year old. The Mother also applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial flat where they resided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over 4 days. The Mother testified and called 5 witnesses - her father, 3 domestic helpers and her aunt. The Father testified and called 4 witnesses - his mother, his aunt and 2 friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Upon conclusion of the trial, I directed parties to file written submissions and reserved my judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Court will only grant a PPO if the following two requirements are fulfilled:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Family violence must have been committed, or there is a likelihood that family violence will be committed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The evidential standard of proof to be applied in PPO proceedings is that of the civil standard of “on a balance of probabilities”, and not the more stringent “beyond reasonable doubt” criminal standard of proof. However, the protection conferred by a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions. Pursuant to s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), a person who wilfully contravenes a PPO is guilty of a criminal offence and will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. In addition, a police officer who has reason to suspect that a person has wilfully contravened a PPO may arrest the person without a warrant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Given these criminal consequences, a PPO will not be lightly ordered<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, this is set out in s 64 of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Allegations of Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother’s case is that the Father had committed family violence against herself and the 3 children under all 4 limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In her opening statement, the Mother asserted that the Father had an unstable mental state, a violent disposition and was quick to anger by nature, and that even before the marriage, he had at times exhibited low mood, low self-esteem and was easily agitated. She also stated that he repeatedly acted in a verbally abusive, threatening and hostile matter towards her, especially from 2020 onwards. She asserted that over time, his unpredictable mood and frequent outbursts of anger towards her caused her to feel constant background anxiety when he was around her. She further asserted that after their eldest and then the twins were born, the Father’s abusive and violent behaviour also affected them<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In deciding this case, I considered whether family violence has been committed by the Father under the different limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(a) Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Under limb (a), it is important to bear in mind that the acts of the perpetrator will not constitute family violence unless he acted with an intention to place the victim in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the victim would, by the acts, be placed in fear of hurt. These are “subjective” states of mind in that the perpetrator must have the requisite intention or knowledge<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. For example, a perpetrator might express his frustration in the presence of the victim. This act alone, without the requisite intention or knowledge, will not constitute family violence even though such expression may be inappropriate and ill-advised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<em>UNQ</em>”), a mother applied for a PPO on behalf of her children against their father. She alleged, among other things, that the father had thrown things around the house including a metal coffee mug. The father denied these allegations. The Family Division of the High Court held that the act of the father in throwing a metal coffee mug could amount to family violence if there was evidence that the children were standing in the direction where the mug was flung. The Court found that the act of the father, even if true, was at worst inappropriate but did not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will now consider the incidents relied on by the Mother to mount her case that the Father had committed family violence by wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place her and the children in fear of hurt:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Mother alleged that on or around 9 August 2016, shortly after parties were married, parties had an argument and the Father shouted at the Mother and tried to pin her to a cabinet. The Mother alleged that he caused her hurt and pain and bruised the back of her hand<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father’s version was that the Mother had raised her hand and tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away out of reflex to ensure that the Mother would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with her arm<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As this was the Mother’s application, she had to prove that the incident occurred in the manner she alleged. I find that the Father’s account of the incident was more credible than that of the Mother’s and I accepted the Father’s evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. I also note that there was no contemporaneous evidence such as a police report or a medical memo that the incident occurred in the manner alleged by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Furthermore, this was an isolated incident that occurred back in 2016. No other incidents are alleged to have occurred between 2016 and 2020, and the parties continued to live together, with no evidence that the Mother had been put in fear of hurt as a result of this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On balance, I do not accept that the Mother has proven that Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother next relied on an incident that occurred four years later in 2020, when she became pregnant with [A]. The Mother explained that [A] was conceived by way of intra-uterine insemination (“IUI”) and she underwent multiple IUI attempts in 2019 involving numerous hormonal injections over multiple months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother stated that she suffered from frequent bleeding and was hospitalised due to threatened abortion in her first trimester and threatened premature labour in her second and third trimesters. It is the Mother’s case that the Father had frequent outbursts and would yell at her when he visited her at the hospital. He had also said that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage. She stated that as she “feared for the safety of (herself) and the yet-unborn (child)” she moved into her parents’ home to live with them after she was discharged from the hospital. She also continued to stay with her parents after she was discharged a second time from a government hospital in July 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father denied her allegations. He stated in his affidavit that the Mother was in and out of hospitals frequently due to her difficult pregnancy. He denied telling the Mother that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage and stated instead that he had told her that in the event of a difficult birth, he would much rather she live instead of the unborn child. He stated that the parties had disagreements on whether the Mother should transfer from a private hospital to a government hospital. He further stated that the Mother needed 2 daily injections at a clinic near her parents’ home and decided it would be best for her to live at her parents’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     During cross-examination, while the Mother maintained that she moved into her parents’ place because she feared for the safety of herself and the unborn child in April 2020 after her first discharge from hospital, she was unable to identify any specific incident of alleged violence committed by the Father before April 2020 other than the incident in August 2016. On the stand, she conceded that to the best of her memory she was unable to recall<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. When probed further if she could identify any other incident of violence stated in her affidavit before April 2020, she did not refer to any specific incident but instead referred to paragraph 51 of her affidavit where she had stated generally that throughout her pregnancy, the Father would have frequent violent outbursts and shouted at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s alleged outbursts and shouts at the Mother will not constitute family violence unless he had the requisite “subjective” state of mind, in the sense that he must have had the intention or knowledge to place or attempt to place her in fear of hurt. The authorities are clear that a mere expression of frustration by the perpetrator in the presence of the victim made without any such intention or knowledge will not in itself constitute family violence even if such expression may be inappropriate and ill advised<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. On the whole, I do not accept that the Father’ outbursts and shouts, even if accepted, would amount to him wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place the Mother in fear or hurt. I will also add that the documents relied on by the Mother did not assist her in proving that she had been in fear of hurt due to the father’s actions. She had exhibited an inpatient discharge summary from a private hospital dated 13 April 2020, stating that she had been admitted since 20 February 2020 for “threatened abortion”, an inpatient discharge summary from SGH dated 14 July 2020 where she had been diagnosed for “threatened premature labor” and another inpatient discharge summary dated 2 August 2020 where she had been diagnosed with “premature or threatened labor”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. She further exhibited a memo from the Women’s Mental Wellness, KKH dated 28 August 2020 that stated that her stress levels were very high<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. None of these documents prove that the Mother’s medical conditions were caused by any specific act of family violence committed by the Father. They certainly did not show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incident in or around July 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother stated in her affidavit that the Father had come to her parents’ house where she was living after her second discharge from hospital to visit her. Both of them got into a disagreement on the preparations for the baby’s arrival and the Father shouted at her using vulgarities. The Mother alleged that he hit the wall and the bedframe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Father’s version was that the Mother had given him a number of tasks to prepare for the arrival of the baby. He had not completed all of them and the Mother made remarks such as “you’re not ready to be a father?” and “how can I trust you if you can’t even get these simple things done”. He stated that he swore in frustration at the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In my judgment, the Father’s alleged act of shouting at the Mother with vulgarities and his actions of hitting the wall and the bedframe, even if true, was at worst inappropriate and ill-advised. There was no evidence to show that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by the acts be placed in fear of hurt, for example if there was evidence that he had aimed his punch in the direction of the Mother and had hit the wall and the bedframe instead. I am unable to conclude that the Father’s actions constituted family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident on or around 23 August 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The next incident cited by the Mother occurred when the Mother and her parents went to the parties’ matrimonial flat where the Father was living alone to pick up some clothes. Prior to that, the Mother’s parents had ordered a baby’s cot to be shipped there and the Mother had asked the Father to assemble the cot as the Mother had hoped the both of them could live together after the baby was born. While there, the Mother found that the place was in a mess and the baby’s cot was only partially assembled and a disagreement arose between the parties. The Mother alleged that the Father shouted that she was accusing him of being a bad father, even though she had not done so, and that he yelled at her and her father to get out of the house and shouted vulgarities. He also threw the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Father’s version was that he was living alone in the matrimonial flat. The Mother and her parents arrived and started berating him and finding fault with him and the state that the house was in for at least an hour before he raised his voice and told them to stop shouting at him. He denied that he had touched anyone or made any gesture that he would hit or use physical violence against anyone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     On the facts, I do not find that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. The Mother’s allegation was that he had thrown the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists. It was not her case that he had thrown the baby’s items at her or that he had aimed a punch in her direction and hit the wall instead. At all times, the Mother was free to leave the matrimonial flat and disengage from the disagreement if she had truly been in fear of hurt. Furthermore, even if the Mother had indeed been in fear of hurt, I was unable to conclude from the evidence that the Father had the requisite mental element.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">5. Incident in or around December 2020 after [A] was born</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     After [A] was born, the Father moved into the home of the Mother’s parents. The Mother stated that she wanted to keep the family intact and was reassured that her parents would be physically present if things got out of hand. The Mother stated that the Father appeared to be unhealthily obsessed with [A], and “whenever someone (like me) tended to [A], (he) would get disproportionately upset…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father denied that he had behaved in a threatening manner. He explained that his requests for permission to spend time with [A] were met with unjustified ridicule, scolding and doubts from the Mother and her parents. He felt that this was humiliating and even when he requested to take [A] downstairs around the block to walk, this request would be rejected or they would say he needed to be accompanied by the helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In or around December 2020, the Mother alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father then shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid the Father. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. Her fear was exacerbated because she had claustrophobia which she had told the Father about before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother stated that she eventually managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Mother’s father gave evidence that he and his wife rushed home upon receiving the Mother’s call. He asked the Mother if the Father had beat her, and the Mother responded that she was afraid that the Father would have hurt her physically if her parents had not come home as soon as they could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father denied these allegations. He stated that the Mother was in a bad mood that day as he had accidentally left the fridge door open in the morning. This upset the Mother as she said that the breast milk could spoil and could kill [A] if he drank it. She commented that the Father was a danger to the baby and that the baby he would die in his care. The Father stated he had apologised profusely to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father stated that he had asked the Mother if he could spend time with [A]. Three hours after the Mother had been in the room with [A], he went in to check in on them. He denied that he had tried to snatch [A] from the Mother. He explained that when the Mother started accusing him, he did not want to leave the room for fear that the Mother was suffering from post-partum depression. His version was that the Mother pushed and punched him and dug her fingers into his arms before she called her parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. He exhibited undated photographs of injuries he claimed to have sustained on his arm. He also exhibited contemporaneous WhatsApp messages he had exchanged with his friend that day to support his version of what had transpired<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Since this is the Mother’s application for a PPO, she has to prove that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place her in fear of hurt. I have considered the evidence available before the Court and I am unable to find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. It was her case that the Father wanted access to [A], but she refused as she did not want [A] to be disturbed from his sleep. What ensued thereafter was a disagreement between parties as to who would get to spend time with [A]. Even on the Mother’s own evidence, there are no allegations of actions by the Father that could be construed to be placing or attempting to place her in fear of hurt. I did not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Father had acted with the necessary intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by his acts be placed in fear of hurt. His actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">6. Incident on or around 12 February 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother stated that during Chinese New Year, the parties were at the home of the Mother’s relative. The parties had planned to go for dinner at the Father’s parents’ home after that. The Mother had told the Father before they went to her relative’s home that they would only be able to leave for his parents’ home after she had finished breastfeeding [A] to avoid disrupting his feeding schedule. The Mother stated that at that time, the Father had agreed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Mother stated that while she was breastfeeding [A] in her cousin’s room, the Father came into the room and demanded that they leave for his parents’ home as they were late for dinner. She reminded him that they had agreed to leave only after [A] had finished breastfeeding. The Father began to shout and demand they leave immediately. She was shaken and in fear and called her parents over the phone. Her father came into the room and asked what happened. The Mother explained that she needed more time to feed [A], and her father told the Father to call his parents to explain that they would be late and the Father stomped out of the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Mother’s father gave evidence in his affidavit that he also left the room after the Father left and when they were outside the room, he told the Father to be more reasonable to give the Mother more time to tend to [A]’s needs. The Father became angry and started to raise his voice and banged his fists on the wall and furniture<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     After the Mother finished breastfeeding [A], parties left the relative’s place and the Mother alleged that the Father drove in a dangerous manner to his parents’ place, weaving in and out of traffic even though the Mother and [A] were in the car, and she feared for their safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father’s account was that parties were almost 2 hours late for dinner with his parents. He was frustrated that the Mother did not want to leave her relative’s home. He stated that he had hit a soft cushion on the chair but he denied punching the furniture or the wall of the relative’s home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, even if the Father had punched the furniture and the wall (which was denied by the Father), that could not amount to wilfully or knowingly placing the Mother in fear of hurt since it was not done in her presence but only after the Father had left the room she was in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, I do not accept that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. I will also add that despite the alleged concerns of the Mother’s relatives, all of them, including her father, had allowed the Mother to leave with the Father for his parents’ place. The Mother’s relative also confirmed at the trial that she called the Mother to ask if she had reached the Father’s parents’ place safely and the Mother confirmed this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7. Incident in or around May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It is the Mother’s case that after a couples counselling session, the Father shouted at her during the car ride back. The impact of him shouting at her was exacerbated by her claustrophobia as she was trapped in the same space as the Father who was driving the car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father’s case was that the Mother started accusing the Father of not informing the counsellors about an incident that took place on 8 May 2021 and the parties had a disagreement where he was upset with the Mother. The Mother requested to be dropped off near her home and he dropped her off.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On the facts, I found that a disagreement arose between the parties while the Father was driving the vehicle and this led to the Mother being dropped off the car at her request. I do not find that there was any evidence to support the Mother’s contention that she had been in fear of hurt or that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">8. Incident on or around 6 June 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother claims that the Father had shouted at her for about an hour at her parents’ home and harassed her to move out of her parents’ home. Her parents tried to intervene and the Father shouted at them to get out of the room and continued shouting at the Mother inside the room. The Father then went on a hunger strike and refused to eat, knowing that this would cause the Mother anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father stated that he was merely discussing the matter of moving out of the home of the Mother’s parents. He denied going on a hunger strike to cause distress to the Mother and explained it was because he lost his appetite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my judgement, even if the shouting and the alleged hunger strike had occurred, I do not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. In addition, there was no evidence to show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt. The Mother was clearly free to refuse to move out of her parents’ home without any consequences, which was in fact what happened on 8 June 2021, when the Mother did not join the Father when he moved out of the home of the Mother’s parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">9. Incident in or around August 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     More than a year later, in or around August 2022, the Mother stated that after parties attended a marriage workshop, the Father shouted at her in public for not being a good wife and called her a “bad wife” and a “bully”. She was afraid of being near him and walked away. Parties eventually went home separately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father explained that the Mother had raised an unresolved issue from the marriage workshop, insisted that she had “reached the end of the road for this marriage” and it was she who started raising her voice at the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I do not find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. There was no evidence of any physical threat. The Mother’s own evidence was that she “walked away from (the Father) to distance (herself) from (his) shouting and public humiliation of (her)” and proceeded to “(take) the MRT back to” her parents’ home. I accept the Father’s submissions that at all material times, she was free to and did in fact disengage and leave the Father by taking public transportation to her parents’ home. I did not accept that the Mother had shown that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed her in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">10. Incidents from 7 June 2023 to 12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties went overseas in June 2023. The trip comprised 8 people: the couple, [A], the helper, the Mother’s parents, a pastor who was also a friend of the Mother’s father and the pastor’s wife. The Mother’s brother had committed suicide overseas a few years before that and the family were there to commemorate his death anniversary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     By this time, the Mother was expecting twins. [A] was then 2 years and 9 months old. The Mother asserted that during the trip, the Father would shout at [A] whenever he was “tired or emotionally dysregulated”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She listed the following 4 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">7 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Mother alleged that on 7 June 2023, while parties were in a maxicab to their Airbnb accommodation, [A] was tired as he had not slept well on the plane and was being fussy in the maxicab. The Father shouted at him to stop and threatened to beat [A]. He also threatened to leave [A] in the maxicab.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">9 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother alleged that on 9 June 2023, parties were at a playground when [A] became hungry and tired. Parties walked to a shopping street to have lunch and [A] was behaving in an unsettled manner and crying. The Mother asked the Father to carry [A] so that she could order food, but [A] did not want the Father to carry him and made a fuss. The Father pinned [A’s] arms down and forcefully carried him away from the café. The Mother asked the helper [E] to go check on [A] and after a while, [E] returned and said she was unable to make [A] calm down. The Mother left the cafe to look for the Father and [A]. She could hear [A] crying and the Father yelling and threatening to abandon [A] in the shopping street.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">10 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Mother alleged that on 10 June 2023, all 9 of them were in a maxicab, heading to a columbarium outside the city. [A] was tired and started to cry. The Father shouted at [A] saying that he would have the maxicab driver take him away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">11 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Mother alleged that on 11 June 2023, as their flight back to Singapore was very late, around 11 pm, [A] was tired as it was past his bedtime. He was also restless and hungry and started to run around the airport and at times, he would get upset and cry and yell. In response, the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave him behind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Mother’s own evidence, at its highest, is that the Father shouted and threatened [A] when [A] was tired, fussy or crying while they were overseas. In my view, while the Father may not have acted in the most exemplary manner when dealing with a tired toddler who was crying and fussing on an overseas trip, I do not accept that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11. Incident in or around August 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother gave birth to twins, [B] and [C] on 14 August 2023. She alleged that shortly after she returned to her parents’ home, the Father shouted at her and demanded that she pack up all her things to move to their own matrimonial flat. In her closing submissions, she submitted that she was put in fear and felt compelled to move to their matrimonial flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Father’s evidence is that he spoke firmly to the Mother and the Mother eventually agreed to move to their matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I found it hard to accept the Mother’s submissions that she was in fear of hurt, nor was there any evidence of threat beyond that of a quarrel. This contradicted her own evidence in her affidavit that she moved to live with the Father as she was “hoping to give the marriage another chance for the children’s sake, especially the twins”. She had also stated that she “had no choice but to move into the (residence) with (the Father) as there was no space at her (parents’ flat) for the twins”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. I rejected her claim that she was in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">12. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The helper, [E], engaged to care for [A], stated in her affidavit that sometime in September 2023, she was at the matrimonial flat with [A] as it was a weekend. [E] alleged that [A] woke up during his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying, but [A] did not stop crying. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg, causing him to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. [A] had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E]’s evidence was that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and [A] instead started hitting the Father. The Father told [A] to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I accept the Father’s account of the incident. Apart from [E], no other witnesses, including the Mother herself, gave evidence on this incident in their affidavits. According to [E], [A] was having difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed, and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly and it was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]. Yet despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. I also note that the Mother herself has given no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, if it had indeed transpired as [E] described, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case. On balance, I preferred the Father’s account of what occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     This incident was also only mentioned in [E]’s affidavit. According to [E], the Father, [A] and herself were on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby of the matrimonial flat as the Mother was breastfeeding [B] and they wanted to keep [A] away from the Mother. [A] was crying because he wanted to be with the Mother. [E] alleged that the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block, which was the highest floor of the block. [E]’s evidence was that [A] cried, then suddenly became unnaturally quiet. [E] alleged that after this incident, [A] became very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, saying, “I don’t want, I don’t want. Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father disputed [E]’s account entirely. He stated that he was unable to recall such an incident as he had never threatened to leave [A] at the highest floor of the block. He asserted that it was the helpers and the Mother’s parents who used this threat when [A] lived with them on weekdays. He did not know if anyone had actually taken [A] to the top floor of the matrimonial flat before. He stated that [E] herself had also jokingly threatened to take [A] to the top floor if he misbehaved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I preferred the Father’s evidence over [E]’s. I found it difficult to accept that a toddler would have the concept of the 17<sup>th</sup> floor as the highest floor and become very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, to the extent that he would say specifically “Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button” after only 1 incident when he was threatened on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby, which was on a completely different floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In any event, even if the Father had threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block (which I did not accept), I do not see how this caused [A] to be in fear of hurt. I also do not see how the Father could be said to have wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">14. Incident on or around 17 March 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Mother exhibited an audio recording of the Father shouting at [A] in the car and threatening to beat him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The Father explained that this recording was taken 3 weeks after the Father stopped talking with the Mother and her parents. He wanted to go to church that day as he needed to pray. Before parties got into the car, [A] started claiming that he did not want the Father to go to church with them. The Father ignored this. Inside the car, [A] sat on the Mother’s lap in the front passenger seat and was holding a portable fan. [A] started hitting the Father with the portable fan while saying, “I don’t like dada, I hate dada”. The Father told him to stop being rude. [A] did not stop even after he was told by the Father to stop thrice. The Father took the portable fan away from [A] and told him that he was going to discipline him. The Father maintained that he did not hit [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The transcript of the recording showed that after the Father told [A] to “stop beating people already”, [A] stated “Later I beat you Dada. I beat”. When the Father stated, “You want me to take out the cane?”, [A’s] response was “Go Away”. In fact, [A] tells the Father 3 times to “Go away”. On the whole, I did not find that the Father’s actions were anything out of the ordinary in the normal disciplining of a child. I reject the proposition that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">15. Incident on or around 4 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Mother stated that [A] was with them at the matrimonial flat as it was a weekend. The Mother suspected that the Father had contracted Covid-19 and asked him not to go too close to the twins especially since they were born premature, making them more susceptible to illness than their peers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     [A] was helping to feed [C] in the playpen but the Father wanted to feed [C] instead. The Mother reminded the Father not to go too near [C] as the Father was unwell. The Father shouted at the Mother that she was preventing him from having access to [C]. He also shouted at [A], saying it was unfair that [A] who was sick could feed [C], when he could not. The Mother stated that [A] then cowered in fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Subsequently, the Mother, [A] and [E] (the helper who looked after [A]) went out. When they returned around 4 pm, the Father approached [A] who did not want to speak to the Father. The Father got angry and started to scold [A] for having “shit values” and that he was brought up by the Mother and her parents to be hateful. The Mother asked [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room to be away from the Father. She then carried [B] to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. The Father continued to yell at her and accused her of telling everyone that he was crazy and not a good father. He berated her for not being a good mother. She started to video record him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Father submitted that the video recording submitted by the Mother showed that he walked away from the Mother right after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I do not accept that the Mother or [A] was in fear of hurt. There is no evidence that the Father threatened any act of physical violence. At all times, the Mother was fully in the position to intervene and disengage, as when she told [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room. She was also able to go out with [A] in the afternoon. She also went freely to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. I also did not find that the Father had the necessary intent to place or attempt to place her or [A] in fear of hurt. He walked away from the Mother after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">16. Incident on or around 9 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The Mother’s version was that her mother was at the matrimonial flat that afternoon to care for the twins and her mother had a scuffle with the Father’s mother who had also come by to the matrimonial flat. The Mother rushed home from work and then texted their marriage counsellor [Y]. Subsequently, the Mother heard objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives. He also slammed the door of the study room. She went upstairs to investigate and heard the Father shouting while he was talking with [Y] over the phone. The Mother overheard that he was shouting “cunt”, “motherfucker”, “hateful” and “go to hell”. She deduced that [Y] must have called the Father after receiving the Mother’s text message. She captured an audio recording of the Father taken from the outside the study room shouting while he was on the phone with [Y].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Shortly after, the Father opened the door of the study room and saw the Mother standing in the hallway of the second floor. He came very close to her, pointed threateningly at her and shouted at her. She started recording his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The helper who looked after [B] came up the stairs and took [B] whom the Mother was carrying. The Father turned away from the Mother and walked away and the Mother took the chance to go to the first floor. She then called the police and while waiting for the police to arrive, locked herself, the twins [B] and [C] and the 2 helpers who looked after [B] and [C] in a room. The Mother submitted a copy of a memo from her psychologist dated 10 May 2024, whom she had been visiting since August 2017 for “mental health support due to stress and emotional trauma<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father submitted that the recordings did not show that he had sworn at the Mother or that he had directed his outburst at her. He submitted that the Mother’s psychologist was not called as a witness. More importantly, the psychologist’s memo dated 10 May 2024 did not state that family violence had been committed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On the whole, even if the events had occurred as alleged by the Mother, I do not accept that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. If she was indeed fearful after hearing objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives and slamming the door of the study room on the second floor, it is unlikely that she would choose to walk upstairs to investigate and try to hear and audio record what the Father was saying in his conversation with [Y] behind closed doors. I accepted the Father’s submission that there was also no evidence that he had wilfully or knowingly placed the Mother or the children in fear of hurt. He was expressing his frustrations in the study room with the door closed when he was speaking to [Y] over the phone. The audio recording also showed that the Father was addressing [Y] and saying that “he did not want to fight (the Mother)” and that he “will not beat her and he will not touch her”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. I also note that the Mother had admitted at the trial that she had actually not seen the psychologist whose memo she exhibited dated 10 May 2024 on both the material dates of 9 and 10 May 2024. Her psychologist had also not met the Father as well<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. There was also nothing in the memo that supported the Mother’s contention that family violence had been committed on 9 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17. Incident on or around 22 and 23 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The Mother alleged that sometime in the middle of the night, [C] woke up and began to cry. Both the Mother and the Father went downstairs where the helper who looked after her was patting her to sleep. The Father kept asking the helper to pass [C] to him but the helper did not want to. The Father accused the Mother of instructing the helper not to hand [C] to him. He then stomped away. The Mother went back upstairs to her room to sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Mother alleged that shortly after, she was lying in bed when the Father barged in and shouted at her and accused her of preventing him from having access to [C]. She hid under her blanket and remained silent. After shouting for a while, the Father left the room. She then locked the door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The next morning, while the Mother was getting ready for work, the Father continued to accuse her of preventing him from carrying the twins. She called the police as she was concerned the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him in an attempt to deter his abusive behaviour. Instead, the Father got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Before the Mother left the house, she wanted to carry [B] for a while to say goodbye. The Father who was sitting in [B]’s playpen and carrying [B] refused and asked the Mother why she needed to carry [B] and stop the Father from spending time with [B]. She told him she was not stopping the Father from spending time with [B] and she just wanted to carry [B] for a short while. She then entered the playpen to take [B] out and carried him while the Father followed her around the residence and accused him of not letting him have [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     After the Mother put [B] down and left him in his helper’s care, she went to the main door of the residence to leave for work when the Father berated her from a distance, again accusing her of not letting him have [B]. He then approached her threateningly while she was at the main door. The Mother said she feared for her safety and went towards a “safety room” where the helpers of [B] and [C] were and tried to close the door. However, the Father stuck his arm into the opening of the doorway and shouted that the Mother could not lock herself, the 2 helpers and the twins in the room as that would deny him access to the twins. He then struck the door of the room with his arm that was in the opening of the door multiple times and threatened her that he would tell the police that she had hurt him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After a while, the Father removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. At the same time, the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Father disputed the Mother’s allegation that he had grabbed her arm and shook her while she was trying to film him. He also disputed that the room was a “safety room” and alleged that the Mother would always take the children into the room when she wanted to deny him access to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     After considering the evidence, I did not find that family violence had been committed. Despite having the CCTVs in the matrimonial flat, and having her phone recording on, the only recording submitted by the Mother of the Father allegedly shaking her violently was only 5 seconds long and did not show the Father shaking her violently<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The recording also showed that the Father did not raise his voice at her. In any event, I will add that even if the Father had grabbed the Mother’s arm and shook her, this action did not cause the Mother to be in fear of hurt. The Mother’s own evidence was that shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in and carrying [B] in as she wanted to spend time with [B]. If she was truly in fear of hurt, it was inexplicable that she would dare to approach the Father who was sitting in the playpen with [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     For completeness, I will add that the Mother’s evidence was that even before the police arrived, the Father had removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. Again, if the Mother was truly in fear of being hurt, it really did not make sense that she would allow [C] and the helper to leave as surely [C]’s need to be fed could wait till the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">18. Incident on 25 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Mother alleged that on 25 May 2024, a Saturday, the Father wanted to take [C] out to a picnic with his friends. The Mother did not agree that he should take [C] out on his own without the support of the helpers. The Father threatened to take [C] out of the residence and to the picnic and also threatened to stop her from taking [A] out for his activities if she did not allow the Father to bring [C] out for the picnic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     The Mother was afraid that the Father would go through with his threat of stopping her from taking [A] out and called the police for assistance. The Father learnt that she had called the police and followed the Mother from the living room to the main door where she was waiting for the police. He accused her of denying him access to the children and said that if she did not let him have the children, he would not allow her to have the children and threatened to have Child Protection Services take the children away. When the policemen arrived, they spent a substantial amount of time in the Father’s room. Subsequently one of the policemen called the Mother to the room and spoke to both of them together. The Mother made a police report regarding the incident. As she was afraid for both her and the children’s safety, she asked her mother to stay with them until the following Monday 27 May 2024 when she applied for PPOs for herself and the 3 children as well as a DEO in respect of the entire matrimonial residence. On 27 May 2024, an Expedited Order was granted to restrain the Father from committing family violence against the Mother and [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Father denied the Mother’s assertions that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, what transpired was that a disagreement broke out after the Mother refused to allow the Father to take [C] out to a picnic. I did not see how this could have caused the Mother or the children to be in fear of hurt. I also did not see how the Father could have the necessary intent to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">19. Incident on 1 June 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The Mother alleged that she had returned to the matrimonial flat after bringing [A] to his art class. The Father was carrying [B] in the living room while she was in the kitchen. Suddenly, the Father blurted out without any provocation, “Daddy doesn’t want to be around hateful people. Such hateful people with hateful values”. She alleged that the Father handled [B] roughly while putting him down in the playpen, causing [B] to cry. The Mother alleged that the Father did not even bother to soothe [B] and simply walked away and shouted at the Mother, “Get out of my face and out of my life”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. The Father then went upstairs and slammed the door of the study room<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In the Mother’s closing submissions, she stated that she had been in the kitchen at that time, away from the Father and had not spoken to the Father nor done anything to him before this outburst. She submitted that “it is clear that the Father is volatile and unstable. He can suddenly lose control of his temper and flare up over nothing, putting the subject of his anger in danger”. She submitted that the Father’s handling of [B] in his agitated state suggested that when the Father is angry or agitated around [B], [B] would likely to be hurt or put in fear of hurt by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having viewed the video recording and examined the transcript<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, I am not convinced that the Father had put [B] down in the playpen in a rough manner as alleged by the Mother. The area in the living room where the playpen was is not large. I accepted the Father’s explanation that he put [B] down as he wanted to leave the living room so as to not to engage further with the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     The Mother’s own evidence showed that she was not in fear of harm. She had originally been in the kitchen, away from the Father. I failed to see how she could have been in fear since after she heard the Father blurting out that he did not want to be around hateful people, she then voluntarily chose to come out of the kitchen to the living room where the Father was with [B] before the Father then said, “Get out of my face and get out of my life”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">20. Incident on 27 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Mother alleged that he had questioned the helpers in a threatening manner multiple times throughout the day after having read their affidavits. The Mother alleged that he hurled insults and expletives at her including “big liar”, “lying bitch”, “lying scum” and “vile human being”. She alleged that the Father “was standing in close proximity to (the Mother) and pointing and gesturing at (the Mother) while he insulted her. He could have hurt her physically if she had responded or retaliated to (his) tirade”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    The Mother further alleged that the Father had also involved his own mother and aunt to take [C] out of the home that afternoon despite the Mother’s objections. She submitted that “by taking [C] out of the home in the context of his threatening behaviour towards (the Mother) and the helpers that day… (he) was demonstrating that he, as the aggressor and as head of the household had control and dominance over the (Mother) and the children. After parties’ affidavits were exchanged, (he) felt the need to re-exert control over the Mother and the children”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The Father denied that family violence was committed. I accepted his submissions. Although the Mother submitted multiple recordings, text messages and a police report regarding the 27 July 2024 incident, none of the evidence showed that the Father had made any threat of hurt to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. I also note that it was the Mother who walked into the kitchen when the Father was talking to the helper. If the Mother was in fear of the Father, it defies logic that she would voluntarily walk into the kitchen and be in the Father’s way. The video also shows that the time period where the Father had interacted with the Mother in the kitchen only lasted for 40 seconds<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    For all the reasons stated above, I find that the Mother has not proven her case under limb (a) in that she has not shown that the Father had willingly or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother or any of the children in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(b) Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Physically abusing a family member constitutes family violence under limb (b). There are, however, two types of force which are exempted from the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used in self-defence and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age (“the Correction Exception”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Mother relied on 2 incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to her and 2 other incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to [A]. I will consider the incidents in turn:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    As stated in paragraph 13 above, the Mother had alleged that the Father had pinned her hand to a cabinet and bruised her hand sometime in August 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I had accepted the Father’s version of what transpired in paragraph 15 above, that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away so that she would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with the Mother’s arm. His evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination at the trial<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> was consistent that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him. There was no police report or medical evidence to the contrary. I accepted the Father’s evidence that he had acted in self-defence and I reject the Mother’s claim that the Father had committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident on or around 22-23 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The only other incident where the Mother alleged that actual physical hurt was caused to her is stated in paragraph 85 above. The Mother alleged that she had called the police as she was concerned that the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him. The Father instead got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently, causing pain and soreness to her arm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    I had found above in paragraph 90 that the video recording of the Father allegedly shaking the Mother was only 5 seconds long and did not show that he was shaking her violently. The Mother also did not produce any medical reports to show that she had suffered any injury or pain on her arm. Her own evidence did not suggest that she had suffered any injury, since shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in with [B] and ask the Father to pass [B] to her so that she could carry [B] to say goodbye before she left for work. In my judgment, the Father’s actions were in response to the Mother calling the police and taking out her phone to record him and I do not accept that actual physical hurt was caused to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incidents from 7 June 2023-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    The next 2 incidents concerned [A]. The first incident occurred just after parties had taken the maxicab from the airport and arrived at their Airbnb accommodation. The only person who gave evidence that the Father had beat [A] was [E], the helper who looked after [A]. [E]’s evidence was that after they got off the maxicab, the Mother passed [A] to her parents to take care of him as the Mother was feeling very tired from carrying [A] throughout the whole flight from Singapore. [A] could not stop crying as he wanted to stick with the Mother and the Father took [A] from the Mother’s parents and “forcefully hit his buttocks and legs multiple times to stop him from crying”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    [E]’s account directly contradicted the Mother’s account of what transpired. The Mother’s evidence was that it was her father who brought [A] to his own adjacent Airbnb apartment and after a while, when her father managed to soothe [A], he brought [A] back to the Mother and the Father’s Airbnb apartment but when [A] saw the Father, [A] started crying again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    This alleged incident of physical hurt to [A] was also completely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father who was allegedly the one the Father took [A] from. If the Father had indeed taken [A] from the Mother’s father and then hit [A] forcefully on his buttocks and legs multiple times according to [E]’s account, it was puzzling why this important event was not mentioned at all in the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    On the whole, I found it difficult to accept [E]’s account that the Father had taken [A] from the Mother’s parents and hit him as it contradicted the Mother’s own account of what had transpired and it was entirely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    For completeness, I will add, that even if the Father had used physical force on [A] (which I did not accept), I would have gone on to consider if this fell within the Correction Exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    While there is, as the Family Court observed in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> (“<em>VYB</em>”) at [11], growing suggestion internationally that physical punishment produces detrimental consequences in children, the Correction Exception remains part of Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    If indeed the Father had spanked [A] as claimed by [E], I am of the view that it could fall within the Correction Exception if it was done for the purpose of teaching discipline with a measure of good sense, in a judicious and responsible manner, and for the benefit of the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. It was not in dispute that [A] was tired and had not slept well on the plane and had cried throughout the maxicab ride to the Airbnb. The Mother was very tired from carrying [A] throughout the flight and needed to rest, yet [A] still wanted to remain with the Mother. In my judgment, the Father’s correction of [A] in these circumstances would not have constituted family violence. The common law, which continues to underpin legal regulation of the relationship between parent and child in Singapore, has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline on the chid, including some degree of physical punishment as long as it is a reasonable one. In <em>VYB</em>, the Court identified at [14] - [15], several related factors that shed light on the reasonableness of the physical punishment by a parent of a child. These include the reasons for the punishment, the nature of the punishment, and the age and personal characteristics of the child. I am of the view that the Father’s spanking of [A] on his butt and legs was not unreasonable considering the circumstances: that the Mother needed to rest after the flight but [A] was still crying and wanting to stick to her. I will also add that even if this incident of spanking could be considered harsh for a young child, consistent with the observations in <em>TCV (On behalf of Child, A) v TCU</em> [2015] SGFC at [14], the law does not intervene through the issuance of a PPO in every instance of parenting that exceeds the Correction Exception and a PPO will not be granted unless it is necessary for the protection of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    This was the only other incident in the Mother’s closing submissions where it was alleged that actual physical hurt had been caused to [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    As stated in paragraph 63 above, [E] had alleged that [A] woke up from his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying but he would not stop. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg. [E]’s evidence was that this caused [A] to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. He had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E] stated that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and instead started hitting him. The Father told him to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop bearing [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    I had accepted the Father’s account of the incident as stated at paragraph 65 above. As I have stated, despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. The Mother herself also gave no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    I will also state that I do not find that the Father’s method of discipline towards [A] was overly excessive such that it crossed the boundaries set by the Correction Exception and amounted to family violence as defined in the Charter. There is also no evidence that this correction was for the Father’s own “gratification of passion” or “rage”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> as submitted by the Mother, and I do not accept her submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had caused hurt to her and/or [A] under limb (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(c) Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    The Mother also relied on limb (c) to state that when the Father had stood at the doorway when the Father stood at the doorway and blocked her from leaving the room with [A] in or around December 2020, he had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    As per paragraph 31 above, the Mother had alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid him. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. The Mother stated that eventually she managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    I had found earlier at paragraph 36 that it was the Mother’s actions of carrying [A], who was the subject of the disagreement, and trying to leave the room that led to the escalation of the situation. The Father’s actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give. I do not find that the Mother was confined or restrained in her room. In fact, it was her own evidence that she managed to leave the room with [A] and that she got past the Father. In my view, the Mother could easily have left [A] who was sleeping in the room and left at any point since it was access to [A] that the Father sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will under limb (c).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(d) Continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    The Mother also alleged that the Father had continually harassed her and the children under limb (d). The Mother submitted that the Father’s harassing behaviour towards and the children was repeated across multiple incidents such that they constituted prolonged, persistent or sustained conduct, and even if each incident in and of itself may not be sufficient to warrant a PPO being granted, taken together, they showed a persistent course of conduct on the Father’s part to alarm and distress the Mother whenever he was upset or angry, which has caused severe and repeated anguish to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    The Mother also submitted that the Father continually harassed her with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause her anguish in the following 3 incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    The Mother alleged that sometime during her pregnancy in 2020, the Father had demanded a divorce and told ger that it would be better if she had a miscarriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    The Mother alleged that the Father threatened to forcefully bring [A] out for a picnic with his friend despite her disagreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 27 July 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    The Mother alleged that after the Father had seen her and her witnesses’ AEICs, he threatened her to “watch out” and this caused her to feel afraid and threatened by his words.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    The Mother submitted that the Father continually harassed [A] with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause him anguish in the following incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incidents from 7-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    The Mother alleged that during their overseas trip, the Father threatened [A] as follows: on 7 June 2023 when [A] could not stop crying, the Father threatened to beat him and leave him behind. On 9 June 2023 when the Father threatened to abandon [A] in the shopping street and let passers-by take [A] away when [A] would not stop crying. On 10 June 2023, when the Father threatened [A] that the maxicab driver would take him away if he did not stop crying and on 11 June 2023, when the Father threatened to leave [A] behind when he was tired and fussy at the airport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    The Mother submitted that in or around October or November 2023, the Father threatened to leave [A] at the top floor of the matrimonial flat when [A] cried when he was insecure being away from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    The Mother alleged that the Father insisted on bringing [C] to a picnic and kept shouting at the Mother who was then carrying [A] saying “Why cannot bring [C] out’. To keep [A] safe, the Mother handed [A] to his helper who brought [A] to his room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shouting/using vulgarities and slurs/insults in a hostile manner</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Towards the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    The Mother submitted in the closing submissions that the Father had caused her continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting her and relied on 15 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. She highlighted that the Husband had apologised for the incident on or around 23 August 2020, where he had used vulgar language on her and her parents, showing that he knew such behaviour would cause distress to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Towards [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    The Mother submitted that the Father had caused [A] continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting him, or shouting in his presence during 8 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Towards the Twins</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    The Mother relied on 6 incidents of the Father’s behaviour of shouting in the presence of one or both of the twins when the Father was shouting to submit that he was likely to cause or have caused continual harassment. She further stated that “considering (his) pattern of behaviour, especially how he has treated [A] who is now 4 years old, it does not require a leap of logic to see that (the Father) would also be behaving in the same hostile and harassing manner to [B] and [C], if such behaviour goes unchecked”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Hitting or throwing things/pointing aggressively/cornering or following around aggressively/intruding into a safe space</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    The Mother further submitted that the Father had caused continual harassment through 3 incidents of hitting or throwing things in the incidents in or around July 2020, 23 August 2020 and 12 February 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    She also alleged that the Father had caused her continual harassment by pointing at her aggressively during 3 incidents, namely on or around 4 May 2024, 9 May 2024 and 27 July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    Furthermore, she submitted that the Father cornered her or followed her around aggressively in 4 incidents, in or around December 2020, 9 May 2024, 22 and 23 May 2024 and 25 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    The Mother also submitted that the Father had intruded into her safe space twice during the incidents on or around 22 and 23 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    There is no legislative definition for the term, “harassment”, as it is used in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. We must therefore look to the cases which have interpreted the term “harassment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    The case of <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> (“<em>Yue Tock Him</em>”) is instructive. The District Court ruled that “harassment” means: “a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance of another person”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    Further, the conduct that is said to constitute “harassment” must be “continual” to constitute “family violence” – a single act of harassment does not, in itself, constitute “family violence”. Following from this, “not all unpleasant or annoying behaviour between two family members will, by itself, be considered as “family violence”. Only sufficiently serious and grave conduct, which are continual and sufficiently repetitive will meet the requirement (see <em>WDR v WDQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27586-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 46</a> and <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    These requirements may, at first glance, appear rather stringent to a victim of family violence. However, as the District Court explained in <em>Yue Tock Him</em>, it is necessary that the law protects against frivolous complaints that make an issue of the most trivial of matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    None of the incidents either on their own, or in totality, involve serious threat of harm to the Mother or the children. They may fairly be characterised as loud and antagonistic disagreements. However, it would be inappropriate for the Court to rule that such incidents constitute family violence, without more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    I would also add that while the Mother cited incidents spanning from 2020 to July 2024, there are clearly several breaks in continuity between the incidents. The 21 incidents that she cited as constituting harassment occurred across more than 6 years. 1 incident occurred in 2016, 4 occurred in 2020, 3 in 2021, 1 in 2022, 4 in 2023 and 7 in 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. I do not find that this demonstrated a repetitive and sustained pattern of behaviour which warranted the grant of a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    While the Father’s conduct may not have met the highest standards of husbandhood, on the totality of the incidents alleged by the Mother, even taken at its highest, I do not find that there was sufficiently serious and grave conduct by the Father, which was continual and sufficiently repetitive as to constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Necessary for the protection of a family member</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    I have found above that the Mother had not shown that family violence had not been committed under any of the limbs (a) to (d). For completeness, I will go on to state that I would also not have found that the Mother had satisfied the second limb of S 65(1) of the Women’s Charter, that it was necessary on the facts to grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a PPO is not granted. This is because a PPO is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if it is unlikely that there will be family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (<em>Yue</em>, at [64]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    Further, as the Family Court explained in <em>WLP v WLQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29626-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 10</a> at [15], the concept of “necessity” implies that there must be a measure of effectiveness to the end sought. An order that is ineffective in addressing family violence will be “extraneous to and hardly necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant”. In other words, this statutorily prescribed requirement of necessity serves as a safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the Court in family matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    The only 2 incidents cited by the Mother that allegedly involved physical harm occurred in August 2016 and then 8 years later in May 2024. I have found on the facts that no such physical harm occurred to her. All the other allegations concerned verbal disagreements that, while undoubtedly uncomfortable, do not amount to family violence. No serious incidents of physical violence or persistent harassment have been proved by the Mother. Accordingly, the granting of a PPO is not necessary in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    Specifically with regards to the children, there is currently no court order for custody, care and control and access of the children. That being the case, the Court will also be loath to intervene to issue a PPO when this may indirectly restrict or hamper the Father’s access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    It is evident that the arrival of the children to the family unit has placed tremendous strain on the Mother. She had explained in her affidavit that all their children were conceived by way of IUI and she had undergone multiple IUI attempts in 2019 and 2022 where she received more than 1,000 hormonal injections over multiple months. The Mother stated that having gone through so much just to conceive the children, their welfare was her utmost priority. The twins were born pre-mature and she was especially concerned about their physical health. She listed the sacrifices she had made for their children, such as breastfeeding [A] until he was 2 years old despite working full-time and then subsequently breastfeeding [B] and [C] until they were 8 months old, continuing to pump milk every 3 hours for the twins’ dietary needs. She also extended her maternity leave and went on part-time and flexi-work arrangements to care for the children. She also employed 2 helpers to help with caring for each of the twins. In addition, there is a third helper who cares for [A] who has stayed with the Mother’s parents since he was born, coming over to the matrimonial flat only on weekends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. I would urge the Father to seriously reflect on his behaviour and consider what made the Mother pursue this application against him. Although her application for a PPO has failed, this should not be construed as a victory for him. He should learn to control his temper and exercise more patience and care towards the Mother, failing which it may be that a PPO may be granted if the conflict between the parties does escalate in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    It is not uncommon that new parents of young children face considerable issues adapting to their new roles, and that disputes over different parenting styles and expectations may arise. It is evident that both parents love their children dearly. I encourage the Mother to accept as much help as she can from the Father in parenting the children and the Father to exercise much patience and care towards the Mother. Both the Mother and Father have a long journey of parenting ahead of them, a journey that can be both challenging and rewarding. The children are young and require all the love and support from both the Father and the Mother and I hope that they can do the best that they can for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Domestic Exclusion Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    The Mother had applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial home where they resided. As I have dismissed the Mother’s application for the PPOs, I will also dismiss her application for the DEO.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

They had a son and a daughter, who were born in February 2011 and in March 2012 respectively. By 2018, the marriage had fallen apart. In December 2021, these divorce proceedings were commenced. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in May 2022 on the ground that each spouse had behaved in a manner that made it intolerable for the other to continue to live with him or her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Despite the differences that led to this divorce, the spouses continued to co-parent their children. They agreed to share the custody of the children. They also agreed that the wife was to have care and control of the children and that the husband was to have access to the children each week, on public holidays and other special occasions, and during the children’s school vacations. This cooperation between the spouses was heartening, and these arrangements recorded in order of court dated August 2022 that was made with the consent of the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the spouses on the remaining ancillary matters, which were the division of the matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the wife and the children. I divided the matrimonial assets 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband. I also ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200 and the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife is dissatisfied with my decisions on the division of the matrimonial assets other than the matrimonial home and on the maintenance for the children. I now provide my reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32465-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 34</a> at [43], the division of matrimonial assets implicates a 4-stage process. First, the identification of the matrimonial assets. Second, the valuation of those matrimonial assets. Third, the determination of the contributions of the spouses to the acquisition of those matrimonial assets. Fourth, the fair apportionment of the matrimonial assets between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Identification and valuation of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I began by identifying and valuing the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in joint names</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matrimonial home was the only asset that the spouses held jointly. The wife is not challenging my decision on the division of the matrimonial home and is challenging on my decision on the division of the other assets. Still, for completeness, and because I had examined all the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home globally), I set out my decision on it briefly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The value of the matrimonial home as a matrimonial asset was the difference in the market price of the matrimonial home and the outstanding amount on the loan that had been taken for the purchase of the matrimonial home. The wife submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $889,000. The husband submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $819,000. In the absence of better evidence on the market value of the matrimonial home and given the relatively small difference between the values put forward by the parties, I took the middle of these two values (<em>ie</em>, $854,000) as the market value of the matrimonial home. The spouses agreed that the outstanding loan on the matrimonial home was $415,736. Accordingly, the value of the matrimonial home in the pool of matrimonial assets was therefore $479,124.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in name of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I set out the assets in the name of the wife and the values that each spouse ascribed to each of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"61.26%\"><col width=\"19.36%\"><col width=\"19.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Central Provident Fund Balances</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">UOB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">POSB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tencent (400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Xiaomi (3,400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Monies Withdrawn</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">148,625</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Sub-Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>64,899</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>213,524</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The spouses agreed that the wife had Central Provident Fund balances of $29,739, a UOB Bank Account with $6,262, a POSB Bank Account with $1,954, 400 Tencent shares with a value of $21,080, and 3,400 Xiaomi shares with a value of $5,864. All these items and their corresponding values were thus included in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     But the spouses took different views on monies amounting to $148,625 that the wife had withdrawn between January 2019 and September 2022 from her UOB Bank Account and her POSB Bank Account. The wife did not dispute that she had withdrawn these monies but explained that she had spent the monies on the household. The husband disagreed and submitted that these monies should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets that fell to be divided between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence of the wife, the marriage had broken down by 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The withdrawals, which took place between 2019 and 2022, had been made after the marriage had broken down. Once a marriage had broken down, any substantial sum expended by a spouse other than for daily or run-of-the-mill expenses had to be returned to the asset pool if the monies would otherwise have been matrimonial assets and the other spouse had not consented to the expenditure. Regardless of whether the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate the monies, or for the benefit of children or relatives, the spouse who made the expenditure had to be prepared to bear it personally and in full (see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31318-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 11</a> at [43] and [49] citing <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was therefore incumbent on the wife to account for the $148,625 as run-of-the-mill expenses and/or show that the husband had consented to the expenditures in question (see <em>WJG v WJH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29111-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 28</a> at [29(c)]). Beyond bare assertions that the monies had been spent on the family, however, the wife offered little explanation for the expenditure. Although it was unsurprising that objective or documentary evidence may not have been available to bear out every expenditure in a family, the absence of such evidence to support even the larger withdrawals cast doubt on the credibility of explanations of the wife for the withdrawals as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I set out the notable withdrawals for which the objective evidence did not bear out and/or sat inconsistently with the claims of the wife on them:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife withdrew $15,000 between February and March 2020 and suggested that she had done so to support herself and the children when they moved out of the matrimonial home after the marriage had broken down. But neither the wife nor the children did in fact move out of the matrimonial home, and they continued to reside in the matrimonial home even at the time of these proceedings. Further, it was not in dispute that the husband had supported the family and paid for the outgoings of the household during the marriage, even after the wife had purported to move out of the matrimonial home. This left little need for the wife to withdraw monies to support herself and the children over and beyond that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The wife withdrew $16,000 in April 2022 and suggested that she had much of these monies had been spent on course fees of $19,227 for a master’s degree for herself. But these course fees had been paid in two tranches – of $8,471 and $10,756 – with the latter due only in November 2022. And the wife offered no explanation for why she had made a withdrawal in April 2022 to meet course fees that were due over six months thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife withdrew $20,000 in July 2022 to repay a loan from one “Texas Lee”. But there was no documentary evidence in support of any liability by the wife to pay such a sum. This absence of documentation of the liability was particularly surprising given the relatively large quantum of this expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The wife withdrew $13,000 in December 2021, and $12,485 across July and August 2022 and claimed that part of the monies went to paying her legal expenses, ostensibly for these divorce proceedings. But legal fees for divorce proceedings should in principle be paid out of the payor’s share of the matrimonial assets and not the pool of matrimonial assets in general (see <em>WUA v WUB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31018-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 10</a> at [8]). Such expenditures had to be added back to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Adding the $148,625 that the wife had withdrawn after the marriage had

husband were not in dispute, whether as to the identity of the assets or the value of the assets. The only assets over which the spouses diverged were 475 shares in Meta Platforms, Inc, a time deposit account in OCBC Bank that the husband held jointly with his mother, and the proceeds of the sale of shares in a business called “[PB]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The spouses agreed that 475 Meta shares in the name of the husband were matrimonial assets. But they diverged over the date at which those shares were to be valued. The wife submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, when these shares were worth $309,415. The husband submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the interim judgment in May 2022, when these shares were worth only $76,090. In <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> (“<em>VQF</em>”) at [1], the Family Division of the High Court observed that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets, save for money account balances, was the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, because that date would facilitate the use of the most up-to-date values in ascertaining the economic fruits of the marriage. The husband asserted that the four-fold increase in the value of the Meta shares should accrue solely to him because it was his decision to hold the shares beyond the date of the interim judgment that produced the increase in the value of the shares. But there was little evidence to show, as of the date of the interim judgment, that the husband was assuming solely for himself rather than for the matrimonial pool the consequences of holding the Meta shares beyond that date. Without such evidence, there was little reason to depart from the position in <em>VQF</em>. The date for valuing the 475 Meta shares was thus the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. At that date, these shares had a value of $309,415.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It was also not in dispute that there was a time deposit with OCBC Bank in the names of the husband and his mother that had a monetary balance of $134,800. The wife submitted that this value was to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband, however, claimed that he had made no contributions to and had no beneficial interest in this time deposit or the monies therein. In support of this claim, the husband adduced an affidavit deposed by his mother in which she repeated the claim of the husband. But the husband as a joint owner of the bank account was entitled to the undivided whole of the monies in that account. On the face of his legal ownership of the account, the monies therein were matrimonial assets. Insofar as the husband asserted that he had no beneficial interest in the account, it was incumbent on him to obtain a determination from the civil courts to that effect because the Family Justice Courts were unable to adjudicate on a claim by a third party to a putative matrimonial asset (see <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]). But there was no such determination before me. Beyond the bare and self-serving assertions of the husband and his mother, there was no evidence to show that, despite the legal interest of the husband in that account, he had no beneficial interest in the monies in that account. I thus included that account in the pool of matrimonial assets and valued it at $134,800.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It finally appeared that the husband had received approximately $20,000 from the [PB] business. He had received this sum in two tranches, which were a fortnight apart, in September 2021, which was shortly before these divorce proceedings were commenced in December 2021. Scant explanation was offered to account for these monies. In my view, these monies were matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Adding the values of the Meta shares ($309,415), the OCBC Time Deposit ($134,800), and the proceeds of the sale of the [PB] business shares ($20,000) to the other assets in the name of the husband, the total value of the assets in the name of the husband was $927,175.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on my findings above, the pool of matrimonial assets comprised $479,124 in assets in the joint names of the spouses, $213,524 in assets in the sole name of the wife, and $927,175 in assets in the sole name of the husband. The value of the pool of matrimonial assets thus totalled $1,619,825.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The exercise of dividing matrimonial assets sought to fairly apportion the economic fruits of the marriage between the spouses by duly recognising their breadwinning and homemaking contributions to the marriage, in line with the philosophy that marriage was an equal partnership (see <em>TNL</em> at [45]). Two different approaches applied based on the nature of the breadwinning and homemaking arrangements in the marriage. In general, the “structured” approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a> (<em>“ANJ</em>”) was used, whereunder the court ascertained ratios representing: (a) the spouses’ direct contributions to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets; and (b) the spouses’ indirect contributions to the welfare of the family. These two ratios would then be averaged and necessary adjustments to the weightage of each ratio could be made to reach a fair and just division of the matrimonial assets. But the <em>ANJ</em> approach would not be applied in long single-income marriages because it over-recognised the financial contributions of the breadwinner and under-recognised the non-financial contributions of the homemaker. Instead, the division exercise in such circumstances tended to centre on the indirect contributions of the homemaking spouse, and the weight to be ascribed to these indirect contributions would be broadly proportional to the length of the marriage. Hence, the final ratios of division ranged from 50:50 (in long single-income marriages of 25–35 years’ duration) to 75:25 in favour of the breadwinner (in shorter single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (“<em>BOR</em>”) at [111]–[113] were instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">111    … In <em>TNL v TNK</em>, this court observed that the trend in long single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but different considerations may attach to short single-income marriages (at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <em>TNL v TNK</em> itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112    The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <em>TNL v TNK</em>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">113    We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <em>ATT v ATS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0859.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 859</a> at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <em>UGG v UGH (m.w.)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 25</a>, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <em>ABX v ABY and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0969.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 969</a>, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nevertheless, as the Family Division of the High Court cautioned in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a>, a litigant could not focus excessively on categorising a marriage as one that was single-income or dual-income. Rather, the court was ultimately guided by the philosophy that a marriage was an equal partnership, and equal and sufficient recognition had to be paid to both breadwinning and homemaking contributions. The power of dividing matrimonial assets would therefore be exercised in broad strokes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This caution was apposite in these proceedings, where the wife had worked periodically for a total duration of approximately a year within the 11-year marriage. At the time of these proceedings, too, the wife was actively looking for employment and had found employment by the conclusion of these proceedings. Still, the wife submitted that the <em>TNL</em> approach for long single-income marriages should apply,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that she should be awarded 50% of the matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> But given the relatively short duration of the marriage, one year of work by the wife was not insubstantial. This marriage therefore did not fit squarely within the <em>TNL</em> framework for long single-income marriages. The structured approach in <em>ANJ</em> was thus, by default, the appropriate one to take.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The husband, who was a breadwinner throughout the marriage, paid for the matrimonial home that had a value of $479,124 and the matrimonial assets in his name that had a value of $927,175. The wife, who worked for a year during the marriage, financed the matrimonial assets in her name that had a value of $213,524. The ratio of the direct contributions of the spouses was thus 87:13 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For the indirect contributions of the spouses, the marriage had lasted 11 years and the wife had been the primary caregiver to the two children throughout the marriage. The husband, who was the primary breadwinner, travelled regularly for work. Yet he paid the expenses of the household, oversaw the acquisition and fitting out of the matrimonial home, and engaged domestic helpers to assist the wife with her homemaking. As the husband submitted, these indirect contributions of his helped the wife with her homemaking and freed her to obtain educational qualifications including a diploma and a master’s degree, as well as pursue full-time jobs (albeit for limited periods of time). On balance, a fair apportionment of the indirect contributions of the spouses was 60:40 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Fair and equitable division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Taking the average of the ratios of the direct and indirect contributions of the spouses, the final ratio was 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The wife urged me to award her at least a 5% uplift in this final ratio by drawing an adverse inference against the husband for a lack of full and frank disclosure of his assets. She claimed that he had provide piecemeal responses to her applications for discovery and interrogatories and had been less than candied on his transactions especially in relation to his OCBC Time Deposit and his investment in the [PB] business. But the disclosure provided by the husband in discovery and interrogatories, even if occasionally piecemeal, was generally complete. Further, it was more principled, given that the values of the OCBC Time Deposit and the proceeds from the [PB] business shares were known, to add those values to the pool of matrimonial assets rather than to provide an impressionistic uplift to the final ratio of division in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I thus awarded the wife a 36.5% share of the $1,619,825 pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, if this marriage were classified, as submitted by the wife, as a single-income marriage, the approach in <em>TNL</em> would apply. Thereunder, given the 11-year length of the marriage, the wife would likely have received 25-30% of the pool of matrimonial assets. This would have been less favourable for the wife than the 36.5% share of the pool of matrimonial assets that she would receive pursuant to the structured approach in <em>ANJ</em>. But given that the purpose of the <em>TNL</em> approach (as an exception to the default <em>ANJ</em> approach) was to provide due recognition to the homemaking contributions in single-income marriages, it would be justified to grant the wife, who was the primary homemaker here, the more generous of the awards under the TNL approach and the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Accordingly, I awarded her 36.5% of the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the time of these proceedings, the husband and the wife were each approximately 50 years of age. The husband earned a monthly income of $10,737. The wife earned a monthly income of $3,500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For wife maintenance, the wife had earned a monthly income of $6,600 before the divorce, had lost that employment thereafter, and had found work only during the hearing of the ancillary matters at a monthly income of $3,500. It was commendable that the wife had made efforts to find such gainful employment, because the law encouraged former wives to seek employment to defray their personal expenses and contribute to preserve their pre-divorce lifestyles and standards of living (see <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5771-M.xml')\">[1995] SGHC 23</a> at [21]–[22] and <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [13]). Still, the difference between the monthly income of the wife before and after the divorce was substantial. It was thus just to have the husband contribute to the reasonable expenses of the wife while she found her feet after the divorce. Taking account of the not insubstantial share of the matrimonial assets that the wife would receive, I ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For child maintenance, the wife sought a monthly sum of $3,250 for each child and asked that the husband further “bear the children’s mandatory education expense including school fees, school trips and any extra lessons and/or programs organized by the school”. She added that the maintenance should be payable until the children complete their tertiary education and attain their first tertiary degree.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The husband proposed monthly figures of child maintenance of $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     At the outset, I found it unjustified at this juncture to have the husband maintain the children beyond the age of 21 years, which was the age upon which child maintenance obligations terminate unless otherwise ordered by the court (see s 69(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). The children were 13 and 11 years of age respectively. There was no certainty that they would be pursuing education beyond 21 years of age. As the Family Court in <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> observed at [10]–[12], maintenance catered to present and certain financial needs and not potential or uncertain aspirational wants. Absent certainty that the children would be pursing tertiary education, it would be unjustified to order maintenance to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the quantum of maintenance, the wife offered no breakdown for how each child spent $3,250 per month. Instead, she tabulated a detailed list of what she called “nocturnal activities” on the part of the husband then demanded that he put up $6,500 each month for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She appeared to premise her claim for $3,250 per child per month on the basis that the husband should be fully responsible for maintaining the children because he had a higher earning capacity than her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The husband, on his part, likewise offered few specifics on the expenses of each child beyond asserting that $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter comprised 62% of the reasonable expenses of each of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Based on the submissions of the spouses, the following expenses of the children were not in dispute:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Student care: $245 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School transport: $123 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Pocket money: $160 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Over and above these sums, the wife justified her claims for child maintenance on the basis that the children attended tuition and incurred expenditures on “daily living necessities such as food and grocery expenses, transportation costs, personal care, clothing and other miscellaneous needs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> For tuition, in particular, the wife submitted that the son incurred $1,434 each month while the daughter incurred $450 each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As between the submissions of the husband and the wife on child maintenance, I found the submissions of the husband more credible. Even as neither spouse provided detailed breakdowns of the expenses of each child, the submissions of the wife were more difficult to accept for three reasons. First, she claimed that the reasonable expenses of each child were the same when, on her own calculations, the son spent approximately $1,000 more than the daughter on tuition each month and the other expenses of each child were broadly similar. Second, on the calculations of the wife, the daughter would be spending over $2,000 each month just on food and groceries, clothing, and other miscellaneous needs, which estimate was objectively high. Third, the wife appeared to premise her claim for child maintenance on the basis that the husband should maintain the children solely when the maintenance of children is a joint parental responsibility and she was not without earning capacity. Indeed, at the time of these proceedings, the wife was seeking work at the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I thus preferred the estimates of the husband as to the reasonable expenses of the children and his proposals to pay $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter each month. The maintenance of the children was a joint parental responsibility, and the wife was not without financial resources to play her part in discharging that responsibility given the not insignificant amount of matrimonial assets that she would receive as well as the employment income that she had recently secured. Still, the wife would, even when she secured employment, require some time to settle into a breadwinning role after serving as a homemaker for much of the marriage. I thus ordered the husband to maintain the children in amounts that were slightly higher than those that he had put forward. The husband was thus to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I thus made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of, was to be divided in the proportions of 62.5% to the husband and 36.5% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband was to maintain the wife in the monthly sum of $200 for two years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband was to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I made no order on the costs of these proceedings.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>2WAOM at [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [39]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [56]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE 25/10/24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [85]–[89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [72]</p></div></content></root>"}]
