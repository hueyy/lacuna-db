On 20 November 2025, I released part of my decision affecting the sharing of the year end school vacation which was due to begin on 22 November 2025. The rest of my decision is set out at <b>Annex E</b> and on 28 November 2025, parties appeared before me to make submissions on the issue of costs and to fix the hearing date for MSS xxxx of 2024.

In this regard, sections 118 and 119 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provide as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>“Power of court to vary orders for maintenance</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>118.</em></b>      <em>The court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance… on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made … where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Power of court to vary agreements for maintenance</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>119.</em></b>      <em>Subject to section 116, the court may at any time and from time to time vary the terms of any agreement as to maintenance made between Father and wife … where it is satisfied that there has been any material change in the circumstances and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any such agreement.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Section 127 of the Women’s Charter further provides that Parts 8 and 9 of the Women’s Charter apply, with the necessary modifications, to a maintenance order for children made pursuant to divorce proceedings. This requires the Court to consider the following two provisions under Part 8 relating to spousal and child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       First, section 72(1) gives the Court the power to vary or rescind any maintenance order, provides further elucidation for the test for variation as set out in s118:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Rescission and variation of order</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>72.</em></b>—(1)     <em>On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and </em> <b><em>on proof of a change in the circumstances</em></b> <em> of that person, his wife or child, or for </em> <b><em>other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</em></b> <em>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit. [Emphasis added]</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>2</em>)     <em>Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Next, section 73 emphasises that any variation of child maintenance must be reasonable and must be in the welfare of the child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Power of court to vary agreement for maintenance of child</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>73.</em></b>      <em>The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child … notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">B.   THE LAW (VARIATION OF CHILD ORDERS)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”) provides that variations can be made to custody and care and control orders made by agreement or by order. I was of the view that the principles under both sections applied since the consent orders were made by agreements and by the order of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Section 128</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misinterpretation or mistake or fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Section 129</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the custody, or the care and control, of a child, regardless when the agreement was made, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Cases addressing the reversal of care and control have also stated the following principles:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The material change must be determined from the point the original orders were made, and the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration that has to be taken into account – <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0156.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 156</a>, [10] and [11].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A principled and pragmatic approach that considers the welfare of a child should be adopted in determining whether a material change in circumstances has occurred and the Charter s128 should not be read too narrowly. Relationships between parents and children are dynamic and the Court should also have sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances facing the child. However, this should not encourage parties to pursue a variation of orders at the earliest opportunity and the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangement work – <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a>, [15] and [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The power of the Court to a consent order under the Charter s129 should also be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances. Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties and the court would be slow to re-write their contract. If consent orders could be lightly changed, one party could lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to vary the agreement when the bargain was not to their liking – <em>VWQ v VWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a>, [9]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent – <em>ABW v ABV</em> (2014) 2 SLR 769, [29]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I am also mindful of comments made in <em>TSH v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20719-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 21</a> about the concept of the welfare of the child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That all facts in the case must be considered [74].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That there is no pre-fixed hierarchy of facts or considerations [74].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The analysis of the child’s welfare must begin by identifying the child’s needs. Once these needs are identified, the court must then consider whether those contending for responsibility over care of the child will be able to meet them [76].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Closely connected to their ability to discharge their responsibility of care is their relationship with the child, the desirability of the child maintaining a good relationship with parents to the best extent possible and the impact upon the child of any changes envisaged for the child [76].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">C.   GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Before I address the applications, I would like to make some observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     There have been considerable developments in the child’s life since the order had been made (at age 2) and last varied in June 2022 (at age 5) when he was in kindergarten. By the time of the hearing in 28 October 2025, the child had already started his first year of formal schooling in primary school (age 7) and he will be due to start his second year of primary school in 2026, which is about one month away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, the Father’s regular schedule with the child under the order has largely remained unchanged since the order was made, save that in <em>VPN</em> 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On October 2021 I ordered each party to be responsible for sending the Child to preschool/childcare and picking him up during their time with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Upon appeal on 10 June 2022, the parties were ordered by the High Court to share half the school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     So even leaving aside the parties’ own allegations against each other, it is time for Order to be updated so that the parties’ time spent with the Child can better support his growth in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">D.   WHETHER TO REVERSE CARE AND CONTROL TO THE FATHER/ CONSEQUENTIAL ACCESS ORDERS/ PROHIBITION ON PARENTAL ALIENATION/ PENAL NOTICE </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     First, I deal with the Father’s application in FSUM931 to reverse care and control (paragraph 4) and consequentially his prayers for access (paragraph 5). As the allegations in his application are also connected to prayers sought on prohibition against parental alienation i.e. communications with third parties in an educational context and with the Child (paragraph 2) and the requirement for a penal notice to be inserted in the order specifically against the Mother (paragraph 9), my findings of fact on this point will also determine my decision on these other prayers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father’s intention to file FSUM931 was communicated to me at a case conference on 17 March 2025. At this point, the hearing for the Father’s Committal Application had concluded (on 12 March 2025) and parties were awaiting the decision of the judge. The Father explained that in this variation, he would be relying on facts that had emerged during the hearing of the Committal Application. He eventually filed FSUM931 to reverse care and control on 28 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In FSUM931, the Father alleged that the Mother had breached the joint custody order, preventing him from being involved with the Child as well as depriving him of access. These allegations were mostly unfounded and based on an incorrect understanding of the law on custody and care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   The Law on Custody Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I summarize below the law on the relationship between Custody and Care and Control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In <em>CX v CY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (“<b><em>CX v CY</em></b>”), the Court of Appeal held that custody concerns the long term decision making for the welfare of the child, while care and control concerns the day to day decision making for the child [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Some examples of Custody decisions referred to in <em>CX v CY</em> include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The type of education the child shall receive [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The school that the child should go to [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The tutors that a child shall have [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Major healthcare issues [35]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Religion [35]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Some examples of Care and Control decisions referred to in <em>CX v CY</em> include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     How a child should dress [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     How a child should travel to school [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     What sport he should take up [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Which musical instrument he should play [33]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The High Court decision in <em>YG v YH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/58923-M.xml')\">[2008] SGHC 166</a>, at [9] also clarified that parties should also take a sensible approach towards the exercise of custodial rights and not be overly insistent on or calculative in respect of their rights. Joint custody does not require a spouse to consult the other spouse on every minor health issue of the children, but to consult on every intended hospital admission or hospital procedure unless it is not possible to do so as in the case of an emergency. In such a scenario, the spouse with physical care of the child at the time of hospitalization is perfectly entitled to make decisions in emergencies or when time is of the essence and the other spouse is uncontactable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32719-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 1</a>, the High Court also considered the issue of whether one party should have a veto power over specific decisions affecting the child e.g. for education related matters. The High Court was of the view that such a veto would trivialize the role of the parent who has no such power, allowing their word to be ignored [23]. Meaningful discussions between the parties will not be possible and this deprives parties of being able to see each other as partners with the common goal of ensuring that the child flourishes [23]. However, a veto power may be required where the relationship between the parties is so dysfunctional that the Court, rather than the parents, would end up making all the key decisions on behalf of the parents. This veto could be a useful way of minimizing the ongoing friction between the parties [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The above decision of <em>CX v CY</em> makes it clear that the Mother as care and control parent had sole authority to determine the day to day issues of the Child, including matters relating to non-school subject enrichment. However, decisions relating to subject tuition would be decided as a matter of custody. In the current scenario, I take the view that tuition here would only encompass tuition classes for the Child’s subjects after he had begun formal primary school education. Any classes up to that point would be regarded as enrichment, as they would not be based or addressing any formal educational curriculum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.   Father’s Claims to be a Better Care and Control Parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father claimed that he would have more time for the Child and be able to take better care of him. He provided examples of how the Child would put on more weight after living with him during the school holidays, the amount of time he spent with the Child, how he was able to complete the Child’s schoolwork with him. Emphasis was placed on how he would be able to devote personal time to the development of the Child. In contrast, he alleged that the Mother travelled frequently, used the Maternal Grandmother to carry out handovers and left the Child behind alone but was not even able to provide more than 2 occasions on evidence where this had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I need to set the context. As I will explain below in the section on child maintenance, the Father had not been in full time employment for 4 years. Naturally he had the benefit of being able to live and work flexibly. However, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. The Father had an income of $7,000 at the time he lost his job and it would not be fair for him to delegate that financial responsibility for the Child to the Mother while he took over care and control of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     So against this context, it was understandable that there would be occasions where the Mother might not be able to help the Child complete his work on time. This was after all his first year in primary school and adjusting to the new schedule required some time. The issue of the Child’s gain was never a problem and I had addressed this in <em>VPN</em> 1 (paragraph 11 to 20) and <em>VPN</em> 2 (paragraph 9(d)). At the end of the day, she was a working parent who had to balance both a job and caregiving and she was entitled to use all the help she could get to drop off the Child for handovers and pick-ups.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     When I asked the Father during the hearing how he expected to provide full time caregiving to the Child if he got a full time job, he said he would ask if the employer could make an accommodation and if not, there were always ad hoc jobs. He also repeated his point that he deeply loved the Child and that a primary caregiver should carry out the caregiving personally and not delegate. I have no sympathy with that mindset. I can accept that jobs are harder to come by these days, but this is all part and parcel of balancing the needs of the Child with providing financially for him. Plenty of parents in Singapore work to provide a dual income to support their children and family. Their children also learn other things, such as being able to be independent and to respect the value of being gainfully employed. I am not advocating complete neglect of the Child in pursuit of a career, but I do not see why a special dispensation should be given for an individual with a history of gainful employment like the Father to use his career slump as a weapon to engineer the reversal of care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also must remind that the caselaw on the reversal of care and control sets a high threshold, focusing on whether the current caregiver is harming the Child or alienating the Father. It is to these arguments that I now turn to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.   Allegations of Breach of Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A brief discussion of the Committal Application is necessary to understand the Father’s allegations in FSUM 931 that the Mother had breached the Order. As it stood, the Order gave the parties joint custody of the Child, but provided that the Mother had a veto power on preschool and childcare institutions and that she had to notify the Father of her choices.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Committal Application</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In the Committal Application. The Father had alleged that the Mother had committed 22 breaches, most of them being breaches of the joint custody aspect of the Order, namely that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother had breached her Joint Custody obligations by not allowing him to have access to the child’s pre-school application that provided parents with the child’s day to day progress, allowing the child to participate in performances and attend excursions in his pre-school as well as culinary and art classes at the People’s Association without notifying or obtaining the Father’s consent, not informing him of bumps and scrapes suffered by the child in school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother had enrolled the child into [A] preschool in September 2020 without consulting him, despite the applicable court order stating that the enrolment of the Child in preschool at that age would be decided solely by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the Mother had enrolled the child into [B] Preschool at Bishan from 29 September 2023 without consulting him as required under the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Failing to provide the Father with the specific address of the child’s pre-school at [B] Preschool at Bishan, even though her lawyers had specifically notified him of the branch (though not the address).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Failing to allow the Father to have access to the child from the childcare centre.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As can be seen, the Father had taken a selectively broad interpretation of custody to mount his Committal Application. This was pointed out by the Judge hearing the Committal Application who pointed out that in most instances, the Mother was clearly exercising her authority as Care and Control Parent, or as prescribed under the Order to make educational decisions for the Child as a matter of Custody. The allegations of breach of access were also not made out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Judge hearing the Committal Application found that accordingly, the only breach of the Court Order was the Mother’s enrolment of the Child in [B] Preschool at Bishan from 29 September 2023 without consulting him as required under the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Judge took the view that the Mother had mitigating circumstances for doing so, she imposed a $150 fine. For completeness, I will also share paragraph 18 of the Judge’s written decision which sets out the Mother’s reasons that were accepted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“The Father contends that the Mother unilaterally enrolled the Child into [B] @ Bishan since 29 September 2023 without first seeking his consent. Accordingly, she is in breach of the Joint Custody Order. The Mother admits that she had breached the Joint Custody Order in this case but in mitigation provided her reasons as to why she did so. According to her, the child’s enrolment at [A] was abruptly terminated in September 2023 by the school and she was provided with less than a month’s notice of this termination. At the time, there were barely two (2) months remaining in the academic year. As a result, she felt forced to scramble for alternative arrangements for the child during what she considered the most crucial phase of the child’s early education and was concerned that he would be permanently disadvantaged. She also explained that she had been given to understand at the time that the school had terminated the child’s enrolment as there had been issues between the Father and the school and the school did not want any further issues. This was disputed by the Father.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Father’s Reliance on Alleged Committal Breaches in FSUM 931</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In support of his application in FSUM931, the Father relied on these facts, characterizing them as examples of how the Mother was unilaterally making education and healthcare decisions without him. However, the Court’s decision in the Committal proceedings which was released on 18 June 2025 affirmed that save for the single incident referred to above which was committed in mitigatory circumstances, the Mother had not committed any breaches of the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Yet even after receiving this decision on 18 June 2025, the Father continued to insist in his written submissions that these acts amounted to breaches of the Order. When I asked him at the hearing on 28 October 2025 to clarify why he was still repeating these arguments, he said that (i) he was only a litigant in person and had relied on statements made on the websites of “expert lawyers” (ii) that the views of the Judge who had heard the Committal Application were not shared by other judges of the Family Justice Court (iii) the singular breach of joint custody by the Mother was a cardinal one and justified a reversal of care and control (iv) that even if the issues relating to enrichment classes and school outings fell within the ambit of enrichment, they were still custodial decisions for the health of the Child as knowing the location of the Child was important to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Save to say, I did not give these arguments any credibility. The Father was not as ignorant about the law as he claimed and had already been set straight by the Court in the Committal Application. Yet he insisted on pushing his version of the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">IV.   Allegations of Alienation (Deprivation of Access) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father also claimed that he had been denied access to the Child. In his final affidavit filed on 23 July 2025, he raised four instances in which he had been deprived of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>1 May 2025 (Thursday)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father claims he did not get access on that Thursday. According to the order, the Father is entitled twice a month to fetch the child on Thursday at 1.30pm instead of Friday for the weekend, and these Thursday access dates are to be decided by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The emails between the parties show that parties would agree the Friday and Thursday pick-ups in advance, but as the Father had picked up the Child on 10 April (Wednesday) in breach of the order thus gaining one additional day of access, the Mother had to adjust the agreed schedule once on 11 April 2025 for consistency, which the Father agreed to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Unfortunately, she subsequently realized that she would not be able to secure help to arrange the handover of the Child on one of the agreed Fridays (18 April 2025), and notified the Father that they had to return to the original schedule which meant the Father’s Thursday access on 1 May 2025 was changed back to 17 April 2025, and he would pick-up the Child for the weekend on 2 May 2025 (Friday).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father disagreed, not because he was unavailable but because he did not want to agree to a change twice. He challenged the Mother’s ability to make this change – even though the Order stated that she had authority to determine the Thursday access dates and made a police report on 1 May 2025 alleging a breach of the Order. In my view there was no breach at all. The Mother was simply exercising her powers under the order to determine the Thursday dates and there was no intention here to deprive the Father of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>5 May 2025 (Monday)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     This was a school holiday given on a Monday in lieu of Election Day which took place on 3 May 2025 (Saturday) and the Order provides that the parents shall share the school holidays equally. However, the Order does not specify exactly how it is to be shared. In this regard, the Father had written to the Mother proposing that his half share (12 hrs) of the 5<sup></sup>May 2025 holiday be split into two 6hr slots as an extension of his regular access. The Mother did not reply to him and on 5 May 2025, the Father filed a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I would not be so ready to call this a breach as there was no prescribed manner of sharing the school holidays and as the academic year 2025 has not been completed, it is not clear if the Father has actually been deprived of half the school holidays this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>June Holidays</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father claims that the Mother prevented him from seeing the Child for 2 weeks as she had chosen to split the June Holiday access into blocks of two weeks instead of blocks of 1 week. In my view there was no breach here as all the Order requires is that the parties share the school holidays equally and as far as the June holidays are concerned, the Father got his half.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>7 July 2025 (Thursday)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     This was a school holiday given on Thursday for Youth Day. The Father’s grouse here is not that the Mother refused to give him half the school holiday but that she refused to give him what he regarded as his 12 hour “half” of the school holiday as two blocks of 6 hour extensions to his regular access dates. In an email dated 7 July 2025 to the Father, the Mother explained that she could split the remaining four school holidays in the year equally, but with each parent taking two days each. Accordingly, there was no breach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">V.   Allegations of Alienation (Exclusion from Involvement in Child’s Life) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In a similar vein, the Father also referred to the same incidents and other examples where the Mother had informed the Child’s pre-school and primary school not to provide the Father with access to the parent communication applications. I consider some of these examples below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     [G] – The Father provided correspondence from the preschool stating that based on their records, the Father would be assigned “Guardian”, instead of “Parent” status for the Child’s preschool communication application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     [A] – The preschool informed the Father that in respect of access to the preschool communication application, the school would follow the direction of the parent with care and control of the Child and that he should seek the Mother’s permission if he wanted to have access to the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Excerpts of an alleged conversation dated 8 February 2022 with a Ms [C] from the Early Childhood Development Agency where she claimed that a person named “[D]” from the child’s preschool ([A]) had said that the reason why the preschool was not sharing information with him was because of an instruction from the Mother. I was careful not to rely on this as Ms [C] did not file an affidavit and she did not know she was being recorded. Her account of “[D]’s” position is also hearsay as she did not communicate directly with the Mother and was relying on what “[D]” had told her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Excerpts of an alleged conversation dated 15 April 2022 with a Ms [F] who was the head of the Primary 1 in [E] Primary School. Here, Ms [F] shared with the Father that the Mother had asked why there were more many parent and WhatsApp group chats at the primary school level than preschool. Ms [F] had explained to the Mother that she could not prevent the Father from having access to the ClassDojo application and parent’s group chats on WhatsApp. Ms [F] also said that the Mother agreed with her - “She say ya I agreed with that”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The above communications at (a) to (b) indicate the different approaches taken by preschools towards the amount of access to school information and communication applications. There was a tendency to prefer to communicate directly and seek authorization from the care and control parent in matters requiring parental authority and application access. I would not fault the Mother for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As for the allegations in (c) and (d) that the Mother was deliberately trying to exclude the Father from receiving information from the school, I make the finding that she was the care and control parent in charge of the Child’s day to day activities. She was legitimately exercising her rights as care and control parent in trying to ensure that there was one channel of communication through to her. I also appreciate that given the Fathers’ aggressive conduct in pursuing every single incident involving the Child in preschool (which I will address later), that the Mother was concerned about providing information to the Father about every single scratch, injury and affront to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">VI.   Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Father’s allegations against the Mother were driven by a strong desire to impose his own interpretation of the law. He picked and chose which aspects of the law he wanted enforced and even when proven wrong in the Committal Application, continued to insist that he was right. More aspects of this dogmatic and aggressive personality would surface in his conduct with the Mother in respect of the Child’s school matters which I will address in depth below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Therefore, I dismiss the Father’s prayers for a reversal of care and control and the consequential reduction of the Mother’s access to the Child. I also dismiss the Father’s prayers for orders prohibiting parental alienation i.e. communications with third parties in an educational context and with the Child as well as for a penal notice specifically for the Mother. However, what I will order here is that a penal notice be inserted in the Order which applies to both parties. This will remind both parties, in particular the Father to take heed of my point that Court orders need to be followed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">E.   SOLE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ALL DECISIONS IN RELATION TO THE CHILD’S EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND FOR DISPUTES ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS TO BE REFERRED TO MEDIATION </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I now turn to address the parties’ prayers on authority over educational, health and religious matters. Both parties essentially wanted full authority over educational matters whether they were day to day or long term, with the Mother wanting to restrict the Father’s interaction with the child’s school. The Father also wanted full control over health matters and for religious matters to remain a custodial decision but with the authority to refer disputes to mediation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   Education Decisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother’s concern with educational matters was that the Father was difficult to work with, citing his conduct during the Child’s primary school registration exercise in 2024. The Father referred back to his allegations of alienation by the Mother in withholding access to the Child’s school teachers, which I have already addressed. When I probed him at the hearing on why he felt that his sanction was needed even for school outings or enrichment classes, he explained this was necessary as these issues were tied to the safety of the Child and he needed to know at all times where the Child was. I did not think this was sufficient reason. If there were any safety issues that arose, the Mother could always be contacted by the vendor or school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Here, I think it is important to consider both the Father’s dealings with the Mother in respect of the Child’s Primary One Registration and his engagement with the staff in the Child’s kindergarten. They indicate that he had a combative nature which did not lend itself well to co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Primary 1 Registration</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Having considered the correspondence provided by both parties on this, I made the following findings of fact:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 25 March 2024, the Mother wrote to the Father with her proposed choices of primary school for the child – [H] School and [E] Primary School.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between 25 March 2024 to 4 June 2024, the Mother claimed that she had sent further emails to the Father. While these emails were not exhibited, it was not disputed by the Father that they were sent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 4 June 2024, the Father finally responded saying he was still considering the matter and that he would comply with MOE timelines. It had been more than a month since the Mother first wrote to him. On 19 June 2024, the Father responded, disagreeing with the choice of [H] School.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 10 July 2024, the Mother informed the Father she would be registering the child in [E] Primary School as proposed by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_e\"></a>(e)     From 11 to 12 July 2024, Phase 2A of the primary school registration took place. From 22 to 23 July 2024, Phase 2B of the primary school registration took place. The child was not able to get into [E] Primary School in either phase.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_f\"></a>(f)     From 23 July 2024 to 1 August 2024, parties were discussing which school the child should be enrolled in for both Phase 2C and Phase 2C supplementary. The Mother wanted the child to be enrolled in [E] Primary School for both phases. The Father wanted the child to be enrolled in [E] Primary School for Phase 2C and [K] Primary School for Phase 2C supplementary. Eventually the Mother agreed with the Father on 1 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_g\"></a>(g)     From 30 July to 1 August 2024, Phase 2C of the primary school registration took place. Parties confirmed that the Child is now registered in [E] Primary School.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I am not going to comment on which parent made the better choice of school. I was more concerned with the conduct of the Father during this process. What troubled me here was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s long delay in responding to the Mother’s initial email on 25 March 2024. He only provided a substantive reply on 19 June 2024, nearly three months later. While I appreciated that this was still 3 weeks before Phase 2A closed, given the importance of the primary school registration process, he should have been more responsive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s unnecessary use of personal and hurtful remarks against the Mother when he wanted to get his way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    Email dated 27 July 2024 – “What else do you have to argue, you never change, always think you know better when you don’t. It is good to have confidence but being complacent without any justification is <b><u>no difference from an empty vessel</u></b>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    Email dated 8 July 2024 – “You said I am not cooperative? My email reply to you dated 19 June 2024. You read and replied with <b><u>more ridiculous self-views of your supremacy</u></b> in your decisions as the ONLY RIGHT VIEW…”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    Email dated 8 July 2024 – “If you have problems containing your emotions and incapable to remove your mental blocks, it is <b><u>very high recommended for you to re-visit [M] for more medication and treatments and the senior consultant doctors from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) you had prolonged treatment at</u></b>…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">d.    Email dated 8 July 2024 – “Your <b><u>PSLE score are very bad you know, and your secondary school results even worst.</u></b> You ended up in a less than known “[N]” and <b><u>your secondary school results REMARKED “ITE”.</u></b> Your parents did not use “future planning “ for you, <b><u>please please kindly do not repeat in your parent’s foot steps on (son).</u></b>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">e.    Email dated 19 June 2024 – “[H] is not an SAP school form my research done. I personally knew of two adult persons whom I am familiar with. <b><u>One being a graduate from the school with criminal records, whom ended up in ITE school</u></b>. Second being another graduate from the same school with also criminal records, whom ended up not even in ITE (if I am not wrong), whom even gotten her face in the newspapers headlines for assaulting police officers and jailed, whom even am involved in the biggest laundering case in Singapore’s history as a party in the laundering process.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(emphasis in bold and underline)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I take the view that decisions of such importance do require more responsiveness and courtesy. Parties are entitled to their views and while I appreciate that it can sometimes be frustrating to persuade someone who holds a different view, there is no need to behave as unpleasantly as the Father did. Referring to the Mother’s parents, calling her names, belittling her level of education, using her mental health issues against her, this sort of behaviour does not have a place in the co-parenting process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Interactions with the Child’s Kindergarten</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Mother also cited her concerns with the Father’s engagement with the Child’s preschools which resulted in them terminating his enrolment with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     [A] Childcare – terminated on 29 September 2023, citing the <em>“observance of behaviors that have been unsettling and disruptive to our learning environment”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     [B] – terminated on 26 April 2024, citing that <em>“There have been recurring issues regarding adherence to our dismissal protocol, which causes distress among our staff and disruption to our operations. Despite our efforts to address this, we were not able to reach a resolution with (the Father).”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I will address each of these interactions below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <em><u>[A] Childcare</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In respect of [A] Childcare, the Father was accused by the Mother of harassing and abusing teachers and staff. They terminated the Child’s enrolment on 29 September 2023, citing the <em>“observance of behaviors that have been unsettling and disruptive to our learning environment”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I understood there was quite a bit of water under the bridge. In 19 June 2022, following an incident where the child had sustained a bruise to his forehead, the Father made a formal complaint to the Early Childhood Development Agency (“<b>ECDA</b>”). An investigation was carried out and the ECDA notified the Father by email dated 4 March 2022 that there had been lapses and non-compliance with the Early Childhood Development Centres Act and Regulation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     This incident affected the Father’s trust in the preschool and set the tone for future correspondence. Consequently, it appears that he ceased to communicate with his son’s teachers, preferring to escalate matters to the Principal. Threats were made to make a further complaint to ECDA when he felt he could not get his way. It appeared that he had absolute faith in the Child’s recollection of events, which made it difficult for him to accept alternative explanations even when investigations were carried out by the preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Here, the Mother produced WhatsApp messages between the Father and the Principal where:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In March 2023, the Father accused two teachers in the school of trying to cover up an incident where the Child was allegedly kicked by another child on the head while climbing up the ladder in the playground. The Father disagreed with the Principal’s finding that the other child’s feet had accidentally made contact with the Child’s head while the Child followed behind him on the ladder. He then threatened to submit the matter to the ECDA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In July 2023, the Father accused a school teacher of giving the Child a lesser portion of porridge than his friends. The Principal explained this was because the Child would gag if given more food. Eventually the Father asked that a video of eating times be taken to verify that the children were being given the same portion. He then followed up with a long tirade on previous incidents involving his child and the treatment of the matter by the previous principal. Threats were also made to go to ECDA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In September 2023, the Father accused the Principal and teachers in the school of hiding the fact that the child fell in school, even though they had notified the Mother. He then accused them of carrying out “little acts” behind his back as he had threatened to involve the ECDA (Early Childhood Development Agency) in his efforts to “protect” his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     It was not possible for me to determine whether the Father’s allegations against the teachers were made out based on the evidence provided. However, the conduct of the school did not appear to be high handed and they handled the Father’s with courtesy. The incidents in subparagraphs(a) and (b) above were relayed by the Child to the Father and were hearsay in nature. There was no objective evidence to rely on. As for the incident in (c), I accept that the teachers had adopted an approach where they would notify one parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In the circumstances, I could understand why [A] eventually decided to terminate the Child’s enrolment. While it was not specifically mentioned, it had simply become too difficult to continue dealing with the Father who threatened to escalate all matters to ECDA and refused to trust the school’s position. So the principal decided that it was best for parties to move on with a different school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\"> <u>[B] preschool</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In contrast, the Father’s conflicts with the staff of [B] arose as a result of the Father also resorting to an aggressive approach to enlarge his rights of access and other issues affecting the Child. The terminated the Child’s enrolment on 26 April 2024, citing that <em>“There have been recurring issues regarding adherence to our dismissal protocol, which causes distress among our staff and disruption to our operations. Despite our efforts to address this, we were not able to reach a resolution with (the Father).”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As provided in the Order, the Father would have access from Friday 8pm to Sunday 10am, and then from Thursday 1.30pm to Sunday 10am on alternate weeks or 2 weeks a month. The Father would pick-up the child at Bishan MRT and the Mother would collect her from Serangoon MRT.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     This was an order that was made in 2020 when the child only 2 years old and not in preschool. However, as he began to attend preschool, tensions emerged between the parents as the Father’s took the view that the Child should not attend preschool during his access. In <em>VPN</em> 2, he prayed that the Child stay with him from Thursday morning through to the weekend, which would effectively ensure this outcome. I dismissed this prayer and ordered the parties (including the Father) to pick-up the Child from preschool during their access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     What happened next was that the Father started picking up the child earlier from the [B] preschool and subsequently from [G] (which was the preschool the Child was enrolled in after that. The pick-up would usually take place between 3.30pm to 3.40pm on Thursday and Fridays as proved by screenshots of the Child. This meant the Child would miss some of his enrichment with the pre-school, which ended at 5pm to 5.30pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In respect of [B], this continued from 10 November 2023 to 24 May 2024, for a large part of the Child’s enrolment with the preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Having read the school’s termination letter which listed the cause of termination as a failure to comply with dismissal protocol which caused distress to the staff, this was clearly a reference to the Father’s decision to come and pick-up the Child earlier. In fact, the Mother had already sent emails to the school raising this as a concern.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In an email dated 17 November 2023, the preschool’s principal explained to the Mother that if the Father picked up the Child before 5pm she could only advise the Father on their curriculum hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In an email chain dated 25 January 2024, the Mother reminded the preschool’s principal that the school should let the Father know that the Child should not be released early. The principal replied to say that this had been communicated to the Father who disagreed as it overlapped with his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The Father pointed out that other preschools, such as [A], allowed children to leave earlier. He also provided pictures of other parents who were withdrawing children from [B] between 3.30pm to 3.40pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I note too that on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the Child’s enrolment in [B], on 8 November 2023, the Mother had instructed the school not to release the Child to the Father, but to the Maternal Grandmother. This resulted in a stand-off between the Father and the school, who eventually backed down after the police got involved and the Father produced the order. The Child was released to the Father eventually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Mother followed up with a lawyer’s letter to the preschool on 8 November 2023, asserting that the school should limit their interaction with the Father and direct communication from him to the Mother instead. The letter also prescribed that the Court order provided that that the court order required the Father’s access to the Child began after preschool ended.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Considering the above, I am of the view that the school found themselves caught between the Father and the Mother whose interpretation of my orders differed. It was likely to have been distressful for the staff to have to explain to the Father why he could not remove the Child early. It would also have been disruptive for the Child’s learning as he was being removed so regularly from the preschool. I appreciate that [A] had informed the Father the Child could leave early, but this was a different preschool. The examples provided by the Father of children leaving early were not helpful either as we could not be sure if these children were leaving early on as regular a basis as the Father. More importantly, the right of their parents or guardians to pick them up was not governed by a court order as it was in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     On the preschool’s protocol, the Father cited a statement on their website which stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“When it’s time to leave, emphasis that you will be back to pick him/her up in the afternoon and that you are excited about the day of school. Be specific about the pick-up time in a way that your child can understand. For instance, you can say “I’ll be back after you have had your afternoon nap and snack.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     Read together with the Child’s curriculum where naptime and snack concluded at 3.30pm, the Father relied on this example to justify picking up the Child after 3.30pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     I took the view that this was just a statement that was provided to assist parents with a guide on how to manage their children’s anxiety when dropping them off at school. I should point out that the statement “<em>I’ll be back </em><b><em><u>after </u></em></b><em>you have had your afternoon nap and snack</em>” would not apply in all scenarios, especially in the present case where the Child was attending further enrichment after 3.30pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     However, leaving aside the school’s protocol, what I am more concerned about here is a refusal by the Father to comply with the variation I had made in <em>VPN</em> 2. Ordering that both parties should pick-up the Child after preschool, I had explained at paragraph 14 of <em>VPN</em> 2 that <em>“I felt that it would be in the best interests of the Child to attend preschool regularly. This would help to familiarize the Child with the routine of attending classes, and the Child would also benefit from socializing with other children.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     Therefore, in this scenario, the Mother was correct to insist that the Order provided that the pick-up of the Child by the Father on his access days should only take place after the curriculum had concluded i.e. between 5.00pm to 5.30pm as the case may be. It was unfortunate that the Father found a way to disagree and take the Child out of school before the conclusion of the curriculum simply because he felt the remaining classes did not matter. The preschool understandably did not want to be caught in the middle and decided to terminate the Child’s enrolment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     What appears clear from the Father’s conduct and the disputes above is that it would not be easy for any school to have to be caught in the middle of a disagreement between both parties on the interpretation of the order. This would ultimately be disruptive to the child’s schooling and the parents must speak with one voice. If they are not able to, then it should be the parent with care and control of the child who the school communicates with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     As explained above, the Mother will continue to have sole authority to determine matters affecting the Child’s day to day matters as I have dismissed the Father’s application to reverse care and control. While I accept that there is certain information and involvement required by the Father, this should not be treated as some kind of reporting exercise and I will set out exactly what this means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Father has to accept that the Mother gets to decide the Child’s day to day activities, whether they are academic or extracurricular. That is the authority given to the parent who has care and control of the Child. She has enough on her plate and does not need to consult or notify the Father of every single matter that affects the Child. While caselaw has also opined that the choice of academic enrichment is a custodial issue, given the level of disagreement between parties on all educational matters and the Father’s aggressive and hurtful manner of conducting himself in these discussion, I feel it is better to extend the Mother’s custodial authority in this regard and empower her to have sole authority to make decisions on the Child’s academic enrichment classes too, subject to giving the Father the opportunity to share his views. Here, I would subject the Father to a deadline to respond to the Mother’s consultation and 48 hours seems fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The Mother would also be the only point of contact with the Child’s school and any vendors of extra-curricular classes scheduled for the Child, as well as his classmates and their parents. This would minimize the possibility for conflict between the parties spilling over and affecting the Child’s participation in school or other classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Any obligation to notify by the Mother would only extend to events or activities which require or allow the attendance of both parents, tuition classes for the Child’s academic subjects in school, and enrichment classes that occur on the Father’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     There is a balance to be struck here. In order to exercise his access meaningfully and participate in the development of the Child, the Father must also be allowed to have access to the Child’s ClassDojo application. This application will help the Father to track the Child’s academic progress and even help him with his school work. Of course, the main responsibility for coordinating the completion of school work and assignments still lies with the Mother who has care and control of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Father would also be entitled to have copies of the Child’s Report Book/Card, though the Mother would have authority to sign it. Similarly, where the Child’s primary and secondary school is concerned, the Father will have the right to attend activities that require or which allow the attendance of both parents. During these events, he shall be able to interact with the Child’s teachers, classmates and parents. I still expect the Father be responsible for knowing when these events take place if they are referred to in the ClassDojo application, but if they are not, then the Mother will be required to notify him of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     To ensure that the Father’s access is not fettered by the scheduling of classes for the Child outside of his school curriculum, I also order that if the Mother is scheduling classes (academic or non-academic) that take place during the Father’s access with the Child, the duration of the class shall not exceed 1 hour each day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Therefore, I make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In respect of the Child’s education, the choice of secondary school and his choice of subjects in secondary school will be an issue of joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother will be the sole point of contact with the Child’s primary and secondary school, his teachers, parents of his classmates and any other member of the school’s staff on all matters concerning the Child. She will also have sole authority to decide on whether the Child shall attend any excursions or activities (including the extra-curricular activities) proposed or organized by the school and does not need to consult the Father. There is no need for the Mother to notify the Father when the Child attends any events or activities proposed or organized by the school unless it requires or allows the attendance of both parents and is not set out in the Child’s ClassDojo application (or equivalent).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother will have sole authority to decide on whether the Child attends tuition classes for the Child’s academic subjects in school (“<b>Tuition</b>”) or non-academic enrichment classes (“<b>Enrichment</b>”) and the vendors for Tuition and Enrichment. Likewise, she will be the sole point of contact with the vendors and its staff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>i)       For Tuition, the Mother must consult the Father first for his views on the choice of subject and vendor and he shall have 48 hours to respond, after which the Mother may exercise her sole authority to make the decision, which she must notify to the Father of her choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>ii)       For Enrichment, there is no need for the Mother to consult the Father, but she must notify the Father of her choice if this takes place during his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother may schedule Tuition and Enrichment to take place during the Father’s access with the Child, but the total amount of time scheduled for Tuition and/or Enrichment may not exceed 1 hour on each day of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Father will be given access to the ClassDojo application (or equivalent) used by the Child’s primary or secondary school to disseminate information on the Child’s education and assessments, but for avoidance of doubt, only the Mother will be permitted to contact the Child’s teachers, parents of his classmates and any member of the school’s staff through the ClassDojo application (or equivalent).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father will be provided with soft copies of the Child’s Report Book/Card by the Mother within 24 hours after receipt of the Report Book/Card. However, the Mother shall be authorized to sign the Child’s Report Book/Card on behalf of both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Father will be entitled to attend all events and activities organized by the Child’s primary or secondary school, which require the attendance of both parents (e.g. Parent Teacher Meetings) or which both parents may attend (e.g. School Sports Day). On such occasions, he may speak with the Child’s teachers, classmates and their parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.   Healthcare Decisions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     In a similar vein, the Father was concerned that the Mother was not notifying him when the Child was unwell. He cited a few incidents where the Child had suffered some knocks in childcare and gotten an infection under the Mother’s care, but frankly nothing particularly severe had occurred which required the Child to be hospitalized. I took the view that these medical issues were just part and parcel of childhood and there was nothing seriously neglectful about the Mother’s care of the Child. To minimize conflict over these issues, I set out below the boundaries of the Mother’s authority in medical matters and the extent to which she is required to notify the Father and involve him in decision making.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother will only need to notify the Father if the Child is unwell and has to be absent from school for more than 1 day. This notification should be provided on the day the Mother is aware the Child will be absent from school for more than 1 day and in writing with a brief description of the issue causing the Child to be absent and how long he will be absent from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In respect of healthcare issues, the Mother will have sole authority to decide whether the Child should see a general practitioner, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, specialist, dentist or dental surgeon to be treated for any medical or dental issues, without need for the Father to be present. The Mother will only need to notify the Father of any medical or dental treatment that the Child has undergone. Notification should be given within 1 day of such treatment in writing with a brief description of the issue, the name of the medical/dental professional and the treatment. As an exception, notification is required only if the treated condition results in the Child being absent from school for more than 1 day. The Father will not be permitted to contact the medical/dental professional who has seen and treated the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If there is a medical issue requiring the Child to be warded in hospital for any treatment or surgery, this is a matter of joint custody requiring the Father’s approval. If this medical issue is urgent, the Mother has sole authority to make the decision for the Child to be warded in hospital for treatment or surgery, but must notify the Father of her decision within 1 hour. After the Child is warded in hospital, then both parents may visit the Child but subject to the regulations that the hospital imposes on visitors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If the Child requires medical or dental treatment while he is in the care of the Father, the Father may bring him to see a general practitioner, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, specialist, dentist or dental surgeon to be treated for any medical or dental issues, without need for the Mother to be present. The Father must notify the Mother of any medical or dental treatment that the Child has undergone within 1 day of such treatment with a brief description of the issue, the name of the medical/dental professional and the treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_e\"></a>(e)     If the Child requires medical treatment while he is in the care of the Father, and such treatment is required on an urgent basis and requires the Child to be warded in hospital, the Father shall have the authority to make the decision for the Child to be warded in hospital for treatment or surgery, but must notify the Mother of his decision within 1 hour. After the Child is warded in hospital, the both parents may visit the Child but subject to the regulations that the hospital imposes on visitors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The above orders are consistent with the Mother’s oversight of day to day matters as the care and control parent. She must be allowed to have rein to make these decisions on the child’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     While the Father preferred to be consulted and notified on every scratch, injury and affront to the Child, he needed to accept that this was not something the Mother was required to do. The obligation is to notify of him or medical or dental treatment and if the Child is absent from school for longer than 1 day. The right to notify will also only extend to treatment that results in the Child being absent from school for more than one day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     This also means that the Father will not have the authority to contact these medical or dental professionals who have seen and treated the Child. There is no point in allowing the Father to get involved in such matters as it would only bring more conflict to the situation and interfere with the Mother’s sole authority to determine such matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     Where I draw the line is surgery and hospitalization for a medical issue. This is a joint custody issue that requires the consent of both parents, though I accept that there may be instances where the need for medical intervention and hospitalization is urgent and arises when the Child is with one parent (e.g. the Father) and one parent has to be empowered to make this decision quickly. Examples of such urgency include e.g. the Child is involved in an accident, or experiences a sudden physical deterioration that cannot be addressed by a general practitioner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I have also inserted the usual requirements for visitation in hospital, allowing both parents to visit the Child, but subjecting it to the regulations imposed by the hospital.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     For avoidance of doubt, surgery and hospitalization for medical issues is distinct from any treatment that the Child may receive from a dental surgeon for dental issues. For such matters, the Mother shall have sole authority to decide them as she does for non-hospitalization medical issues, but must notify the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.   Religious Matters </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    Finally, I address the Father’s prayer on religious matters. The Father was asking for decisions regarding the Child’s religious upbringing to remain under joint custody and for the parties to attend mediation on any disagreements. At the hearing, he confirmed to me that there was presently no such concern about decisions being made about the Child’s religion. Therefore, I dismissed this prayer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">IV.   Effect of Orders on Education and Healthcare</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    To avoid future litigation on decisions on education and healthcare that had already been made in the past following the Child commencing Primary School, I will backdate my orders on education and healthcare decisions to take effect from 1 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">F.   THE FATHER’S ACCESS TO THE CHILD</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Presently, the Father’s access was divided into:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_102-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Regular Access – Access from Friday 8pm to Sunday 10am, and then from Thursday 1.30pm to Sunday 10am on alternate weeks or 2 weeks a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_102-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School Holiday Access - The school holidays to be shared equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    The Father would pick-up the Child at Bishan MRT and the Mother would collect her from Serangoon MRT. Both parties were required to pick-up the Child from preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    As the Child is now in primary school, his schedule with both parents needs to be adjusted so that he can get the best possible structure for his development. Given the Father’s inability to negotiate reasonably with the Mother on issues relating to access, I believe that as far as possible the Order should be specific on exactly when and how his access to the Child is to be exercised, so as to prevent him from creating further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I will address each category of access and general matters relating to access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   Regular Access Dates</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    On regular access, the Mother effectively wanted the Child to remain with her on all school days and for the Father to only have access to the Child from Friday 8pm to Sunday 10pm. This would effectively remove his twice a month Thursday access to the Child, and shorten his access to the Child on Friday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    This was on the basis that the Child would need to adapt to a primary school schedule. I felt that there were merits to reducing the Father’s access to minimize disruption to the Child’s routine, but I did not want to create too much disruption to the Father’s access to the Child. The Mother was also not able to prove that the Child’s academic performance was being affected under the current order and currently had full discretion to determine which weeks the twice a month Thursday access occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    Therefore, I provide that the Father’s regular access to the Child during the school term will be as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Friday 1.30pm till Sunday 10am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Thursday 2.00pm till Sunday 10am (Once a month, with the Mother having full discretion and authority to determine these dates).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    This would strike the balance to retain the majority of the Father’s overnight access with the Child while ensuring greater uniformity in the Child’s schedule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    Nevertheless, I was aware that in certain months during the year, the Child would have school vacations prescribed by the Ministry of Education ranging from 1 week to 6 weeks. The Father had also argued that he should be compensated for the loss of Thursday access during the lengthier school vacation periods. In these months, the Thursday access might create scheduling issues for the Mother and be disruptive for the Child’s schedule. Worse still, the Father would seek compensation for what he viewed as a “loss” of such access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    Therefore, I will order that the Father will not have additional Thursday access in the following months:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In the Months of March and September where there are two one-week school vacations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the month of November, where about 9 days of the year end school vacation occurs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the Months of June and December, where the most of and whole of the month is a school holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    This will hopefully make it easier for the Mother as the care and control parent to manage the Child’s schedule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.   School Vacation and Special/Public Holiday Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    The Child’s school vacation and holiday access was an important aspect of both parties’ access to the Child. The existing order only stated that parties should share their access to the Child equally, though it did not prescribe how this share takes effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    To clarify, there are three different types of holidays/vacations from school specified by the Ministry of Education (“<b>MOE</b>”) website:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_114-p2_a\"></a>(a)     School Vacation – These are the 8 day vacations periods in March and September and the longer vacations in mid-year (mainly June) and end year (November to December).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_114-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Public Holidays – These are the single date public holidays which also apply to school children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_114-p2_c\"></a>(c)     School Holidays – These are the single date holidays which MOE declares are holidays only for school children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>School Vacation Access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    The Mother took the view that the March and September vacations could be split with parties taking a half each, and for the longer mid-year and year end vacations to be split with parties taking alternative weeks instead of having the Child for a whole half. This actually accords generally with the Father’s intention to reduce the separation of the Child from each parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    Therefore, I order that the parties will share the following School Vacation periods as determined by the Ministry of Education:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_116-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The March and September Vacations – The Father’s access from the preceding week will continue till Wednesday 1pm of the vacation week. The Mother will then take the Child for the remainder of the vacation week. This effectively gives the Father 4 days out of the 8-day holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_116-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mid-Year and Year End Vacations with effect from the 2025 Year End Vacation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_116-p2_b-p3_a\"></a>a.       Parties will alternate each week with the Child in periods from Saturday 1pm to the following Saturday 1pm. In odd years, the Child will start the school vacation with the Father, and in even years the Child will start the school vacation with the Mother. I originally intended for the Mother to start the school vacations in odd years (i.e. this year) and vice versa for the Father as per my partial decision released to parties on 20 November 2025 that covered the year end 2025 school vacation, but I understood at the cost hearing on 28 November 2025, that the Father had retained the Child since 22 November 2025. So I have decided to reverse the order of sharing to take this reality into account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_116-p2_b-p3_b\"></a>b.       In years where the final week of the school vacation begins on Saturday 1pm, but ends before the following Saturday 1pm, that week of school vacation will also be treated as part of the rotation of school vacation weeks without make up access being given to the parent whom the Child is with in the final week of the school vacation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_116-p2_b-p3_c\"></a>c.       As an illustration, the division of the school vacation holidays from 22 November 2025 to 31 December 2025 are set out below.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"66.12%\"><col width=\"33.88%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Year End Vacation 2025 (Odd Year)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Period</b> </p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Parent that the Child is with</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1<sup>st</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to 2<sup>nd</sup> Week Saturday 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2<sup>nd</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to 3<sup>rd</sup> Week Saturday 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3<sup>rd</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to 4<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to 5<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to 6<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"r\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6<sup>th</sup> Week Saturday 1pm to last day of Vacation 1pm</p> </td><td class=\"\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    I have avoided labelling these vacations as the June and December vacations as they are commonly known, as the mid-year vacation sometimes begins in the last Saturday of May, and the year-end vacations usually start on the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of November. The year-end vacations also tend to end on a weekday, which complicates attempts for equal sharing. Therefore, the best way is simply to proceed on a weekly alternating arrangement with the order changing in even and odd years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Understandably to avoid conflict arising over any access that overlaps during these school vacations, I make it clear that these school vacations will take priority over the regular access arrangements. In fact, they shall have the highest priority of all access types. I will set out my orders governing the interaction and priority of the different types of access later on in my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>School Holidays and Public Holidays</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    As for the School holidays, I will lump them together with my treatment of public holidays as these are also single date holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    The approach here will be to treat all school holiday and public holidays as the same and alternate them, with the Father being entitled to the next school or public holiday after the date of this order. I will also provide for the following rules so as to minimize conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_120-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties will alternate the Holidays with the Child, with the Father taking the next Holiday after this Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_120-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parent that has the Child on a Holiday will have the Child from 10am to 10am the next day. If the next day is a school day, that parent will be responsible for sending the Child to school even if school begins before 10am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_120-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A “Holiday” is defined as a school Holiday determined by the MOE, or a gazetted Public Holiday. If a Holiday falls on the weekend and a holiday in lieu is given on the following Monday, that Monday is considered the date of the Holiday. However, a Holiday does not include the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> days of Chinese New Year, or any Holiday that falls during a School Vacation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    I observe here that the Father wishes to divide all such holidays by the hour. This meant that each party would accrue 12 hours access to the Child from each holiday, to be used to extend their own access with the Child in any manner. In an email to the Mother, he proposed extending his regular access to the Child by 4 hours on three separate occasions. This would frankly be difficult to administer and create more disputes between the parties as to when the additional access should take place. A simple alternating of holiday dates would suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Holidays that fell on a School Vacation would not be included in this alternation as I wanted the category of Holiday access to exist outside of the School Vacation periods and be treated differently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    As for the Chinese New Year period, this should be dealt differently from the rest of the other holidays as it included the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Days of Chinese New Year as well as a non-public holiday in the form of the reunion dinner. The Father asked for backdated Chinese New Year access to give him all Chinese New Years in order to compensate him for the loss of Chinese New Year access in previous years. I did not think it was suitable to do so as my orders never provided for Chinese New Year access to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    Therefore, I provide that the parties will alternate the Chinese New Year period (defined as the period after school or at 1pm on Chinese New Year’s eve (whichever is earlier) with effect from 2026.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"71%\"><col width=\"29%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Period</b> </p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Child is with Parent in Even Years /Odd Years</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">After school or at 1pm on Chinese New Year’s Eve (whichever is earlier) to 6pm on the First Day of Chinese New Year.</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father/Mother</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"r\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6pm on the First Day of Chinese New Year, to 10am on the Third Day of Chinese New Year.

As there are a total of 3 dinners and visiting periods, parties just need to accept there are compromises to be made and an alternating split is the best way forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.   Special Date Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    The Father was seeking access to the Child on special dates i.e. on his birthday (24 October), the Child’s birthday (19 November) and Father’s Day (3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday in June). This was on the basis that he should be entitled to it as a Father and that it was essential to his bonding with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    I did not think it was necessary to provide for so many special dates, given the existing access arrangements provided for plenty of opportunity for the Father to have access with the Child. Father’s Day in particular fell during the June school vacation which was already being alternated between parties. Therefore, I provide that during the Child’s Birthday and the Father’s Birthday (“<b>Special Date</b>”), the Father shall have access to the Child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If the Special Date falls on a day where the Father has access to the Child but no overnight access, the Father’s access on that date will be extended to 2.30pm on the day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Special Date falls on a day where the Father has overnight access to the Child, the access is deemed to be consumed and there shall be no make-up access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If the Special Date falls on a day where the Father does not have access to the Child, the Father will have access to the Child from 5pm to 8pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    This will ensure that the Father will be able to have lunch or dinner with the Child on these special dates. I did not make such provision for the Mother, who already has considerable time with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">IV.   Priority and Overlapping of Access as well as Make Up Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    It is likely that the above access dates will overlap or clash. Therefore, I make the following orders to resolve these issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    Where there is a clash between the time the Child spends with a parent, the arrangement with the higher ranking will prevail, with (a) being the highest rank and (f) the lowest:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_a\"></a>(a)     School Vacation Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Holiday Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Chinese New Year Period Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Father’s Special Date Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Father’s Regular Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Mother’s Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    Where the time that the Child spends with a parent under more than one arrangement overlaps, the overlapping arrangements will be treated as a single period of access or time spent with that parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    As access clashes and overlaps, there will be “lost” access. The current order clearly states that there will be no make-up access. This was intended to provide that if one parent did not exercise their access to the Child, there would be no make-up access to him/her. In <em>VPN</em> 2, the Father had prayed for make up access, which I dismissed. In this application, the Father has raised issues with how he had lost regular access that clashed with school holiday access and wants it to be made good to him. I will not be doing so. To allow make up access for what I consider regular interactions between the different access and care arrangements under the order would simply provoke more conflict between the parties and disrupt the Child’s schedule further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    Therefore, I make a further clarification that there will be no make-up access, including but not limited to access that cannot be exercised due to being of lower priority, access that overlapped with other access arrangements, or even for time spent travelling to send or pick-up the Child for Tuition or Enrichment when the Child is with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">V.   Pick-Up/Change of Residence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    I deal now with the pick-up point for the Child. The Mother wanted to be able to keep the current pick-up (Bishan MRT) and drop off (Serangoon MRT) points, but retain flexibility to determine a new location if she moves home. This intersects with the Father’s prayer that the Mother not be permitted to move the residence of the Child while he is in primary or secondary school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    I did not see any issue with the Mother moving her residence. There was no indication that she intended to move residence during the prescribed period of residence for primary school, which would have jeopardized the Child’s education. It would also have been unnecessarily draconian to force her to remain in her current residence until the Child completed secondary school. Therefore, I dismissed the Father’s prayers to limit the Mother’s change of residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    As the Child’s schedule is likely to become busier, it may no longer be practical in the future to retain the current pick-up and drop off points for access. To avoid conflict between the parties on the choice of pick-up/drop off, I order that the Mother will have sole authority to determine the locations for pick-up and drop off. There will be no change in the locations for handover unless parties agree in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    I also noted that on this point, the Father had also prayed that should he have care and control, he should be the one with sole authority to determine the handover and pick-up points for the Child. So I am sure that he will understand the importance of allowing the Mother to have this discretion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">VI.   Fetching to School/To enrichment classes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    The Mother also wanted to vary the Order to clarify that the Mother and her nominees (which include family members) would send the Child to and from school until the Child is independent and that the Father would send the Child to Enrichment classes on Saturday during his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    I had no issue with granting such an order, though I would clarify it to apply to both parties and that both parties will give notice of the nominee in writing to each other. The Mother is gainfully employed in a full time job, unlike the Father, and as I will explain later, I expect the Father to also focus on obtaining gainful and regular employment. It does take a village to raise a child and parties should be entitled to rely on their help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    This order will provide that while the Child is in their care, both parties and their nominees - which are limited to members of their household (including partners and helpers) and family members - will be responsible for sending the Child to or picking him up from Enrichment, Tuition, school or to school activities. To avoid any future conflict on pick-ups, I will also require parties to adhere to the exact start and end timings for the school, school activities or the Enrichment, Tuition vendors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    While I agreed that the Child should be allowed to attend school or these activities on his own after a certain age, setting a milestone will deter conflict over when he will be allowed to do so. Therefore, I order that in the year that the Child turns 12, parties may allow him to attend school or these activities and classes on his own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">VII.   Overseas Travel</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    On overseas travel, there was already an existing provision for overseas access provided that 1 month’s notice was given with the usual requirements to provide information on the travel dates, itinerary, accommodation and a phone number to contact the Child, as well as the handing over and return of passports.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    The Mother was seeking for a shorter notice period of 1 week, while the Father was asking for more detail to be provided in the notice of overseas travel, particular that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_143-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Flight and/or transport shall include – bus/passenger vehicle licence plate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_143-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Accommodation shall include – location and hotel room numbers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_143-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The travel itinerary shall include – Daily Schedule, transportation, destinations, activities, tour durations, dates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_143-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Full name of persons accompanying on the trips – photos of Singapore NRIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    I noted that certain details such as hotel room numbers and the vehicle license plates (if travelling by bus) might not be available on the date that notice was given. It was also onerous to provide a daily schedule as the travelling parent would want to have some flexibility to adjust the schedule during the overseas vacation depending on circumstances. It was also somewhat draconian to ask for copies of the NRICs of people accompanying the travelling parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    When I asked the Father why he needed so much detail, he explained that the safety of the Child was important to him. So he needed to know at all times where the Child was so that he could reach the Child in the event of any trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    The Father was not able to prove to me that the Child had actually run into trouble during any of the overseas trips he had taken with the Mother. While I felt it was important to clarify the requirements of the travel notice to avoid future conflict, it was not necessary to provide the amount of detail required by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    I also agreed with the Mother that the notice period could be shortened to 1 week. As long as the parties were travelling overseas with the Child during their time with the Child, it was not necessary to have such a long notice period of 1 month. Therefore, I order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Both the Mother and the Father are at liberty to take the Child overseas during the Child’s time with them. The travelling parent shall give the other party at least 1 week’s written notice in advance if either party were to travel out of Singapore with the Child when the Child is with them. The notice must provide the following details:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_147--p3_a\"></a>(a)       The country the Child is travelling to and the cities they will be visiting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_147--p3_b\"></a>(b)       The dates and duration of travel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_147--p3_c\"></a>(c)       Flight details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_147--p3_d\"></a>(d)       The location of the Child’s accommodation in that country/city.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_147--p3_e\"></a>(e)       A phone number by which the Child can be contacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The Child’s passport will remain in the custody of the Mother, and be handed over with the Child when the Father takes access for the period when he is travelling overseas with the Child. The Father will return the passport to the Mother with the Child when returning the Child at the end of his time with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    The only substantial change I have made here is to remove the reference to a “Travel Itinerary” and make clear that in lieu of that, parties will indicate flight details and the cities they will be visiting within that country. It will be sufficient that the Father has a phone number by which the Child can be contacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    The Father was also seeking for the non-travelling parent to have liberal video call access to the Child, making clear that purposeful attempts to prevent his access would not be allowed. I was cautious about making provisions for such access, noting that travel might be taking place in different time zones and be subject to the availability of an internet connection which might make this inconvenient. Moreover, if the overseas access was taking place during the travelling parent’s access, such video access should only be provided on an update basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    Therefore, I provide that the non-travelling parent will be entitled to a video phone call with the Child on the following basis:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_150-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If the period of travel is less than 3 days – A single call not exceeding 5 minutes over the whole period of travel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_150-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the period of travel is more than 3 days – Two calls not exceeding 5 minutes over the whole period of travel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    The travelling parent will have sole authority and discretion to determine when the call takes place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">G.   CHILD MAINTENANCE </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    The current maintenance order requires the Father to pay the Mother as monthly maintenance for the Child, 65% of all the Child’s expenses (except overseas holidays) within 7 days of production of receipts/bills into the Mother’s nominated account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   Changes in the Law </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    Since the order was first made in 2020, the Court’s approach to determining issues of maintenance has also shifted in favour of ordering a fixed maintenance sum. In <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>, [9 to 12] the Court provided an explanation on how maintenance for a child should align more with a “budget” approach using a fixed maintenance sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_153-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_153-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render the expenses “reasonable”. Parties must be able to show that the projected expenditure is reasonable having regard to the child’s standard of living and the parents’ financial means and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_153-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When quantifying these reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. Whether a receipt is required depends on the facts of the case and the production of a receipt is not conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_153-p2_d\"></a>(d)     It may be helpful for parties to draw up a “budget” where broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, with a corresponding reasonable sum proposed for each category.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_153-p2_e\"></a>(e)     This budget framework provides a baseline financial framework for the parties in respect of the child’s expenses and the Court will not be overly prescriptive on how these budgeted monies are specifically applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    In <em>CWR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a>, at [118], the High Court stated that individual items of expenses set out by the Court in its assessment of a child’s reasonable monthly expenses were a gauge. It was not practically possible for the child to spend exactly the same amount per month, every single month. The monthly sum of reasonable expenses reached was a fair way to provide a sort of “budget” for the maintenance of the child, and parties ought to manage their finances in a flexible and sensible way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.   The Father’s Proposed Variation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    The Father presented two alternatives for the variation of the order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_155-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Alternative A - His share of the Child’s expenses be apportioned according to the ratio of the parties’ gross income and not 65%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_155-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternative B – Each party would pay for the expenses that the Child incurred when he was with them. Future school and educational expenses would be mutually agreed in writing and the Father’s share would be apportioned according to the ratio of the parties’ gross income. All other expenses which could not be mutually agreed would be borne by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    In this regard, the Father cited several reasons for varying the maintenance, which I will address below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Father’s inability to find a new stable job.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    To recap, at the time the Consent Order was made in March 2020, the Father had a job in marketing which would pay him a basic salary of $7,000. He was asked to leave by email dated 9 March 2020 and had not been able to find a stable job since, despite sending out numerous job applications. He had tried his hand at ad hoc and part time jobs as a warehouse assistant, factory worker, valet driver and had obtained a security officer’s license. At the hearing, he informed me that he would be able to earn about $1,500 a month for these jobs which paid him in cash.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_158\"></a>158    I appreciate the last 4 years had been hard for the Father, but he does not have a good excuse for being unable to meet his income potential. It is not about actual, but potential income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_159\"></a>159    While the Father had put in a lot of job applications for deskbound jobs, these applications were for positions paying $3,500 to $7,000 and hence he was unlikely to succeed unless the Father underwent attempts to upgrade himself or work in another industry. There was no evidence that he had done so, save for his obtaining of a security officer’s license in December 2022. Even then, he did not provide any evidence of applying for a security officer’s job. At the hearing he told me that it was too expensive to go for further courses which would cost about $2,600 to $3,500. However, as a security officer, he also shared that he would be able to earn about $2,000 a month, which would be more than his current pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_160\"></a>160    I am not saying that the Father must become a security officer, but it was a good example of how he was not taking a long term outlook with his job search and his living arrangements. He did not have difficulty borrowing money from his family to continue maintaining the housing loan for the 4 bedroom HDB apartment he was living in. Why could that financial assistance not be used to grow his longer term income potential?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_161\"></a>161    The Father also claimed that he had spinal problems, providing a copy of a medical report dated 18 November 2009 which stated that he had lower back pain and that he had numbness in his feet and soles. Notably this had not prevented him from being employed from 2009 to 2020 and I did not give it much weight as a factor depriving him of the ability to find and maintain employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Mother’s improved income potential</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_162\"></a>162    The Mother was currently employed on a one-year contract with NTU, with a total salary of $60,000 for that period with a gross monthly salary of $5,000 a month with a take home pay of about $3,808.40. This was consistent with the declared gross annual income of $61,200 in her IRAS Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_163\"></a>163    The Father claimed that she should be regarded as having an increased income potential beyond that as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_163-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother was allegedly dissipating her assets, citing transfers of $24,090 from August to December 2024 out of her account, most of which were to her boyfriend. However, there was a nearly equivalent amount of $26,898.50 received from various sources, most of which were from her boyfriend. I did not see the point placing too much weight on these transfers in considering an application for the variation of maintenance where the focus should really be on the income of the parties and not their assets. Neither did I regard the transfers as representing her income as these were just mainly payments between the Mother and her boyfriend. It would be speculative to assume more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_163-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother was allegedly spending on what he perceived to be extravagant items, while he spent little on himself. This was not a strong point as I would be making my decision to apportion the parties’ share of maintenance based on their income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_164\"></a>164    Accordingly, I make a finding that the Mother’s income was a gross income of about $5,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Father’s “significant” expenses incurred for the Child on a monthly basis.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_165\"></a>165    The Father also claimed that his payments for the Child’s expenses were significant as the Child was with him for 9 days a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_166\"></a>166    It was concerning that the Father continued to make arguments that under the reimbursement version of the Order, the expenses of the Child included expenses that he was incurring on the Child while the Child was with him. This same argument was raised in <em>VPN</em> 2, which I dismissed. It was quite clear that he was using this as an excuse to minimize his obligations to pay child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_167\"></a>167    Moreover, the Father was not able to substantiate his “significant” expenses for the Child with evidence. At the hearing, he claimed – without reference to evidence, that he would spend $400 a month on the Child. Yet in his supporting affidavit for FC/SUM 1680 of 2024 filed on 29 May 2024, he referred to a monthly expenses form which set the child’s expenses as being $60 a month. That could hardly be considered a significant contribution taking into account the Father’s income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_168\"></a>168    I decided that it was time for the maintenance order to be varied to a fixed maintenance order and with the apportionment of expenses revised, for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_168-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The state of the current maintenance order had led to difficulties in the enforcement of the maintenance orders as parties would dispute the reasonableness of the amounts claimed by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_168-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I find that the Father would not be able to take home an income of $7,000 a month. It has been 4 years since he was able to find a stable job and this is the reality of the situation. However, he should at least be able to find a job providing him with an income equivalent to what the Mother has. So any expenses assessed for the Child that are spent by the Mother will be divided 50% between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_168-p2_c\"></a>(c)     What appears to be holding the Father back from earning a greater income and reducing his expenses are a professed love for the Child. As discussed above, he was looking to find a job that would allow him to personally spend with caregiving for the Child. He continued to live in a 4 bedroom sized HDB flat relying on his aged Mother to cover the housing loan so that he could maintain the Child’s original residence during the marriage. This was simply an obsession to persist with an unsustainable ideal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.   My Orders – Fixed Maintenance Order and Backdating</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_169\"></a>169    I had asked parties to make their submissions on whether a fixed sum maintenance order should be made and if so, should it be backdated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_170\"></a>170    The Mother submitted that it should continue to kept as an order for reimbursement of expenses to take into account future expenses and avoid future applications for a variation and backdated to the date of the last enforcement application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_171\"></a>171    The Father submitted that if a fixed maintenance order is made, it should be based on the child’s actual expenses as claimed by the Mother in her maintenance and apportioned on a ratio of the parties’ gross expenses. It should also be backdated to 2020 when he says the Mother earned more than him, and he be allowed to clawback what he had previously paid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Fixed Sum Maintenance Ordered</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_172\"></a>172    I took the view that the maintenance should be varied to a fixed sum maintenance. This would assist enforcement of the orders and provide clarity to both parties on what should be paid. Too much time was being spent by the Mother to liaise with the Father on the Child’s expenses and in the enforcement of these expenses. A fixed sum maintenance order would be more straightforward to enforce and at least there would be less issues for the Father to raise objections to where maintenance was concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Backdating Allowed</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_173\"></a>173    On the issue of backdating, there was also an enforcement order made in MSS xxx of 2022 on 15 November 2022, which had assessed arrears of maintenance as being $3,261.58 as of 8 June 2022 (but excluding the June 2022 maintenance).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_174\"></a>174    The variation would be backdated to June 2022, as the last enforcement order made on 15 November 2022 had assessed the arrears as of May 2022. This would also ensure there was less dispute between the parties on what was owed under the order. However, the expenses considered for maintenance would differ over the following periods:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_174-p2_a\"></a>(a)     June 2022 to December 2024 – In this period, the Child had not yet entered primary school and his expenses would mainly be focused on child care and living expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_174-p2_b\"></a>(b)     January 2025 onwards – In this period, the Child had already entered primary school and his expenses would mainly be focused on student care and his enrichment or tuition if any.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Backdated Period - June 2022 to December 2024</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_175\"></a>175    As a starting point for the first period of backdating, I considered the actual expenses tendered by the Mother in respect of MSS xxxx of 2024, which were incurred from June 2022 to June 2024. These expenses had been itemized in tables and exhibited in the Mother’s supplementary affidavit filed on 21 October 2024. For ease of reference, I set out a table below adding up the total amounts incurred each year by the Mother which I derived from her affidavit.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"29.84%\"><col width=\"28.7%\"><col width=\"41.46%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total</b> </p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Average per month</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">June to December 2022</p> </td><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4,742.40</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">395.20</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">January to December 2023 </p> </td><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,706.20</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">558.90</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">January to June 2024</p> </td><td class=\"br\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4,937.90</p> </td><td class=\"b\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">823</p> </td></tr><tr><td class=\"r\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total from June 2022 to June 2024 </p> </td><td class=\"r\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">16,386.5</p> </td><td class=\"\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>682.80</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_176\"></a>176    I rounded up the amount to $700 a month to take into account of incidentals and expenses that would be incurred from July to December 2024. My observation of these expenses was that the amount incurred by the Mother during this period was very fair considering the income potential of the parties and I did not see any items that were incurred out of extravagance. They were mainly for childcare, enrichment, food and clothing with some annual expenses for outings such as a pass for the zoo, which would average out to about $35 to $40 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_177\"></a>177    To this figure, I applied a 50% rate representing the Father’s equal share, bringing the total to $350 per month. While I understand that the Father was not engaged in full time employment, he did admit at the hearing that he would earn about $1,500 a month from his part time work. That was sufficient to cover the Child’s maintenance, and while he did have debts to banks and for his housing loan, these were being covered by his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_178\"></a>178    So for the period from June 2022 to December 2024, the Father would have to pay the Mother $350 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Backdated Period – January 2025 onwards</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_179\"></a>179    As for the period from January 2025 to date and onwards, I considered the Mother’s monthly expenses for the Child as set out in the table in her affidavit filed on 6 November 2024, which she indicated as the Child’s monthly expenses. The amounts claimed and my position taken are addressed in the table below.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_180\"></a>180    So I find that the Child’s monthly expenses from January 2025 and onwards are $1,031, which I round up to $1,150 to cover any incidentals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_181\"></a>181    In coming to my decision, I acknowledge that forecasting the future expenses of a child are not straightforward. The amount here takes into account the amount of time that the Child spends with the Father, especially during the school holidays and on the weekends, during which the Father also incurs his own expenses with the Child. This is why amounts for travel, toys, entertainment are being borne by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_182\"></a>182    While the amount is higher than what the Mother was seeking in 2024, the Child’s expenses are on an upward trend. The average costs of the Child’s expenses up till December 2023 were about $652 a month and the average costs in 2023 – the year before the Child begin primary school ($823). I expect these expenses to increase as the Child is in primary school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_183\"></a>183    The Father’s share of this amount would also be 50%, which amounts to $575 a month. This is also within his current income, and certainly well within his income potential of about $5,000 which is equivalent to the Mother’s. However, I accept that he is not fully employed at the moment, so from January 2025 to February 2026, he will continue to pay $350 a month, and pay the full $575 a month from March 2025 onwards. This gives him a full 3 months from the date of my decision to get back to fulfilling his income potential.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_184\"></a>184    For avoidance of doubt, each of the amounts of maintenance due in each month from June 2022 onwards are payable on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of each month into the Mother’s designated account. I have changed the original payment date from the last day of the month so that the next payment date will fall on 15<sup>th</sup> December 2025 – giving the Father more time to prepare this sum of money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_185\"></a>185    The fixed sum maintenance represents what the Father is to pay the Mother every month for the expenses of the Child. As I have already taken into account the time the Child spends with the Father in determining the expenses, he shall not be entitled to set off any amounts he spends directly on the Child or this would create an opportunity for him to avoid payment of this maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_186\"></a>186    As for how these arrears are to be repaid, I leave that to be determined in MSS xxxx of 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">H. </font>COSTS</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_187\"></a>187    In respect of FC/SUM 1680 of 2024, each party will bear their own costs. This is because the prayers for variation of maintenance are repeated in FC/SUM 931 of 2025, and I will deal with them holistically in FC/SUM 931 of 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_188\"></a>188    In respect of FC/SUM 2583 of 2024, the Father will pay the Mother $4,000.00 in costs. The Mother largely succeeded in her efforts to gain authority in areas of education and the Father’s access to the Child’s schools. I also reduced the Father’s access, though not as much as the Mother wanted. The amount reflects the considerable amount of affidavits that were filed in these proceedings, and the lengthy nature of the Father’s evidence with a few 700 page affidavits (excluding exhibits) which the Mother had to respond to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_189\"></a>189    In FC/SUM 931 of 2025, the Father will pay the Mother $3,000.00 in costs. He did succeed in getting his share of maintenance reduced, though not to the extent that he wanted as he originally wanted the apportionment to cover the Child’s expenses with both parents and not just the Mother. More importantly he lost the application to reverse care and control and the reduced access to the Mother that came with it. The amount here also reflects the considerable amount of evidence filed by the Father that the Mother had to deal with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   CONCLUSION</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_190\"></a>190    I now come to the end of my decision and have some words for the parties going forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_191\"></a>191    To the Father, I understand that you love this Child very much and would like to have an equal voice in all matters affecting the Child. That is not possible in a post marriage scenario and I have explained why. I also appreciate that it is disappointing to realize that your views of parenting do not align with the legal position. To avoid any further misunderstandings, I have articulated the matters which you share this responsibility with the Mother and the matters in which you don’t. If you are dissatisfied, you may appeal. If you don’t appeal, then understand that resisting my decision will ultimately bring unnecessary conflict which you and the Mother do not need. Your fight has gone on long enough. Throughout the proceedings, I sensed that you are a man with a lot of drive. It cannot be easy to draft 700 page affidavits as an individual. I also know that you are a loving Father and have contributed to the Child’s growth, but there is no need to be a martyr when it comes to earning more money for this Child’s expenses. I am sure that if you devote your efforts and adopt a flexible mindset to increasing your income, you will succeed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_192\"></a>192    To the Mother, I know that you have struggled too. You face a battle on three fronts. To keep your full time job. To raise this child. To negotiate all this while being embroiled in the current proceedings with the Father for the last 5 years. You are tired, but it takes a strong person to do all these things and I acknowledge that this Child would not be where he is today without your contribution as a Mother and breadwinner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_193\"></a>193    To both parties, the time for acrimony is past. 5 years is long time and you still have 14 more years till this child turns 21. Try to make life a little easier for each other. I have done what I can to anticipate future issues where conflict may arise, which is why my final order is unfortunately quite long.

In such cases, courts apply the “structured approach” to divide the matrimonial assets: <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a>.

In carrying out this exercise, I adopted the settled position that matrimonial assets in the form of CPF funds and bank accounts are typically valued as at the date of the Interim Judgement, while the other types of matrimonial assets are valued as at the date of the ancillary matter hearing: see e.g., <em>UYP v UYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\"

The background to this is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 2019, the Husband took a bank loan <em>on behalf of</em> Mr and Mrs T.

These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I find it inherently incredible that Mr and Mrs T would be willing to lose $130,259.06 (by helping to pay the Husband’s taxes) simply to return him $20,000. The Husband has failed to explain this glaring anomaly in his case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is the Husband’s evidence that after the property transaction, he had issued the Cash Cheque ($410,500) to return funds that belonged to Mrs T: see [18(c)(3)] above. Logically, he could have used this occasion to return the $80,000 to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, if one were to add up the amounts in [18(c)(3)] to [18(c)(5)], they would come to a total of $570,000 – i.e., the referral fee that the Husband had earned from the property transaction: see [18(c)(2)] above. In other words, the referral fee has been fully accounted for and there is no surplus of $80,000 due to Mrs T from the property transaction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband has failed to explain why he would return the $80,000 to Mrs T only in November 2024 (i.e., when the time-deposit matured). This is about 19 months after the Cash Cheque was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband has failed to provide any evidence to show that he had paid $80,000 from the time-deposit to Mrs T.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband bears the burden of proving his claim by adducing credible and cogent evidence. He has failed to do so. It is not for the Court to plug the inadequacies in his case, e.g., by engaging in speculative reasoning. Accordingly, I find that <b>$80,000</b> from the $100,000 should be <em>included</em> in the matrimonial pool for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">OCBC 360 account no.

At of that date, the account had only $9,726.93.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, at around the date of the Interim Judgement, the account had $80,000 which belonged to Mr and Mrs T.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I am unable to accept the Husband’s submissions. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As stated earlier (see [5] above), it is settled law that matrimonial assets in bank accounts are valued as at the date of the Interim Judgement. A party who contends otherwise will have to prove why a different date for valuation should be adopted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I find that the Husband has failed to discharge his burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Husband did not provide a clear explanation in his affidavits as to why the $80,000 should not be divided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, during the hearing, his counsel appeared to rely on the claim in [18] above as his case theory for suggesting that the $80,000 belonged to Mr and Mrs T. Based on this case theory, the Husband <em>would already have returned</em> these funds to Mrs T when he issued the Cash Cheque: see [19(b)] and [19(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, if the $80,000 was not included in the Cash Cheque and was instead paid to Mrs T separately, then there should be evidence of such a payment. Logically, the payment would have been made sometime between 30 September 2024 (the date when the $80,000 was still in the account) and 31 January 2025 (the date when the account shows only $9,726.93). No evidence of such payment has been produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       Instead, the bank records show that during this period, there were (1) multiple withdrawals from the account to pay for the Husband’s personal and other expenses, and (2) several huge transfers of $10,000 (three occasions) and $20,000 (three occasions) to a person bearing the same English name as the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In other words, the evidence shows that the Husband had used the $82,881.53 in the account as if they belonged to him – and not to Mr and Mrs T.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the above reasons, I find that the funds in the account as at the date of the Interim Judgement – i.e., <b>$82,881.53</b> – is liable for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Assets in the Wife’s sole name</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I now come to the assets held in the Wife’s sole name.

In assessing whether the renovations fall within this category, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>One</em>, the inquiry is <em>not</em> whether the renovation made the home <em>more</em> habitable or <em>more</em> conducive for habitation. Instead, the inquiry is simply this: Was the renovation required to make the home habitable? Or, put in another way: Was the home unhabitable without the renovation?</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Two</em>, the inquiry into whether the home was habitable when it was first acquired is an <em>objective</em> one – i.e., could the home have provided basic shelter and was fit for occupation at the material time. If the answer is yes, then the home was habitable. This is so even if the parties <em>subjectively</em> (1) had found the home to be dated or to have sub-optimal amenities, or (2) had preferred the home to be renovated to make it more comfortable. If the parties’ subjective opinions are used as the test for determining habitability, this can lead to great uncertainty in the law. This is because such opinions can be arbitrary and can change over time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Three</em>, in assessing whether a renovation was necessary to make the matrimonial home habitable, relevant factors include the following: (1) When did the parties acquire the home, carry out the renovation, and move into the home? (2) Was the home acquired as a new project or from the resale market? (3) If the latter, how old was the home and what was its condition at the time of acquisition? (4) Were there defects which made the home unfit for occupation at the material time? (5) What was the nature of the renovation and was it remedial or elective? Depending on the facts, a court may assume that renovation made around the time of the acquisition of the home were carried out to make it suitable for them to live in: <em>WFE</em> at [59].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The second situation where renovation expenditures may qualify as direct contributions is where the renovation had <em>substantially improved the matrimonial home</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       A renovation can have such an effect if it made the home significantly <em>more functional</em>. This is so even if the improvement did not eventually translate into an increase in the home’s resale value. This is because home prices are dependent on sentiments in the property market: <em>XIB v XIA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33441-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 40</a> at [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Factors that can assist in assessing whether a renovation had substantially improved a matrimonial home include the following: (1) The scale of the renovation (<em>WTL</em> at [34]); (2) Whether the renovation involved structural works; and (3) Whether the renovation had increased the living space of the home or involved the rectification of major defects (e.g., water ingress and unsafe wiring). For renovations which took place long after the acquisition of the home, clear evidence is necessary to show that they had substantially improved the home: <em>TZQ</em> at [69]; <em>XNI</em> at [6].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       In my view, it would not be appropriate to treat renovation expenditures that simply <em>improved the family’s comfort or enjoyment</em> of the home (“<b>elective renovations</b>”) as direct contributions. This is so even if the expenditures were substantial. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Elective renovations seek to <em>enhance the family’s well-being</em>. Expenditures of such a nature have typically been treated as indirect contributions. To treat elective renovation expenditures as direct contributions will blur the conceptual differences between the two types of contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       If elective renovation expenditures are treated as direct contributions, they can materially affect the division of the home. This can lead to unfair outcomes in two situations. <em>One</em>, where the parties did not, at the material time, intend for the renovation to alter their shares in the home ownership. <em>Two</em>, where the renovation would have to be replaced over time due to wear and tear. In the circumstances, it is fairer to treat elective renovation expenditures simply as an aspect of indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The third situation where renovation expenditures may qualify as direct contributions is when they had <em>substantially increased the value of the matrimonial home</em>. It bears noting that the mere fact that the home has appreciated in value is insufficient proof that the renovation falls within this category. This is because the appreciation may be due to a general increase in property prices in Singapore: <em>XNI</em> at [6]. To assess whether the renovation had substantially increased the value of the home, one potential source of evidence is on-site valuation reports.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Renovation expenditures not proved to be direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Applying the above considerations, I find that the Husband <em>has failed to prove</em> that the Relevant Renovations (1) were required to make the Flat habitable when it was first acquired, (2) had substantially improved the Flat, or (3) had substantially increased its value. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Flat was built in 1997<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and acquired by the parties in March 2001.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Relevant Renovations were clearly carried out years after the Flat was acquired: see <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. On the evidence, it is unclear when the parties had moved into the Flat. In the circumstances, there is no presumption that the Relevant Renovation were necessary to make the Flat habitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from generic descriptions, the Husband had provided very little details regarding the Relevant Renovations. Given the dearth of evidence, many of the questions in [37(a)(iii)] and [37(b)(ii)] remain unaddressed. For instance, it is unclear whether the renovations were remedial in nature and were thus necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In fact, on the Husband’s own evidence, the renovations between 2016 to 2020 (see <b><u>Annex A</u></b> at items 19, 22, 28, 29 and 48) appear to be elective in nature. This is because it is his case that these renovations were carried out “at the request of the children” and in a “bespoke fashion”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Further, it is unclear to what extent the Relevant Renovations had improved the functionality and resale value of the Flat. This evidential gap could have been addressed, for instance, by submitting a professional valuation report on the Flat. In making this observation, I am mindful that the Wife has submitted a <em>desktop</em> valuation report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> on the Flat. In my view, this report does not address the relevant issues. As the Husband had rightly pointed out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Desktop valuations do not involve a physical inspection of the property. They cannot account for the specific condition of the unit, including its state of repair, the quality of renovations (or lack thereof), and its specific facing and layout, all of which are crucial determinants of value. In the present case, it is clear from the desktop valuation report that the maker of the report did not make any physical inspection of the property;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Accordingly, I find that the Husband’s expenditures on the Relevant Renovations do not qualify as direct contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ share of direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In this case, I find that the parties’ direct contributions consist of (a) their payments towards the acquisition of the home (<em>Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1276.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1276</a> at [82]) and (b) their other financial contributions to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Considering these contributions, I assess the parties’ relative direct contributions to be <b>75% (Husband)</b> and <b>25% (Wife)</b>.

There are two children to the marriage. The Wife filed for divorce on 21 January 2025, citing the unreasonable behaviour of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was obtained on the 17<sup>th</sup> of July 2025. Because there was no common ground to be found, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. To that end, the both of them took out the following applications for disclosure:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SUM 2891 of 2025 (“SUM 2891”) was the Wife’s application for disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SUM 2894 of 2025 (“SUM 2894”) was the Husband’s application for disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard both SUM 2891 and 2894 on 13 January 2026. The Wife was represented by Ms Fang Yashi (“Ms Fang”). The Husband was represented by Mr Jevan Li (“Mr Li”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Judgment was reserved. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given that the originating application for divorce was filed after 15 October 2024, it is the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“FJ(G)R 2024”) that apply: P 1, r 2(2) of the FJ(G)R 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There are a number of marked changes between the disclosure regime under the FJ(G)R 2024 and the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”). For one, the language has been simplified. What was once known as “discovery” and “interrogatories” are now referred to as applications for the disclosure of documents and information respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Further, parties are no longer required to make a voluntary request for disclosure of documents or information prior to taking out an application for disclosure: see r 63(4) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, the FJ(G)R also provides that parties are limited to filing a single application for disclosure – any additional applications for disclosure will only be allowed in certain circumstances: P 9, r 5(2) and (4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Of all the changes wrought by the introduction of the FJ(G)R 2024, the most pertinent one relates to the applicable test that the court applies in determining whether to order disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Under the FJR 2014, it was well-established that in considering whether to order discovery and/or interrogatories, the applicable test was that of relevance and necessity: see <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [6].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In contrast, P 9, r 4 of the FJ(G)R 2024 sets out what the requesting party must demonstrate to the court in order to obtain an order for disclosure:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Order for disclosure (P. 9, r. 4)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.—(1)    The Court may order a party to disclose the original or a copy of a specific document or class of documents in the party’s possession or control (called the requested documents), or specific information or a specific class of information in the party’s knowledge (called the requested information), if the requesting party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    properly identifies the requested documents or requested information, as the case may be; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    shows that the requested documents or requested information, as the case may be —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    is material to the issues in the case; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   falls within one or more of the categories in paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The categories mentioned in paragraph (1)(b)(ii) are the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    all documents which the requesting party will be relying on;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    all known adverse documents or information, including documents or information which a party ought reasonably to know is adverse to the party’s case;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    where applicable, documents or information that falls within a broadened scope of disclosure —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    as may be agreed between the parties or any set of parties; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   as ordered by the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Crucially, as is set out in P 9, r 4(1)(b)(i), the requesting party must show that the requested documents or information are material to the issues in the case. This, of course, raises the issue as to how the court should assess whether the requested documents or information are material to the issues in the case, and whether this assessment of materiality is any different from the previous twin criteria of relevance and necessity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Mr Li argued that reference could be made to the O 11 r 3(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”) which was <em>in pari materia</em> with P 9, r 4(1)(b)(i) of the FJ(G)R 2024. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Production of requested documents (O. 11, r. 3)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.—(1)    The Court may order any party to produce the original or a copy of a specific document or class of documents (called the requested documents) in the party’s possession or control, if the requesting party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    properly identifies the requested documents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>shows that the requested documents are material to the issues in the case</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     To that end, Mr Li cited me the following two decisions that have discussed O 11 r 3 of the ROC 2021: <em>Eng’s Wantan Noodle Pte Ltd and another v Eng’s Char Siew Wantan Mee Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30514-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCR 17</a> (“<em>Eng</em>”) at [47] – [50] and <em>Cachet Multi Strategy Fund SPC on behalf of Cachet Special Opportunities SP v Feng Shi and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31976-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCR 8</a> (“<em>Cachet</em>”) at [25] and [29] – [33]. In this vein, Mr Li made the point that the test of materiality under the FJ(G)R 2024 was stricter than the old test of relevance and necessity, and that the court should assess materiality with reference to the issues raised in each party’s ancillary matters affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Both <em>Eng</em> and <em>Cachet</em> make clear that the threshold of materiality is indeed a higher one than that of relevance and necessity. As was expressed in <em>Eng</em> (at [49(b)]), the “threshold of materiality requires the requested documents to have a significant bearing on an issue in a case, such that it could potentially affect the court’s ultimate decision”. The court in <em>Cachet</em> further elaborated on this, explaining that the term “materiality” dealt squarely with the likelihood of the requested document having a bearing on the court’s decision on the disputed issue, or in other words, the “likely impact on the adjudicative outcome” (<em>Cachet</em> at [33]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Although both <em>Eng</em> and <em>Cachet</em> were dealing with disclosure in the context of civil proceedings, given that O 11 r 3 is <em>in pari materia</em> with P 9, r 4 of the FJ(G)R 2024, I accept that the principles laid down in <em>Eng</em> and <em>Cachet</em> in relation to the test of materiality are applicable, with suitable modifications to account for the nature of the hearing of ancillary matters, to disclosure applications under P 9, r 4. Parties should demonstrate that the requested documents have a “significant bearing” on the issues in dispute at the ancillary matters hearing such that the documents sought would potentially “affect the court’s ultimate decision”. In short, the inquiry is focussed squarely on how the requested documents will have an impact on the adjudicative outcome: <em>Cachet</em> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To illustrate the point, take for example, a request for bank statements. It would not suffice to simply state, under the new disclosure regime instantiated in the FJ(G)R 2024, that these bank statements would have a bearing on the division of matrimonial assets, or on the issue of spousal or child maintenance. The requirement of “materiality” demands that the requesting party go one step further to set out <em>how</em> these bank statements would affect the court’s determination of how the assets are to be divided, or the appropriate amount to be ordered in respect of maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having set out the applicable principles relating to the requirement of materiality, I turn now to deal with the items that both parties had proceeded with in SUM 2891 and 2894.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I deal first with SUM 2891, which was the Wife’s application for disclosure. At the hearing, Ms Fang confirmed that her client was only proceeding in respect of one item. As stated in SUM 2891, this item was basically a request for formal documents showing the arrangement between the Husband and his employer regarding the use, finance and ownership of a vehicle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Notwithstanding the request as framed in SUM 2891, during the hearing, Ms Fang clarified that that request was actually a request for documents showing the value of the vehicle. While the dispute between the parties was whether this vehicle constituted a matrimonial asset, the point Ms Fang made was that the value of the vehicle would be material in the event the court found that it was a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Mr Li, on the other hand, raised two objections to the Wife’s request. First, that based on the request as originally framed in SUM 2891, the documents sought had already been disclosed. Second, that the request had not been clearly framed, and the court should not allow parties to, at the hearing, depart from the original request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I agreed with the second point made by Mr Li. It is clear from the FJ(G)R 2024 that the new disclosure regime envisages that much more care and thought be put into requests for documents and/or information. For instance, the FJ(G)R 2024 makes it clear that the requesting party must properly identify the requested documents or information. It goes without saying that if such requested documents or information are not properly identified, the requesting party would, in all likelihood, be unable to explain how these documents or information were material to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given that the documents sought were not properly identified in the first place, I am not inclined to grant the Wife’s request. In any event, there is no need for me to make such an order. The Husband had stated the value of the vehicle at paragraph 44 of his First Ancillary Matters Affidavit. P 9 r 3 of the FJ(G)R 2024 makes it clear that the Husband <em>must</em> disclose the documents that he is relying on to support the alleged value of the vehicle, and if he is unable to provide those documents or refuses to do so, he must furnish reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I therefore make no order in respect of the Wife’s sole request that she had pursued in SUM 2891.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I turn now to SUM 2894. At the hearing, Mr Li clarified that the Husband was only pursuing the requests as set out in Items 12, 13, 15, and 16. These were the requests as framed in SUM 2894:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 12 was a request for documentation that the Wife had solely borne the rental expenses from 2010 to 2012.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 13 was a request for the Wife’s income tax notice of assessment for the period 2010 – 2012. The reason for this request was that it related to the extent of the Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage, specifically, to prove that she had indeed borne the rental expenses during this period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Item 15 was a request for the Wife to provide “any evidence to state (i) the time period and (ii) any evidence to support the allegation that” various financial outlays had been made by her as stated in her First Ancillary Matters Affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Item 16 was a request for the Wife to provide “any evidence to state (i) the time period parties had a domestic helper” and “(ii) any evidence to support the allegation that the payment to the domestic helper was mostly” borne by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Insofar as Items 12, 13, 15, and 16 related to various matters alleged in the Wife’s First Ancillary Matters Affidavit, it is clear from P 9 r 3 of the FJ(G)R 2024 that she must disclose documents to substantiate her allegations, or provide a reason if she is unable or unwilling to provide disclosure of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I will therefore make no order in relation to Items 12, 13, 15, and 16.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Parties are to write in, by way of letter to court, with their respective positions on costs. This is to be done no later than 3 February 2026. Cost submissions are limited to a maximum of 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Li and Ms Fang for their able assistance.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Mental Capacity – Cognitive Impairment – Functional and Clinical Components – Capacity to execute documents"],"date":"2026-01-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSM 262/2021","title":"XYF v XYG and another","citation":"[2026] SGFC 9","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34389-SSP.xml","counsel":["Nicholas Poon Guo Kun (Breakpoint LLC) for the Plaintiff","Basil Ong Kah Liang, Suresh Sukumaran Nair and Too Tat Rui (PK Wong & Nair) for the 1st Defendant","Blossom Hing S.C., Joshua Chin Tian Hui and Jane See Chai Kiat (Drew and Napier LLC) for the 2nd Defendant."],"timestamp":"2026-01-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XYF v XYG and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XYF <em>v</em> XYG and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34389-SSP.xml')\">[2026] SGFC 9</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OSM 262/2021</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 January 2026</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Nicholas Poon Guo Kun (Breakpoint LLC) for the Plaintiff; Basil Ong Kah Liang, Suresh Sukumaran Nair and Too Tat Rui (PK Wong &amp; Nair) for the 1st Defendant; Blossom Hing S.C., Joshua Chin Tian Hui and Jane See Chai Kiat (Drew and Napier LLC) for the 2nd Defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XYF — XYG — XYH </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Mental Capacity</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Cognitive Impairment</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Functional and Clinical Components</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Capacity to execute documents</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 January 2026</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Many assumptions are often made of the cognitive abilities of the elderly. These tend to be from observations by those living with or having associations with this vulnerable group. While these observations are important and provide some degree of insight into the capacity of an aged individual to make decisions for himself, it often are inferences garnered from the words that are used, the tone that is taken and the divergence of behaviour from previous patterns. Such inferences must always be considered in its context, especially if words, tone and behaviour are recorded by individuals to be utilised in court proceedings. The Mental Capacity Act 2008 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (MCA) provides at s 4(3) that a lack of capacity cannot be established merely by (a) reference to a person’s age or appearance; or (b) a condition of the person, or an aspect of the person’s behaviour, which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about the person’s capacity. These provisions were useful reminders in my determination of the issues in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The plaintiff is a son of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (P). He alleged that P lacks mental capacity to make decisions that relate to his personal welfare and property and affairs. The plaintiff sought that documents executed by P after September 2017 be declared invalid on account of his mental incapacity. The concerns arose largely from finding out that P intended to marry the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, whom he has been in a romantic relationship with for more than 50 years. I dismissed the application and the plaintiff appeals against the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts forming the backdrop</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       P is 97 years of age. He set up a thriving chemical manufacturing company in the early 1960s. He remains a director of this company on his re-election in July 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       P was married in 1950 and from this union, he has 3 sons, the second son being the plaintiff. In 1971, he entered a romantic relationship with his secretary who is the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in these proceedings. From this relationship, they have a son. P’s wife came to know about the mistress but continued in the marriage with P. Both families stayed apart. P’s wife passed away in 2014 and some 2 years later, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant moved into P’s home where one of the plaintiff’s sons and his family also resided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In September 2017, P had a fall at his home, and the plaintiff submits that his father has not been cognitively the same ever since. In June 2021, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant informed the plaintiff’s older brother that she and P had decided to get married on 11 June 2021. This led to a meeting on 6 June 2021 between P and P’s sons from his marriage. The plaintiff alleged that P appeared unaware that he was going to get married. This meeting was recorded and a transcript of the audio recording presented in evidence. When the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant joined the meeting shortly after, the exchange became heated and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was alleged to have stated that she would leave the home if she could not get the blessing of the family and that the children from the first marriage could take care of P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> She shared that the reason for the marriage was because as a Catholic, she felt it necessary to take this step. After some time, P said that he too wanted to marry the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant which then brought the meeting to an abrupt end.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 7 June 2021, the plaintiff’s son lodged a caveat against the registration of the intended marriage. The grounds of the objection were that P “<em>is unable to make, commit and remember significant personal and corporate decisions even when in writing and based on personal communications with [P], he did not give consent to the notice of marriage filed in May 2021</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> P was very unhappy with the lodgement of the caveat. P and this grandson met on 8 June 2021. The grandson recorded this meeting without the consent of P and this was presented in evidence. The grandson was of the view that P could not recall that there was to be a marriage between him and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and even found difficulty remembering that there was a meeting that happened between P and his sons on 6 June 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The plaintiff claimed that he was concerned about the way P was speaking with regards the upcoming marriage and consulted a geriatrician, Dr carol Tan, to obtain her views on the mental capacity of P. The plaintiff provided the audio and video recordings and authorised her to review P’s medical records.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 13 June 2021, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant asked the plaintiff and his son to attend a meeting with P which she claimed was on P’s request. The plaintiff and his son did not attend but the plaintiff’s son wrote a letter dated 14 June 2021 instead saying why he did not attend. A letter was in turn received by the plaintiff’s son from P [Disinheritance Letter] referring to the caveat as “<em>utter nonsense</em>” and P informed that he had executed a codicil which sought to exclude the plaintiff and his son from P’s will unless the caveat was withdrawn and the plaintiff and his son stop falsely claiming that the P did not have the ability to make his own decisions. He also gave them a date by which the plaintiff’s son and family were to leave P’s home. In this Disinheritance Letter, P offered to meet the plaintiff and his son again on 14 June 2021. The plaintiff and his son chose not to meet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It was the plaintiff’s son’s position that the Disinheritance Letter was not written by P and that someone “<em>must have tricked or cajoled him into signing it</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, P appeared to have left his home, and a police report was filed as the family did not know where he was. On 15 June 2021, the plaintiff was informed that P was in his office. The plaintiff’s son wrote another letter to P stating that he did not believe the Disinheritance Letter was written by P, that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant prevented him from speaking to P and that he did not believe P understands the Disinheritance Letter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 16 June 2021, the plaintiff’s son received a handwritten letter from P stating that the former was ungrateful to have lodged a caveat and that if there were to be a meeting, P’s close friend (M) and his cousin (N) would have to be present. The plaintiff’s son and the plaintiff did not believe that this letter was written by P. Around the same time, a report by Dr Carol Tan was received which stated concerns about the mental capacity of P. She based her concerns on the recordings and brain imaging reports but said that “<em>I would strongly recommend that [P] be brought to see a medical specialist for appropriate assessment and care</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff then sought the opinion of a neurologist, Dr Calvin Fones, who was given similar material to base his opinion on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 18 June 2021, the plaintiff met with P at the latter’s office. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was present proceeded to call on M and N. Only N arrived shortly after. P was asked by the plaintiff if the Disinheritance Letter was fair and the plaintiff alleges that P did not answer. What P did say was that he was sad and he had built his company by himself without any money left to him by his father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 19 June 2021, the plaintiff’s son asked to meet with P through M. The plaintiff and his son then met with P. M and N were present. P read from his handwritten letter that was sent earlier and appeared to be angry. The plaintiff felt that P was not able to decide about the wedding but instead used words like “<em>I am greatly saddened</em>”, “<em>No one challenges me and my decisions</em>” and “<em>I was made to look like a bloody fool</em>” during this meeting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff claimed that P had no recollection of the Disinheritance Letter that he sent a few days earlier as he kept repeating that he would disinherit the plaintiff’s son even though this was made explicit in the Disinheritance Letter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 22 June 2021, the plaintiff received a report from Dr Fones who was of the view that P likely suffers from Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury and onset of this disorder was after the fall in September 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Dr Fones went on to speak of likely abuse of P and his inability to protect his interests. He also expressed concern that P had been deprived of contact with his family. It is unclear from the report who provided information on the concerns highlighted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After the present application was filed by the plaintiff in June 2021, P commenced S 744 against the plaintiff for the recovery of S$3.8 million allegedly extended by P’s company to the plaintiff and S 755 against the plaintiff’s son for civil trespass on account of the plaintiff’s son and his family changing the locks to Ps home and their refusal to vacate the home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the application before this court, a series of documents executed or actions done by P since his fall in September 2017 were challenged on the basis that P did not have the mental capacity to do so and the plaintiff sought declarations that these are accordingly invalid. This included:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The execution of a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in April 2019 where the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and a close friend (M) were appointed his donees;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The setting up of 2 trusts on 20 October 2019 where the shares in the chemical manufacturing business were transferred to the trusts and which will be used for the benefit of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, P’s children and grandchildren;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any alienation, encumbrance of any property owned by P directly, P’s companies and/or any trusts or the trusts referred to in (b) above;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The appointment of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P’s cousin (N) as directors of P’s personal investment holding company, where P was the sole shareholder and director. The appointment the plaintiff alleges, was not in keeping with P’s intentions over the past decades;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The appointment of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s son to the Board of Directors of the chemical manufacturing company which the plaintiff claimed was suspicious;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The execution of a codicil in June 2021;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The ability of P in his capacity as sole shareholder and director of his investment company to commence 2 suits (S 744 and 745) in September 2021 and the ability to instruct solicitors for this purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     P was made party to these proceedings after a contested application to determine his ability to participate in these proceedings without a litigation representative (summons 3276/2021) was successful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The plaintiff was of the view that medical opinion on P’s capacity was divergent and sought via prayer 1 of the present application, the engagement of medical specialists to provide what he saw as a more independent assessment of P. In this regard, 3 specialists, namely, Dr Chan Kin Ming (a geriatrician), Dr Michael Yap Hock Leong (a neurologist) and Dr Lim Yun Chin (a psychiatrist) were appointed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> These medical experts (JME) produced a joint report which essentially informed that P has the mental capacity to make his own decisions as it relates to his personal welfare and property and affairs and more specifically, had the capacity to execute the documents that were of concern to the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having received the JME report, the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the panel’s views and sought to cross-examine the JME (summons 2807/2024). Additionally, the plaintiff sought to have Dr Calvin Fones and Dr Carol Tan provide their views on the JME’s report (summons 2815/2024) and cross-examine 4 persons which included the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P. I permitted a concurrent hearing where questions could be posed to the JME and a clinical psychologist who administered a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) but dismissed the requests for Dr Fones and Dr Tan to provide their views on the JME’s report on account of the fact that the very appointment of the JME was to address the plaintiff’s concerns over what he saw as divergent medical opinion. I also dismissed the application for the cross-examination of the defendants largely on account of the numerous affidavits that had already been filed and the extensive medical evaluation of P’s capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Does P have the mental capacity to make decisions? </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     A statutory definition of mental incapacity is found at section 4(1) of the MCA. A person is said to lack capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. This embraces a functional component, that is, whether P is unable to make decisions on his own and a clinical component, which is that this inability stems from an impairment of the mind.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Section 5 of the Act informs of the need for an individual to be able to understand, retain, use or weigh relevant information in making decisions and then to communicate those decisions. Section 5(2) specifically provides that a person is not to be regarded as unable to understand the information relevant to a decision if the person is able to understand an explanation of it given to him in a way that is appropriate to his or her own circumstances (talking, sign language or any other means). Further, the fact that a person is able to retain the information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent the person from being regarded as able to make the decision.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> S 5(4) states that relevant information includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another or failing to make a decision.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Under s 19 (1) of the MCA, a court can make declarations as to whether a person has or lacks capacity to make decisions specified in the declarations. The plaintiff called for such declarations in relation to a wide variety of documents P had executed since September 2017.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The functional and clinical components were assessed by reference to the following evidence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Evidence of the plaintiff and P’s family </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was the position of the plaintiff that P has no capacity to make decisions on his own as it relates to his personal welfare and property and affairs and in particular, that P had no capacity to execute various documents after the injuries he sustained from his fall in September 2017. He based his position on:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     observations of P from September 2017 as compared to P’s words and actions prior to that date;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     what he perceived as a disconnect between what can be observed on the video recording of the examination of P by the JME and the JME’s findings presented in their report; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the medical reports of Dr Carol Tan and Dr Calvin Fones.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The position that the plaintiff took as regards the lack of capacity of P came only after he learnt that P wanted to marry the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in June 2021 while the premise on which he alleged that P lacks capacity is a fall P sustained in 2017. Despite this fall, the plaintiff and his son continued to work at the chemical company under the guidance of P without fear of any inability of P to guide them. In 2019 P appointed the plaintiff’s son as General Manager of the company as he wanted to give him an opportunity to lead the company.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> These decisions were not questioned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The lodgement of the caveat by the plaintiff’s son to stop the marriage between P and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant led to P executing a codicil to cut the plaintiff and his son out of his will should the plaintiff’s son choose not to remove the caveat. The court was informed that the caveat was in fact withdrawn in September 2025, prior to the resumption of the hearing before me on 9 October 2025. The reasons for the withdrawal are unclear. The defendants’ take the position that the concern was never about the marriage but rather more that the plaintiff and his son did not want to be cut off as beneficiaries of P’s estate. I make no finding on the plaintiff and his son’s motives. What is important however is that in withdrawing the caveat, the suggestion is that the plaintiff’s son no longer believes that P has no capacity to consent to marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     P in my view, was not acting out of character after his fall in September 2017 in ways that should cause concern of incapacity. In the past, he had expressed that he would ensure that the management of his businesses would be kept within the family. He assured financial security to the children from his marriage. This was said when his wife was alive and when the 2 families lived separately, without P showing any obvious favour of one over the other. After September 2017, P continued to care for his children from his marriage. This is seen in the provisions he made for all of them when he set up the 2 trusts and the provisions in his will. P even set up a separate trust for the eldest son. P did not want to cut his children off, simply that he wanted to cater for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant too. The relationship between P and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is not a brief affair that suggested a predatory attempt by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to consume the wealth of P. They have been together longer than most marriages last and from the union, they have a son who P appears to trust and wants to provide for too. In P’s words, “<em>After I had a fall in 2017, I decided to put my affairs in order and asked my lawyers to prepare documents as part of my estate planning. I alone decided the terms of my will and the trusts I had set. These decisions were mine to make. In my entire life as a successful businessman and community leader, I have never allowed anyone to make or question any of my decisions, whether business or personal. Not my late wife, [the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] or anybody. I was not about to start</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As for the plaintiff’s position that the JME’s findings were discordant with the recording of the examination, I found no basis for such a position. While I am in agreement that the court is not bound by the findings of the JME, I was guided by their views both in their report and their answers to questions posed by the plaintiff’s counsel. I was of the view that the explanations were largely satisfactory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I was concerned about the plaintiff’s dissatisfaction with medical assessments by doctors who had the opportunity to meet P and his heavy reliance on recordings of P to convince the court that P lacks capacity. On 6 June 2021, P was asleep when his sons approached him. P was forced to wake up so that he could address their questions on the intended marriage. He must have been disorientated and surprised. The subject was not something he appeared to want to talk about. P is hard of hearing and as the JME reported, does on occasion have short term memory lapses. The JME also spoke of how he took his time to respond which did not in their assessment relate to an inability to answer but in keeping with the way he tended to deflect questions until he is ready to answer them. There is in my view, very little that can be concluded from the audio recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The meeting between P and the plaintiff’s son on 8 June 2021 which was also recorded, does not in my view show P as someone unable to make decisions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The grandson produced the transcript to show that P was unaware of the marriage that was scheduled to take place on 11 June 2021 and that he did not appear to have the capacity to contract a marriage. I do not agree. I noted that there were certainly times when P seemed forgetful. This again appears aligned with the findings of the JME. However, his responses were cogent and clear in the main. Oftentimes the grandson appeared to be convincing his grandfather that the idea of marriage to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not something his grandfather agreed to or was even aware of and at other times he appears to be reminding P of what he had said in the past. When casual family conversations like this are recorded without the knowledge of the one being recorded, it lacks context and is of little probative. An example of the exchange which shows that despite the grandson’s attempts, P appears to genuinely want to and understand his decision to marry is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"17.74%\"><col width=\"82.26%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class=\"\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">P:</p> </td><td class=\"\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>So what do we want to do?

The question is whether these signal age related impairments or something more. Even when neurodegenerative illnesses are diagnosed, one cannot be quick to point to a lack of mental capacity. S 3(2) of the MCA provides that autonomy must be assumed. What needs to be exercised in cases where there is a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder however, is greater care when assessing such individuals<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> which require in my view, professional knowledge, skills and experience with patients who suffer from such illnesses. Indeed it was the plaintiff himself who recognised this need in seeking the appointment of the JME. The importance of the vast work of various doctors who had assessed P prior to the appointment of the JME and the work of the JME themselves, cannot in my view, be ignored or minimised in favour of what the plaintiff, his son and his other brothers perceive, especially considering their silence prior to the discovery of P’s intention to marry. Either they knew of his incapacity but chose to remain silent as many of P’s acts benefitted them <em>or</em> they have no real belief that P’s condition was anything other than age related mild cognitive impairment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Further evidence relied on by the plaintiff: Testimony of P’s friend</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The plaintiff relied on the evidence of a friend of P who was a former director of P’s company. This friend spoke of how P was inclined to include his son from his relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as a member of the company’s Board of Directors. P’s friend was not keen on such inclusion and advised P against it. During a meeting between P and his friend when the latter repeated his objection, he felt that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was likely to have heard the conversation. This was because the door to the room they were in was ajar and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in close proximity. The next day, he received a letter seeking that he cease working at the company. He eventually resigned after 11 years at the company and was of the view that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was behind the request for his resignation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     P’s friend gave in evidence that after P’s fall in 2017, he observed concerning behavioural changes. P appeared at times to forget things he may have spoken of previously. In particular, the friend found it incomprehensible that P did not appear to understand or react to the company being issued a heavy fine for a chlorine gas leak at a storage facility.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The incident occurred in September 2016 prior to P’s fall. In my view, if he had reacted then, it would be equally odd for P’s friend to expect P to react again at the hefty fine, imposed 2 years later. Regardless, I accepted the evidence of P’s friend insofar as it related to his observations of the difference in P’s behaviour before and after his fall in 2017. It is however not disputed that there was a brief period of time when P was recovering from his fall. From tests conducted over 2017 and 2018, P has from a medical standpoint, recovered. Additionally, this friend left the company in June 2019 making his observations limited. This witness is also an individual who had been asked to leave the company and he was of the view that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was behind it. The evidence should in my view be accorded less weight than the collective position of M, N and P’s solicitor for his estate matters, which is elaborated on later in these Grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (P) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that P had asked her to move in with him in 2016 so as to care for him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> She said that she did so out of love and care for him and there was no suggestion at the time from family members that P had lost his mental capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant spoke of how after P’s fall in September 2017, his neurosurgeon said that P was fit to travel. The couple flew to various places such as Japan and Hong Kong and 2 years later in 2019, further away to the U.S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant commented that the meeting between P and his sons on 6 June 2021 was confrontational and that the sons did not give P enough time to answer their questions nor did they take any step to assist P in answering the questions. She claimed that she too was “<em>bombarded with questions about why we had to get married</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     P was represented by counsel in these proceedings. His evidence is that he was hard of hearing and that his short-term memory was not good. He spoke of his recovery from his fall in September 2017. He said that “<em>despite these issues, I am of sound mind and possess mental capacity</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He spoke of M as his “<em>long time trusted friend and confidante</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, making his appointment as a co-executor of his will and co-donee of his LPA intentional. His appointment of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant similarly, is well in keeping with his choice of persons that he trusts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It was P’s position that he had discussed marriage to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant a few years prior to this litigation as the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant wanted to do the right thing from a religious standpoint although P “<em>considered us already husband and wife but I decided that I should put matters right and have [the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] officially recognised as my wife…..the only matter that stood in the way of the weeding was religion I am a staunch Buddhist….and wanted to die as Buddhist….As it turned out, I did not have to convert…[the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] did not coerce me in to marrying her</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     P spoke of how he was angry with the plaintiff’s son for having lodged a caveat and that to send him a message, he issued the Disinheritance Letter. He said that for all meetings with his sons or the grandson, he wanted either M or N to be present as he saw them as impartial and could act as his witness.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> P who acted in these proceedings without a litigation representative, articulated these views to his counsel in the preparation of his affidavits. There was nothing in evidence that suggested that these were not the expressed positions of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Evidence relied on by the Defendants: Testimonies of P’s close friend, a close relative and a solicitor who acted for P in estate planning efforts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The evidence of P’s close friend, M, who is an accountant by training, provided a rather more objective view of P’s capacity since 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Prior to his retirement, M spent about 38 years at a large company providing audit, tax and financial services and he got to know P sometime in 1985. He audited P’s company for more than 10 years and according to M, he was told by P that he trusted him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He spoke of how P started estate planning from 2018 and that this took about a year to complete. P was able to instruct his solicitor on estate planning matters. P called on his sons to hear his eventual decisions at a meeting on 8 November 2019 and read a note prepared by his solicitor. All his sons except for the plaintiff were present. M and the solicitor were present. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not. When the 3<sup>rd</sup> son questioned certain decisions and the legal advice provided, especially in relation to an alleged conflict of interest in appointing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as an executor of the will and a donee under the LPA, P was seen by M as having stood firm by his decisions. There was no application filed at the time for a declaration that the documents were invalid by reason of a lack of capacity. Even M had suggested that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant not be a co-donee under the LPA so as to minimise any tension between his first and second families, but P insisted on it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The absence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at this meeting militates against any suggestion of undue influence by the latter on the former’s decision-making process. P appears to know what he wants and why. As M stated, “<em>He then explained that [the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant] could be trusted, and he believed she would be guided by me if any problems relating to his estate came up. He trusted that I would make decisions on his behalf that he would agree with</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     P’s first cousin, N, held various positions within the civil service prior to his retirement and spoke of a close relationship with P. He shared how P was a doting and fair parent and grandparent and a man of strong character who would never allow anyone to make decisions on his behalf.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> He also gave in evidence that on finding out that a caveat was lodged by P’s grandson, P was very angry. N and his wife accompanied P and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the Registry of Marriages (ROM) on P’s insistence. P and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant spoke to the Registrar in private and informed N that the Registrar could not decide on whether the marriage licence could be issued on account of the allegations in the caveat. N also gave evidence that P was very angry that the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s son chose not to meet him on 14 June 2021 and that he was not willing to accept a request by the plaintiff’s son’s to meet P at a location other than P’s office. N confirmed that P instructed his lawyers to issue the eviction letter for the grandson and his family to leave P’s home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The solicitor engaged to handle P’s estate planning matters is a senior partner and Co-Head of his firm’s Trust, Estates and Wealth Preservation practice. He spoke of how he met P sometime in August 2018. Most of the meetings with P took place in P’s office. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was largely absent during the meetings and if she happened to be present, P did not seek her views. The solicitor informed that P did however seek the views of M.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The solicitor stated that “<em>From my observations of [P] over the years and from the meetings I attended with [P] and [M], it was clear to me that [P] knew what he was doing. While he may have sought [M’s] opinion at times, ultimately he was the one that made the decisions</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The solicitor ensured that medical assessments supported the ability of P to execute documents relating to his estate and the solicitor was confident arising from his own observations and the medical assessments, to issue the LPA certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     P appeared to have formed the intention to marry the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and intended to execute the codicil as a response to what he saw as his grandson’s overreach in filing the caveat. The solicitor who handled P’s estate planning matters took the cautionary step of obtaining medical assessments even though he was of the view that P “<em>was alert, and able to appreciate and understand all the issues and documents that were discussed. [P] was very engaged at all our meetings and clear in instructing me on the terms of the new will, lasting power of attorney (LPA) and trusts that he wanted to set up and/or execute. Based on my observations of [P’s] behaviour during our meetings, I never doubted that [P] possessed mental capacity to make decisions and give me instructions regarding his property and affairs</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> There was no real challenge mounted against the observations of the solicitor and the assessments of the doctors for purposes of executing the estate planning documents other than the continued perception that it was implausible that P could have the capacity to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The weight of the evidence from M, N and P’s solicitor favoured a conclusion that P had the mental capacity to execute the documents in question despite the fact that P took time to respond, had short term memory losses and needed assistance at times. It bears repeating that the philosophy behind the MCA is to protect the interests of those who find their mental capacity impaired and this would include taking all reasonable steps to ascertain their true intentions, in the face of such impairment. Mental impairments are much like physical injuries. One may not be able to kick a ball forcefully with an injured ankle but one may still be able to kick it well. More importantly, the leg has not lost all utility. s 3(2) of the MCA provides that “<em>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help the person to do so have been taken without success</em>”. Any step taken by P’s friends or family to have him understand or remember something that was said in the past or articulate his views, are not in themselves reasons to conclude a lack of capacity. It is whether <em>with</em> such efforts, P is able to understand, remember and articulate. In this case, I did not doubt he could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Medical History and the Evidence of the JME </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The 3 doctors appointed to assess the capacity of P presented their findings in a report dated 26 April 2024. The purpose of their appointment was to determine whether P has mental impairment based on observable symptoms and any other diagnostic systems available and if so what the impairment is, what effect it has on his cognitive abilities and when it began to have such effect. In the event P was determined to suffer from a mental impairment to make decisions in relation to his personal welfare and property and affairs, the JME was asked to provide an opinion on his mental capacity in relation to the documents identified at paragraph 15 of these Grounds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The JME relied on volumes of documents which included medical reports from other doctors who had assessed P, the audio recording of the meeting between P and his sons on 6 June 2021, the JME interview of P held at P’s office on 3 August 2023 and the video and transcript of this, interviews with a Catholic priest who met with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P (to discuss the possibility of marriage in a Catholic church), interviews with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and her son, the plaintiff, his younger brother, the plaintiff’s son and M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The medical history of P was instructive to my determination. I had no cause to reject the positions expressed by the doctors. There was no suggestion of bias, a lack of robustness in approach or analysis nor any material inconsistency across the reports. The various medical doctors and the neuropsychologist who saw P prior to the JME had the benefit of examining P at the time the various documents were executed. This would provide the best evidence of the state of P’s health at the relevant period.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The JME themselves were of the view, correctly in my mind, that the execution of documents contemporaneously or shortly after mental examinations offer the best evidence of health when they said “<em>…we realise that, prior to every major decision that he made, he actually saw someone who assessed him. And that would have been the most accurate, because it is difficult for us to examine him several years later to do a retrospective estimate</em>…”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     After P’s fall in September 2017, he was diagnosed as having suffered traumatic subdural haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage. A doctor administered Abbreviated Mental Tests (AMT) and Chinese Mini-Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) on 4 occasions between 25 September 2017 and 15 January 2018 which showed gradual improvement. The January 2018 AMT score was 9 where normal cognitive functioning is a score of 8 and above. The CMMSE score in January 2018 was 21 where normal cognition is any score from 22. The doctor referred him to a psychiatrist to evaluate P’s mental capacity to execute a LPA. The assessment by this psychiatrist was conducted on 7 March 2019 and he opined that although short-term memory showed a mild impairment, P had the capacity to make the LPA. Further assessments were done by this psychiatrist on 23 July 2021and 12 October 2021 for the purpose of making a will and similarly, the psychiatrist confirmed capacity. He also assessed P for the purposes of ascertaining his ability to conduct legal proceedings relating to his demand that the plaintiff return S$3.8 million to P and evicting the plaintiff’s son from P’s residence. P articulated various reasons for each of the decisions which the psychiatrist found to be cogent and which indicated that P had the mental capacity to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The psychiatrist referred P to a neuropsychologist for “cognitive characterisation and mental capacity evaluation for the purpose of his intention to sign legal documents relating to his Will, Trust Deed and Deed of Gift”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The assessment was conducted on 1 October 2019 and while highlighting that P’s cognitive profile pattern suggested possible mild vascular neurocognitive disorder without significant behavioural disturbance, it was the neuropsychologist’s position that P had sufficient intellectual and cognitive capacity to make informed decisions regarding his legacy planning and distribution of family assets independently. “<em>P clearly and consistently repeated key information, and his broad intentions about the distribution of his inheritance</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> A second evaluation was conducted on 8 August 2020 to determine if P could decide on the transfer of assets into his Trust. Again, apart from occasional memory lapses, the neuropsychologist was able to conclude from P’s responses which included P’s ability to seek clarification of matters which were relevant to the decision to transfer his assets into his Trust, that he possessed the capacity to make the necessary decisions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Further assessments were conducted on 10 June 2021 to determine the capacity of P to execute his codicil. It was the neuropsychologist’s position that P had provided “<em>consistent, logical and reasonable responses with robustness, lucidity, and clarity” on the intended amendments to the will</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Further reports by 3 other doctors for assessments done on different dates were submitted to support the application of P to participate in the present proceedings without a litigation representative. A separate court allowed the application in no small part due to the fact that the doctors were all of the view that P had the capacity to act without a litigation representative, to appoint counsel, execute letters and even make decisions on his personal welfare which embraced aspects such as the consent to marry. I was mindful that there was an apparent difference between the diagnoses of 2 of the doctors. One who conducted tests on 21 and 22 July 2021 was of the view that P suffered from mild cognitive impairment while the other who conducted his assessments on 4 August 2021 and 25 August 2021, which included administering the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on which he scored 18/30, was of the view that P qualified for a diagnosis of dementia with mild severity, predominantly affecting his short-term memory recall. Given that the scope of their assessment was largely to consider P’s capacity to conduct court proceedings by himself and their confirmation of P’s ability in this regard, I looked to the other evidence to identify if there was any cause for concern in this apparent difference to issues beyond participation in court proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The only doctors who appear to fundamentally differ in their assessments of the capacity of P to make decisions on his personal welfare, property and affairs were Dr Carol Tan and Dr Calvin Fones. They were also the only doctors who did not meet with P but reviewed the audio and video recordings, medical reports, Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reports. Dr Carol Tan did not rule out the possibility of recovery and Dr Fones expressed that it is “<em>imperative for P to undergo an assessment of his mental capacity</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In other words, even the reports by Dr Tan and Dr Fones which gave the plaintiff concern over P’s mental health do not provide evidence that P lacked mental capacity but that more needed to be done for a proper assessment. They appear to recognise the limitation of “desktop opinions”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     During the JME’s interview with P, he obtained a score of 20/30 on the MMSE. Clinical observations were documented by the JME. While recognising that at times P took a longer time to reply, if at all, and made “irrelevant utterances”, it appeared to the JME that P wanted to exercise caution and deliberation before responding and he tended to say things to deflect from having to answer until he was ready. He often relied on humour to give him that time. His answers to various questions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> were of a nature that enabled the JME to conclude that P had the ability to understand, retain, use or weigh his decisions before communicating them. He spoke of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant favourably and viewed the family’s resistance to his marriage as one coloured by financial concerns. He said “<em>I’ve given them everything, yet they are not satisfied, yet they want to bite the hand that feeds them</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     While the JME did speak to the parties and the larger family, it had less significance than the statements of M, if only for the fact that the others come into the interview space with personal agendas. M had little to gain from providing the JME and the court, his observations. He shared that P did not trust his children and that a lot of money had been lost by his eldest son and the plaintiff who are discharged bankrupts. It was M’s position that P thought of his son with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as capable of managing P’s business but that this son did not want to be involved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While a decline in short term memory and slower processing speed were noted by the JME, the unanimous opinion of the JME was that P suffers from mild cognitive impairment and that the deterioration in his cognition could be attributed to a combination of old age, severe hearing impairment and a sequalae of his head injury as a result of the fall. It was the view of the JME that P had and still has the mental capacity for the specific tasks identified and that this conclusion was derived from the interview with him, the medical reports and information gleaned from interviews with other relevant individuals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Under questioning by the plaintiff’s counsel, the JME explained that when one speaks of memory loss, it can be subjective, objective or because of mild cognitive impairment. In the case of mild cognitive impairment, age related memory impairment is medically recognised and the doctors opined that “<em>there is nothing wrong with the person</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> When there is cognitive impairment, dementia could be an alternative diagnosis. Dementia is an umbrella term covering various conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease and Vascular Dementia and varying degrees within these varied conditions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The JME referred to MMSE scores, medical reports from previous doctors who had treated and/or assessed P in the past and took great pains to explain that “<em>Other than scores, clinical judgment – from perspective of 3 professors in different areas</em>” guided them to their conclusion. They confirmed that their conclusion was unanimous<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“[P’s] memory only one domain affected in cognitive impairment – if gone from mild cognitive impairment to mild dementia – there would be other tell tale signs….All three of us have different specialities of brain – geriatrician, neurologist and psychiatrist, we all see a lot of patients with dementia. And it’s obvious to the three of us, he is not demented, but only mild cognitive impairment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The JME also emphasised that they were strict with the allocation of scores for the tests that they administered. As an example, when P was asked to fold a piece of paper and place it on the floor, he chose not to place it on the floor and questioned its prudence as it would be a waste of the paper. Even though P had a good reason in the JME’s view, for not placing the paper on the floor, they did not give him a mark on account of him not complying with the instructions strictly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Another test was to determine P’s attention and mental calculation skills. To prevent any possibility of coaching, the JME asked that he subtract 7 from 80 instead of 100 which is what would typically happen during such tests, and to continue to subtract 7 from each answer provided. When the plaintiff’s counsel questioned why the answer given by P was written for him, the JME pointed out accurately that in assessing mental capacity, reasonable assistance was to be afforded to the person being assessed, so long as they do not inadvertently substitute answers on behalf of P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> They emphasised that the answer was given by P and it was written down for him in order to assist him to do the next mental calculation which was well within the idea of reasonable assistance. I accepted this position. If the test was to determine attention and mental calculation, writing down the answers given appears well in order to support the assessment of a 97-year-old man.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The JME was also questioned about P’s behaviour during the time he was examined by the JME and suggested that P needed a lot of assistance to orientate himself to where he was and why. P had also asked if the JME and the psychologist present were lawyers. The JME was of the view that he wanted to protect himself given his often-expressed distrust of lawyers. The JME explained that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>Because we started off with the premise that he already has mild cognitive impairment – so whatever – it will take a bit of longer time for him to fully understand what is happening, what’s the purpose, and for forth. So this reminding is also part of the process of helping him, assisting him so that, you know, as far as we are concerned, so that he can be cooperative during the assessment</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>I need to add that what Dr Chan has said, our impression was we are dealing with a very wily, elderly Chinese gentleman – whatever we thought, whatever reserve, whatever cognitive reserve that he has, he’s a guy who can use it to his advantage. There are times when we think that the longer time to reply, because of his memory impairment, the delay in memory recall. And he uses this, we think. As a strategy by deflecting it, making jokes, and then when he got the answer right, he answered. So again, this reinforces the notion that the longer time to reply may be part of a strategy. Maybe he actually ought to deliberate. Earlier, we say he’s preamble in this whole report was, I need to protect myself. I don’t think he’s comfortable with 4 people looking at him, because he was looking at each one of us before he answers. So he was assessing us, even as he thought that we were asking him</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The JME also spoke of the long pause and emotions that P displayed when he was reminded of the Disinheritance Letter. By P sharing that his grandson had failed to meet him, it was the opinion of the JME that this displayed an appropriate response on being reminded of the Disinheritance Letter. The JME shared that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>If you have not faced dementia patients and asked them questions, then you won’t understand what we’re trying to say…..The way dementia patients respond, no way this gentleman responded, the way you see on the video, that a – that a dementia patient does not exhibit this detail of ability, to manoeuvre, you know…when gave inheritance letter – long pause - then answer a few steps ahead – “He did not want to meet me. Why?” 2 days ago he wrote to grandson – come and meet me let him come again – 4 o’clock – didn’t come – so that sets off the disinheritance letter</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The responses of the JME under questioning provided clarity on the probable reasons P acted or responded in the ways he did which the plaintiff viewed as indicative of P’s lack of capacity. I was of the view that the responses were reasonable. For example, there was an incident in May 2018 where P had allegedly groped his grandson’s wife. The JME was of the view that this was probable after suffering the fall in September 2017 as the injuries sustained could result in disinhibition for a period. This did not affect his capacity to decide his own affairs. They also clarified that P did not suffer from paranoia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> and that even if P made a mistake in the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s son’s motivations in preventing the marriage, this would not affect the assessment of P’s cognitive ability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The plaintiff suggested that the JME was somewhat partial towards P and disagreed with the JME’s interpretation of P’s words and actions as suggestive of a man with capacity. While I accept that doctors in the mental health arena can find themselves subconsciously concluding a diagnosis on a subjective reading of their patients, I could not conclude that the JME was mistaken in their assessment or that it fell short in any material way. They worked with a lot of material. P was expressing himself in ways not typical of patients with dementia. He could even articulate that “<em>I had given them everything and yet they are not satisfied</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> when asked about the disinheritance and the motives of the plaintiff and grandson in stopping him from entering into a union with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The very appointment of the JME was on account of the vast amount of evidence supporting P’s ability to execute the documents in question. When the JME’s position aligned with that evidence, the position the plaintiff took was that the JME’s report cannot be relied on. The JME was a panel comprising doctors from 3 relevant and interrelated areas in geriatric health, and they collectively concluded, from the standpoint of geriatric psychiatry and neurology, that P continues to have mental capacity today. The 3 doctors were not related to the parties nor would they benefit from their findings. When we speak of the clinical component involved in mental capacity assessments, it is important to appreciate the need for clinical judgment arising from personal contact with patients. While mental assessment tests like the MMSE and MoCA are important tools and provide a start point to assessments, they are simple tools, unable to replace good doctor-patient interaction which remains the cornerstone of sound medical judgments. I had no doubt that the JME provided the correct analysis of the state of P’s mental health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The plaintiff also took issue with the presence of a clinical psychologist at the JME’s interview of P and who had administered the MMSE, on the basis that this was only made known to him when the recording of the session was made available. He sought to cross-examine the JME and Ms Tan and I had permitted instead that all be present at a concurrent hearing. The plaintiff however chose not to call on Ms Tan to attend this hearing, which he stated was due to the costs that would be incurred. In any event, while the test administered may have guided the doctors, its utility is low.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     What the plaintiff appears to be suggesting is that all the doctors who personally assessed P were wrong in their conclusions and so too the JME who were brought in on his request. While I appreciate the perspective of the plaintiff who has witnessed his father move from a robust and active businessman to a physically vulnerable 97-year-old, who takes his time to speak and appears to ask many questions, this deterioration can be safely attributed to age related impairment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The plaintiff’s counsel took the position that even if the JME’s assessment were to be accepted, it did not address the capacity of P in executing each of the documents at the time each was executed. I was of the view that a finding of capacity today to make decisions on all matters would necessarily mean that the court no longer needed to look at whether there was capacity to make a decision at a particular point in time in relation to a particular document or action. In cases of dementia, this would be an important exercise given that there will be periods of lucidity and a lack of it. In any event, the assessments of doctors prior to the appointment of the JME pointed to P’s ability to execute the various documents in question. There was no evidence that cast doubt on the sufficiency of these assessments at various points in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     It was also in my view necessary to suspend judgment on why a 97-year-old would want to remarry. It is about respecting choices if capacity is established. The position of his children from the first marriage can easily be appreciated. Their mother, P’s wife, has passed away and she lived in the knowledge that her husband was having an extramarital affair for the larger part of her marriage to him. However, on P’s capacity to decide how he wanted to lead his life, there is nothing unusual about his decision to marry after his wife’s passing. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P have been in a relationship for decades. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant looks after P although there was some dispute on who the primary caregiver is. Given the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she wanted to marry P because of her faith and the position of P that the only thing that stood in his way was his resistance to any idea that he may have to convert to Catholicism shows a man who was well able to decide for himself, what he wants to do and conversely, what he was not prepared to do. The JME also commented that P’s insistence that he did not want to change his religion helped put to rest any suggestion that he was capable of being unduly influenced to act in ways that did not reflect his wishes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The JME on being asked about the positions taken by Dr Carol Tan and Dr Calvin Fones, expressed that it was entirely possible to conclude in the way they did because they were presented with audio recordings and scans where there were long pauses and graphic images, respectively. Dr Tan and Dr Fones did not see P and they did not assess P. Little weight can be attached to their evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Was there Undue Influence exerted by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Although the Originating Summons (Amendment No.5) did not specifically seek a declaration that the documents executed by P after September 2017 be set aside or invalidated on account of undue influence exerted by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff’s counsel made submissions to this effect.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> In <b><em>Re BKR</em></b> the court provided that the proven or potential presence of undue influence is relevant to the issue of mental capacity in three ways:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>First, it is material whether P is able to retain, understand or use the information that relates to whether there might be undue influence being applied, for instance whether P can understand that a third person may have interests opposed to his; and if not, whether that inability is cause by a mental impairment.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Second it much be considered whether P’s susceptibility to undue influence is caused by mental impairment; if so, and if the result of such undue influence is that P’s will is so overborne that he is unable to use and weigh information relevant to the decisions in question, P would be unable to make decisions because of mental impairment.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>The third way in which undue influence is relevant is that it might mean that P cannot realistically hope to obtain assistance in making decisions, In such a situation, P may be found to lack capacity because of a mental impairment operating together with the lack of assistance”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Relying on <b><em>BUV</em></b> v <b><em>BUU &amp; UWP</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> where undue influence was established, the plaintiff submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P were constant companions thus creating a presumption of undue influence and that the execution of legal documents after 2017 called for explanations that were not forthcoming. I did not agree. While the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and P were clearly very close, P was not dependent nor vulnerable. In fact at many points in time, he showed himself to be someone who will not retract from a position once he made up his mind. Even when his close friend M suggested that he choose someone other than the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as donee under the LPA, he rejected it. M was also present at the meetings P had with his solicitor who assisted in matters relating to P’s estate planning and confirmed P’s understanding of the documents that were executed. N followed P and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the ROM where P spoke with the Registrar after the caveat was lodged indicating P’s own resolve and desire to marry the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The JME’s observations were also that P was a man who knew what he wants and would not change his mind easily. The execution of the legal documents was done only after medical assessments were made of P’s capacity to do so and P was legally represented through the course of estate planning which took some time to complete. To suggest that explanations were not forthcoming on the reasons for the execution of legal documents after September 2017 goes against the collective tone of the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     When P chose many decades ago to start an extramarital relationship with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the children from his first marriage must have felt the pain of their mother (P’s wife) and perhaps, I speculate, a larger sense of consternation that their father did not or could not see his children as sufficient reason to maintain fidelity. At the heart of the application before the court is the expression of that hurt decades later when P has chosen to marry again. It is not implausible that they were concerned about the financial consequences on them as children of P. I did not agree however that the plaintiff was motivated by greed in bringing this action but rather more that he, his brothers and one of his sons felt that P should not make a decision that would change the status quo. There were always 2 families that were kept distinct and apart and provided for by P with the implicit assurance that his extramarital affair would not alter the balance he preserved between the 2 families.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The duty of this court is to allow P’s decisions to be respected and, in this regard, to ascertain whether it was in fact P’s wishes that were articulated. It is not the morality of his decisions nor even the logic of the same although a lack of logic could certainly in the context of other facts, suggest mental incapacity. This case demonstrates that advanced age and atypical decisions are not reasons in themselves to dismiss decisions if they were made with sound capacity. Indeed a 97-year-old may wish to marry the lady he has been with for more than 50 years and who wishes to be with him. He may choose to arrange his financial affairs to provide for her and their son and to deny others. It would not be for this court to say that he cannot do so if these are choices made freely and with necessary capacity, even if arguably, social constructs prevent such contemplation. Indeed, “<em>man is condemned to be free</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p

On that occasion, they made cross-applications to vary an order relating to ancillary matters made in August 2023 (“<b>2023 Order</b>”). On 23 December 2024, I made, among others, the following orders (“<b>2024 Order</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I allowed the Plaintiff’s application that the matrimonial home be sold on the <em>open market within six months</em> (“<b>Sale Clause</b>”) and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I dismissed the Defendant’s application for the Plaintiff to transfer his share in the matrimonial home to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Sale Clause has become unworkable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Under the Sale Clause, the matrimonial home was to be sold by June 2025. This did not occur. This is because the Defendant appealed against the 2024 Order and the appeal was heard only in August 2025. It was dismissed. In other words, by the time the appeal process concluded, the deadline for the sale of the home had lapsed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Variation to restore the workability of the Sale Clause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To restore the workability of the Sale Clause, the parties filed variation applications under s 112(4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff proposes for the clause to be varied such that the deadline for the sale of the matrimonial home is extended by nine months. The Defendant does not object to this variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Additionally, the Plaintiff proposes that the following provision be inserted into the Sale Clause in case the Defendant, who is currently residing in the matrimonial home, is obstructive in his efforts to market and sell the home:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The Defendant] shall cooperate with the [Plaintiff] and/or his agents for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat, including allowing the [Plaintiff] and/or his agents access to the Matrimonial Flat for the purpose of marketing and effecting the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I allow the Plaintiff’s proposed variations in [6] and [7] above. They do no more than is necessary to give practical effect to the original intent of the Sale Clause – which is for the property to be sold on the open market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key issue for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Next, I turn to the Defendant’s application. She proposes that the Sale Clause be varied as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That she be given the right of first option (exercisable within six months) to take over the matrimonial home at $513,000; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the home be sold on the open market only if the option is not exercised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Plaintiff strongly objects to the Defendant’s proposal. He seeks the Sale Clause to be implemented in the manner as originally intended – sale of the home on the open market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The key issue is therefore whether I should accede to the Defendant’s proposed variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I had previously summarised the principles governing variation under s 112(4) when making the 2024 Order: see <em>WQF v WQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32687-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 113</a> (“<b><em>WQF</em></b>”) at [7] to [14]. I recap the essential points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>When the variation power is available</em>. Where a court order remains unimplemented, the power to vary under s 112(4) is exercised only in limited instances – where the order was unworkable to begin with or has become unworkable due to new circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Approach</em>. The variation power under s 112(4) is not a license to re-write a court order. A court will proceed on the premise that the original order is just and equitable and will not allow its terms to be re-litigated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>How the power is to be exercised</em>. To preserve the integrity and finality of an order, a variation ought to be surgical and exercised with a light touch. It should reflect the intent of the original order, preserve the parties’ substantive rights and obligations, and go no further than is necessary to restore the order’s workability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Applying these principles, I dismiss the Defendant’s proposed variation. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14      <em>First</em>, the Defendant’s proposal is not a limited variation directed at making the Sale Clause workable. It is a substantive re-writing of the clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <em>Second</em>, the intent of the Sale Clause is for the matrimonial home to be sold on the open market. The Defendant’s proposal substitutes that with a materially different approach – transfer the home to her at a stated price, subject to a significant waiting period. That is not “making workable” what was ordered; it is <em>changing</em> what was ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <em>Third</em>, the Defendant’s proposal substantially alters the Plaintiff’s rights and exposes him to significant risks that are not present under the Sale Clause. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The proposal imposes several constraints on the Plaintiff. <em>One</em>, he will receive a fix amount of $513,000 from the division of matrimonial home. <em>Two</em>, this amount is payable only if the Defendant exercises her right of first option. <em>Three</em>, the Plaintiff must wait for six months before knowing whether she will do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite the constraints, the Defendant submits that her proposal benefits the Plaintiff because it avoids (i) conveyancing and property agent’s fees, (ii) the uncertainty of finding an open-market buyer at a mutually agreeable price, and (iii) the prospect of her seeking higher maintenance from him if she cannot afford rental expenses for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I do not accept that these benefits justify the Defendant’s proposal. They understate the following real and significant risks to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The $513,000 figure is based on an October 2025 valuation of the matrimonial home at $950,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> An open-market sale may result in a sale price that exceeds the valuation price. The Defendant’s proposal would thus deny the Plaintiff the opportunity of securing a higher amount from the home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Defendant plans to sell her Parc Riviera property to raise the $513,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It is uncertain whether she can achieve this. Between August 2025 (when her appeal was dismissed) and the present decision (January 2026), she has had a substantial period to put her plan into effect. Yet, there is no cogent evidence that she has secured a firm offer, that her reserve price is realistic and can be met by the market, or that the Parc Riveira property can be sold and the transfer completed within the option period for the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       If the Defendant cannot exercise her option, the Plaintiff’s ability to market and complete the sale of the matrimonial home thereafter will be constrained by a shortened runway – three months instead of nine months. This materially increases the risk of further delay and another round of variation applications. The court should not adopt a “variation” that is apt to generate fresh applications and prolong the implementation of the Sale Clause when there is already a workable mechanism for dealing with the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17      <em>Fourth</em>, the Defendant has not demonstrated a compelling need to substantially rewrite the Sale Clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Her case is essentially that an open-market sale will be detrimental to her and the child, and that it would be preferable for her to retain the matrimonial home. According to her –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       They are currently residing at the home and her Parc Riviera property is “unsuitable for her accommodation”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       She is precluded from buying a HDB resale flat for 15 months because she owns a private property (the Parc Riviera property).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       She cannot not afford to buy a private property of “sufficient size”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In my view, the Defendant has not clearly explained why the alternatives open to her do not adequately address the alleged detriment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       She asserts that the Parc Riviera property is “unsuitable” because it is a one-bedder. However, she does not explain, with clarity or evidence, why she and a 13-year-old child cannot reside there at least as an interim measure, pending the making of longer-term housing arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Defendant also asserts she would have to rent another premise if the matrimonial home is sold. There is no evidence to show that she cannot afford to do so. For this purpose, she has assets, including the Parc Riveira property. There are also the sale proceeds from the matrimonial home. On her own figures, the home is valued at $950,000. If sold at that valuation, and if she receives 46% of the sale price,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> her share would be $437,000 before accounting for any deductions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Defendant points to a 15-month restriction on purchasing an HDB resale flat due to her ownership of private property. However, she has not shown why this waiting period would be highly prejudicial to the child or would render the Sale Clause practically incapable of implementation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In stating the above, I do not intend to minimise the practical difficulties to the Defendant posed by the sale of the matrimonial home. I am simply highlighting that the Defendant’s <em>preference is not the test</em> for variation, and inconvenience to her, without more, does not justify recasting the decision deliberately taken in the Sale Clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To support her case, the Defendant relies on <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/30134-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 1 SLR 1253</a> (“<b><em>VWM</em></b>”) where the matrimonial home was ordered to be transferred to the wife instead of being dealt with in accordance with the lower court’s order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span><em>VWM</em> does not assist her. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>VWM</em> involved an <em>appeal</em> on the merits of the division of matrimonial assets by the lower courts. It did not concern the variation of an unimplemented order, and it was not decided within the legal framework that governs variation of court orders under s 112(4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Further, the factual matrix in <em>VWM</em> is materially different. The lower courts had ordered the matrimonial flat to be returned to HDB, and the appellate court was concerned that this would compel the caregiving parent to apply for a HDB flat afresh, wait for its allocation, and face the risk that the flat will be at a different location – outcomes which the appellate court found were not in the children’s interests. These concerns do not apply in the present case as the Defendant has options other than applying for a HDB flat. She can stay in the Parc Riveira property or rented premises. She can also buy a resale HDB flat: see [17] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, the appellate court found that the husband would not have suffered any real prejudice if the flat was transferred to the wife instead: judgement at [15] read with [6]. The same cannot be said for the Plaintiff in the present case: see [16] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18      <em>Finally</em>, the Defendant’s proposed variation is, in substance, an attempt to raise an issue that has already been litigated and rejected by two different courts. In December 2024, she sought a transfer of the matrimonial home to her (in exchange for payment arrangements and other concessions): <em>WQF</em> at [5(b)]. I rejected that request: <em>WQF</em> at [4] and [18] to [20]. She appealed. The High Court also rejected her challenge: HCF/DCA 1/2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the above reasons –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I dismiss the Defendant’s application in FC/SUM 2689 of 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I allow Prayers 1 and 2 of Plaintiff’s application in FC/D OADV 704 of 2025. As for Prayer 3, I order that the Defendant is to pay costs to the Plaintiff at $1,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Before concluding, I make three observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Plaintiff has chosen to reject the Defendant’s proposed variation. He is legally entitled to do so. This is so even if the Defendant believes that there are better alternatives to dealing with the matrimonial home. A party who insists on the implementation of a subsisting court order acts within his or her rights. The court’s task on a variation application under s 112(4) is not to select the most attractive alternative, but to determine whether the strict legal threshold for variation has been met. Where the answer is no, the proper course is to give effect to the order as made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Defendant submits that the court should “take a therapeutic approach”, “assist parties to move on with their lives”, and therefore grant her application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I do not accept that therapeutic considerations can, of themselves, supply the legal basis to vary a concluded order under s 112(4). Therapeutic justice may properly inform the court’s manner of engagement with parties and the management of proceedings. It however operates “within the framework of the law”: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [28]; <em>WSY v WSX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31484-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 21</a> at [79] and [80]; Practice Directions 2024 at [90B(1)]. Therapeutic justice does not displace the settled variation principles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the strict principles governing the variation of court orders under s 112(4) should not be seen as obstacles to justice. They reflect the rule of law – by ensuring that court orders provide certainty and closure. If the court were to permit parties to reopen and materially revise concluded terms under the label of “variation” whenever an alternative seems preferable, two consequences follow. <em>One</em>, it would allow a dissatisfied party (i) to mount a collateral attack on the merits of the order without pursuing the proper appellate route, or (ii) to re-litigate a matter which has failed on appeal. <em>Two</em>, it would defeat the legitimate expectation of the other party who has arranged his or her affairs on the basis that the order is final. For these reasons, the variation jurisdiction under s 112(4) is exercised cautiously and sparingly – and is confined to only what is necessary to address the circumstances that have rendered the original order practically incapable of implementation.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>OADV 704/2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 23.01.26 at [22], [23], [24(d)] and [31(a)(ii)];

An Interim Judgement (IJ) was issued in 2022 dissolving the marriage. After what appears to be significant attempts at mediation, the parties agreed on the care arrangements for their daughter which is reflected in a consent order dated 3 April 2023. The daughter was 5 years old at the time. In 2024, both parties sought variation of the consent order, principally as it relates to issues of custody, care and control of their child. Having heard from the parties and having had the opportunity to speak with the child, I found no reason to change the terms of the order and accordingly dismissed the applications save that I no longer felt it necessary that the husband place a deposit of S$20 000 with his solicitors each time he takes his child overseas nor the need for the wife to retain all of the child’s passports. The wife appeals against all orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The husband is 60 years of age, a permanent resident in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and was at the time of the applications before me, retrenched from his position as a Director of Accounting for Sustainability at a company providing workforce solutions. He has since taken on an adjunct teaching position at a local university. He shared that with the income he receives from teaching, his savings and inheritance received from his late father, he is financially stable and does not at this time of his life need to take on another job. The wife is 50 years old and a Singaporean. She works part-time as a lecturer at a local polytechnic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties were blessed with a child after 8 years of marriage and both agreed that they were equal partners in the care of their daughter in the early years of the child’s life. The marriage faced difficulties and in 2021 the husband left the home. They were living with the wife’s parents at that time. He filed for divorce in 2022. Through a series of mediation sessions, the parties agreed to the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><em>Order of Court dated 3/4/2023</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_1\"></a>1.     Parties shall have joint custody of the only child of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2\"></a>2.     Parties shall have shared care and control of the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_a\"></a>(a)        <b><em>Until August 2024</em></b>, the father shall have care of the child on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to Monday (when the child is dropped off at school);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_b\"></a>(b)       The mother shall have care of the child for the remaining period of the week;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The father shall have liberty to travel with the child for 18 days in July 2023, 2 weeks in February/early March 2024 (after Lunar New Year) and 3 weeks in July 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_d\"></a>(d)        <b><em>From August 2024</em></b>, the father shall have care and control of the child from Saturdays at 2 p.m. to Tuesday mornings when she is dropped off at school;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_e\"></a>(e)       The mother shall have care of the daughter for the remaining period of the week;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_f\"></a>(f)       The parties agree to attend co-parenting counselling after the date of this Order with the child or any other independent counsellor mutually agreed upon between the parties.

Further, parties shall share the costs of the co-parenting counselling equally; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_2-p3_g\"></a>(g)       The child’s school holidays shall be split equally between the parties, with parties having the liberty to bring the child overseas during their respective shares of the school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_3\"></a>3.     There will be no make-up access should either party miss their time with their child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_4\"></a>4.     Unless mutually agreed between the parties, neither party shall enlist the assistance of non-family members to care for the child during their time with her and neither party shall place the child ins afterschool care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_5\"></a>5.     Where either party travels overseas with the child, the travelling party shall provide the non-travelling party with prior notice of at least one (1) month, and shall also provide the non-travelling party details of the trip, including but not limited to flights, itinerary and contact details.

The defendant shall release the child’s Singapore passport to the plaintiff at least 7 days prior to the father’s intended travel overseas with the child. The father shall return the child’s passport to the defendant within seven (7) days of his return to Singapore, upon which the father’s solicitors may release the deposit of S$20 000 to him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_10\"></a>10.     The parties agree that they shall respond within four (4) hours for urgent communication from the other party and within twenty-four (24) hours for non-urgent communications from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The present appeal</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In summons 1749/2024, the wife sought the sole custody, care and control of the child, offering the husband access every Saturday afternoon to Sunday evening. She asked that reasonable access be given to the child’s father on school holidays, on dates to be mutually agreed and subject to the child’s school and co-curricular activities. She also agreed that the father should have the liberty to take the child on holidays overseas. In summons 2035/2024, which was the husband’s application for variation of the consent order, he too sought sole custody, care and control of the child and offered access to the mother on weekends and an additional day in the school week. The wife claimed that the husband filed his application only in “retaliation” to the wife’s application. The husband on the other hand, alleged that the wife was unhappy that maintenance for the child was not increased when they were before a different court on account of the shared care and control arrangement. Nothing turned in my view, on the allegations by each party on the motivations of the other. The husband also sought a rescission of the order requiring S$20 000 to be placed as a deposit each time he travels with the child and that he be permitted to retain the German and Swiss passports for the child when these are issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On receipt of my orders, the wife’s counsel sought further arguments on 4 August 2024 in relation to the ability of the husband to retain the Swiss and German passports of the child once these were issued. Counsel sought to present these further arguments largely on the basis that the court ought not to have interfered with some parts of a consent order while retaining others. I declined to hear further arguments and the wife’s counsel appealed against all the orders, including the order rescinding the need for S$20 000 to be deposited with the husband’s solicitors when he travelled with the child. Given that the appeal was filed out of time, counsel sought an extension of time which was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Variation of the Consent Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Section 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) allows a court to vary an order for the custody, care and control of children where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in circumstances. S 129 of the Charter allows for the variation of terms that were agreed to between parties regardless of when the agreement was made and despite any provision to the contrary in that agreement where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so. In this regard, the words of the court in <b><em>VWQ</em></b> v <b><em>VWR</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> are instructive when it said that “<em>Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties, and the courts would be slow to re-write their contract. Privately settled terms negotiated by the parties, especially in family matters are to be encouraged. As such, they should be respected and not lightly changed. Otherwise, one party may lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to call in aid, the provisions in the Women’s Charter to vary their agreement when they feel that the bargain was not to their liking subsequently</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Both parties rooted their arguments largely on there being a material change in circumstances since the consent order was issued in April 2023 and/or its unworkability. If anything, the changes in circumstance were of a nature which called for the retention of the consent order save for the need to relook the issue of conditions imposed in relation to overseas travel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The wife wanted the joint custody order to be varied to one that allows her to have sole custody. The main reason appears to be that the parties have different parenting styles and there was an inability to communicate effectively on matters which involve the child. The court in <b><em>VRJ</em></b> v <b><em>VKR<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></em></b> quoting the words of the court in <b><em>CX</em></b> v <b><em>CY<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></em></b> two decades ago, and emphasising its continued relevance today said “<em>The court grants sole custody only in exceptional circumstances, such as where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child or where the parties’ relationship is such that co-operation is impossible even after mediation and counselling avenues are explored and this lack of co-operation is harmful to the child</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Often marriages come to an end because of unmet expectations, an inability to communicate effectively or different parenting styles which may lead to constant conflict. These cannot be reasons for sole custody orders unless the nature of these challenges bear on the welfare of the child. If it were otherwise, most parents and in particular fathers of young children, may see their rights and responsibilities limited. This will invariably affect a child who has benefitted from the presence and involvement of both parents when times were better. When parties separate, the need for co-parenting becomes an imperative as the child who suddenly finds himself without one parent in the home should not have to accept the absence of that parent in decisions which affect him. Save for situations where one parent is intentionally disrupting decision-making, there is no reason to remove a parent from his or her varied roles as protector, provider, decision-maker and supporter. When there is a divorce between a husband and wife, it must never result in a divorce between parent and child which a sole custody order effectively signifies. Sole custody orders should only be issued in cases where the facts clearly support the preservation and enhancement of the child’s welfare from such an order. Counsel for the wife relied on the cases of <b><em>Soon Peck Wah</em></b> v <b><em>Woon Che Chye</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> which defines child welfare and <b><em>AZB</em></b> v <b><em>AZC</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> where the court stated that a principled and pragmatic approach should be taken in determining material changes in circumstances. I was mindful of the court’s guidance in the cases cited as I approached the facts of the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     One of the key examples the wife chose to highlight in order to show that parenting styles were vastly different was in the training of the child to use the toilet. The child today is 7 years of age, and this example even if viewed as something of significance, is no longer relevant. Another concern raised was that the husband would sign his daughter up for classes without informing the wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> While clearly there needs to be communication between the parties on what the child’s activities are or should be, the fact that the husband was willing to take the child for these activities when she was with him and pay for these classes reflects his interest in exposing the child to activities beyond academic pursuits. Different parenting styles stem from differences in the backgrounds of the parents and what they were exposed to, growing up. The question is not whether the styles are different but whether exposure to different styles is harmful to the child. The child clearly will not be hurt by swimming classes and exposure to different languages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There is of course the danger that too many classes may result in the child having little time to rest or prioritise school demands. However, there was no indication of that and these matters must be left to the parents to work through. Both parents would want the child to thrive and they both show a resolve to maximise her potential.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The wife narrated an incident which she submitted was an example of a lack of communication between parties. This related to a time when the husband returned from an overseas trip with his daughter in March 2024. The husband was alleged to have ignored calls from the wife and it was only 3 hours later that the wife found the child at her father’s house. The wife speaks of how the child was “teary eyed” when the wife saw her and that she “….<em>had to assure [the child] that she could stay with the plaintiff if she wanted to</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> While the husband must certainly communicate with the wife who was anxious about the safe return of her child, I could not conclude that he had failed to do so intentionally. What perhaps is more telling is the response of the child. She wanted to stay on with her father and the mother ended up having to reassure her that she could. While it is always more convenient to parent alone after a divorce, it is almost always not the right way forward for the child. In the present case, the involvement of the father in all areas of the child’s life can only enhance her well being. He is able to guide her in her academic life, has the tools to help her regulate her emotions well<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and exposes her to the richness of cultures through the diversity of the larger family, on both sides. A court should not interrupt this. The wife in applying for variation of the consent order sought that reasonable access be given to the husband on dates to be mutually agreed. The fact that she felt that they could agree on the dates suggests I would have to assume, that she has no issue communicating with the husband. Even if she spoke of the resistance of the father to her choice of primary school for the child, the fact is that the child has been enrolled in the primary school that the mother wished for. Continued co-parenting can work in this case and would certainly send the right signal to the child of the love and care of both her parents. As a child without siblings and the absence of support from the larger family on her father’s side in Singapore, it would do little for the welfare of this child to reduce the support of her father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The wife also pointed to the fact that the husband travels extensively as a further reason for a change in the current arrangement. However by the time of the hearing, the husband no longer was in a work capacity that required regular travel and informed that he was not intending to take on work which would require it. The wife pointed to a specific incident in the past where the husband had to engage the help of a cousin’s daughter who flew in from Germany to care for the child when he had to travel. The reason for having done it was because the wife refused to care for the child during his period of absence from Singapore. The wife said “<em>However, sometime in November to December 2023, the plaintiff was, again, required to travel overseas for work. By that time, I had already been frustrated with the frequency of work trips that the plaintiff had been taking and for which I have to cover for him. I was reluctant to cover for the plaintiff yet again as I did not want the plainiff to form the habit in assuming that I was always available to cover for him</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In the context of a marriage, where one spouse has to travel for work, the other continues to care for the children. It should not have to be different in the context of divorce. The husband was not intentionally taking on travel. He was not using it as an excuse to avoid being present. He chose a relative from Germany simply because the order prohibits a non-family member from being tasked. The reluctance of the wife to step in was also troubling and further entrenches the idea that she was happy to have the child with her father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and Control of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the time the consent order was made and shared care and control of the child was agreed on, the child was in preschool. The wife seeks for care and control with access to the husband from Saturday afternoon to Sunday evening every week. She speaks of the unworkability of the order for shared care and control. She also spoke of how the child was stressed having to shuttle between homes and the lack of co-operation on the part of the husband resulting in the child trying to meet the expectations of both parties as a result of different parenting styles.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Acrimony is indeed a relevant factor in any analysis of whether shared care and control would be in the child’s interest.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The wife emphasised that the child suffered from night terrors and insomnia. She also attributed the onset of facial tics which the child appeared to have experienced, to the fact that the husband told the child to keep secret, the plans and activities the child had with him. The wife also pointed to the transition between the two homes and school as distressing for the child and that she was not “carefree” because she would be wondering who would be picking her up from a school on any given day. The wife further spoke of the child having dyspnoea (shortness of breath) which she said the husband downplayed. The wife essentially was seeking care and control on the basis that this would provide the child with security, stability and certainty.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The child having started primary school is an important factor when considering the need to have her under the care and control of one parent. It clearly is more convenient. In my view however, the present shared care arrangements served the child better and should not be disrupted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I met with the child together with a court psychologist on 25 June 2025. It was an opportunity and privilege to understand her feelings and to learn directly from her, how she sees herself, her parents and her life in school. She loves her parents and like most children, wants to ensure that they are not disappointed in her. She wants to be with both in the same home and is understandably sad that this is not possible. She did not find it difficult to travel from one home to school on a few days of the week and from another home to school on the remaining days. The difference in travel time between the mother’s residence to and from school and that of her father’s home to and from school, is negligible. As the husband put it, ‘10 versus 15 minutes” does not make much of a difference.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The father has put in place a pattern where the child is fed well and cared for. So too has her mother. The child is in lower primary school and school demands are not such that she would be burdened from having to be in two different homes over the week. In <b><em>XCQ</em></b> v <b><em>XCP</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> the need for “constancy and consistency” was the basis on which the court varied a shared care and control arrangement. It is my view that these are the very reasons to keep the shared care and control in place in the present case. The child is familiar with the routine, feels comfortable with it, enjoys her time with both parents and she does not have to travel long distances after school to the different homes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In Singapore, where distances between places are not large and where children often spend time in the homes of grandparents, uncles, aunts or in student care centres as they wait to be picked up by parents daily or even weekly, the wife should feel confident that separate homes in and of itself do not go against the interests of a child. The nature of the arrangements is what one needs to be concerned about. Clearly in some cases, shared care and control does not work for the child. The parents here however are available and accessible to the child, take the effort to pick her up and drop her off at school, communicate with her teachers, tutor if needed, and are attentive to her physical and emotional needs as seen in the engagement of the child psychologist by the father to address the child’s night terrors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The child is familiar and happy with the arrangements and it affords the father time to nurture the relationship. It should not be a court that displaces the potential for a strong and supportive father-child relationship even as the child continues to grow well under the guidance and love of her mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband has a lot more time today that he has stopped full-time work and can afford the attention that the child needs. There is no longer a need to travel overseas for work. The concerns that the mother has with respect to the child’s night terrors, insomnia and facial tics which she attributes to the need to move from one house to another is not borne out by the evidence. These incidents were when parties started to live apart and when the child was in preschool and she may have been stressed and anxious. The events however, occurred largely in 2023 and 2024. When I met her in the middle of 2025, she spoke of how she was doing much better. We had a very good conversation. If the parents co-operate, she is likely to do even better. The child needs time, space and peace to grow well. Only the parents can help her do that. The first step would be to communicate reasonably well with each other and compromise on issues that are close to the hearts of each parent. Importantly, allow the child to witness those efforts. When a parent is happy, a child often is too.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Termination of the need for a deposit and the retention of the passports by one parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The need for the father to deposit a sum of S$20 000 each time he travels with his child was not in my view a condition that should be kept in force. The husband was no longer represented by his legal counsel and it is unnecessary to retain it. If it was intended to secure the return of the child, it is of little value. The husband has been permitted to take the child overseas. In fact, the mother had repeatedly shown that she had no real concerns about the child being with her father. S$ 20 000 would not serve to deter a man who intends to keep his child away from Singapore and her mother. It cannot in my view be fair to impose conditions such as this everytime a Singaporean marries a foreigner. There is nothing in the past conduct of the husband to suggest that he would not return to Singapore. He has travelled with his daughter many times and his return to Singapore was not on account of the deposit that he wanted to have back. Agreeing to such a term may have been to provide some assurance to the mother initially but it cannot be for the long term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Even though the consent order provides for the wife to hand the child’s passport to the husband when he wants to travel with her, the wife had not done so at the time of the hearing for an intended trip during the school holidays. The wife’s counsel said that this was because the wife wanted the return of the child’s birth certificate held by the husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> There is additionally the need for the wife to facilitate the issuance of the German and Swiss passports which was at the time of the hearing, still outstanding. There is no good reason for all the passports to be retained by the wife. I ordered that when the German and Swiss passports are issued, the husband is to keep them while the wife retains the Singapore passport. This is in keeping with the nature of the shared arrangements in place. The child is a child of parents from different cultures. The fear of a mother that her child would not return to Singapore if the father has access to passports can be appreciated, but there is no evidence to support this fear. If a court were to issue orders to mitigate the possibility of abduction, it must be because the evidence shows a real risk. In this case it does not. Both Germany and Switzerland are parties to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and swift action can be taken against the husband who risks losing all contact with his child should he attempt to take the child out of Singapore without permission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There was no need to vary the consent order as it relates to the child’s custody, care and control. She is thriving under the current arrangements and the father is more available to her now than when the consent order was made. The concerns with night terrors and insomnia appear symptomatic of a child caught in between parents she loves and would rather that they remained together. With time, a new and healthy norm has come about and she is doing much better today. As the child grows and school demands become greater, there may be a need to relook the terms. For now, it is important not to fix things which are not broken. The workability of the order is contingent on how the parties conduct themselves. Open communication and a resolve to put the child first will produce good results for the family as a whole. Insofar as overseas travel conditions are concerned, the futility of placing a deposit with a counsel the husband no longer has and allowing the wife to be the custodian of all the child’s passports despite a shared care arrangement, logically and fairly called for a rescission of those orders.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>He has German and Swiss citizenship</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 9</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31950-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 29</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>[2005] SCGA 37</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>At paragraph 38</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>[1997] 3 SLR® 430</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 42 of wife’s affidavit of 4 June 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraphs 44-46 of the husband’s affidavit of 1 July 2024 filed for summons 2035/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 44 of wife’s affidavit of 4 June 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 31 of the husband’s affidavit of 1 July 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 65 of the wife’s affidavit of 4 June 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraphs 29 and 30</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup><b><em>TAU</em></b> v <b><em>TAT</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Paragraph 32 of wife’s affidavit of 4 June 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Page 11A of Notes of Evidence dates 23 May 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33149-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 26</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Paragraph 33 of the husband’s affidavit of 1 July 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Page 15E of the Notes of Evidence of 23 May 2025</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence","Family Law – Personal Protection Order","Family Law – Domestic Exclusion Order","Family Law – Stay Away Order","Family Law – No Contact Order","Family Law – Mandatory Treatment Order"],"date":"2026-01-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SSP 1284/2025","title":"XYD v XYE","citation":"[2026] SGFC 8","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34299-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Applicant in-person and unrepresented","The Respondent in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2026-01-16T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XYD v XYE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XYD <em>v</em> XYE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34299-SSP.xml')\">[2026] SGFC 8</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

She also sought a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”), a No-Contact Order (“NCO”) as well as a Stay Away Order (“SAO”) and a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of the matter on 15 October 2025. Judgment was reserved. My decision was delivered on 19 December 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife’s complaint was based on sexual abuse, as well as emotional and/or psychological abuse. She cited a single incident in support of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       This incident had taken place on 28 May 2025. The Husband had returned, with their two daughters, from a martial arts lesson. After he had left the house, the Wife placed an order for wine. She was alone in her room watching a show on her phone. The wine arrived at 11.15pm. The Wife says she had not eaten properly or slept well in days. She drank to help herself sleep. She said she was emotionally overwhelmed and physically exhausted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As the Wife was enjoying her alone time, the Husband re-entered the house and came into her room. He began to scold her for drinking. The Wife explained, during the trial, that this was because the both of them had agreed not to drink in front of the children, and that was because the consumption of alcohol was also against their religious beliefs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife says that she was lying on her side, facing away from the Husband. He had then come up behind her and hugged her tightly, refusing to let go.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife says she asked him repeatedly to stop, but she did not scream as she did not want to scare or traumatise the children. Despite her pleas, the Husband inserted his fingers into her vagina. The Wife begged him to stop. She told him that she would call the police. The Husband then proceeded to rape her as she continued to beg him to stop and “repeatedly said no”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> His response to her pleas was: “[i]f you’re going to report, might as well I finish it”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife says that eventually, after she begged him again, he stopped and left the room. She was left “in shock, violated, and emotionally destroyed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the wake of this incident, the Wife texted her friend to let her know what had happened. She fell asleep as she was physically and mentally drained. She reported the assault the next morning, and the Investigation Officer advised her to not have direct contact with the Husband. She was also advised to relocate temporarily for her own safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife described the impact of the assault on her. She said she was deeply affected, and that she fell into depression. She locked herself in her room for days and was unable to function. She said she was “constantly on edge” and that small sudden movements would frighten her, and she was “terrified” of having anyone behind her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I would, at this juncture, note that the documentary evidence produced by both the Wife and Husband was thin. There was, however, a first information report adduced by the Wife showing that she had made a police report at around 9 am on the 29<sup>th</sup> of May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband did not deny that he had sex with the Wife on 28 May 2025. However, he asserted that it was consensual. This was his account of events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     He said that after he had sent the two children home after their martial arts class, he had texted the Wife to inform her that there was a funeral at the void deck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He did this to warn the Wife, who was superstitious, not to be shocked if she heard sudden loud noises or prayers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Wife replied to ask where he was headed for the night. Upon seeing this text, the Husband assumed that she was afraid. This made him decide to return to the house. He found the Wife drinking. He says that they struck up a conversation, and that they started kissing soon after. According to him, that was how they had begun to have sex.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband also testified that he was upset when he discovered that the Wife had been drinking in the house. That said, it was his evidence that he did not scold her for doing so. He had asked her “why you doing this” in what he said was an “advising” or “managerial” tone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He says the Wife did not respond – she just stared blankly into space and held her glass of wine.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> After this, they began talking about the past, and their current relationships. It was during this time when the Husband said “it sparked”, and by that he meant that they had started kissing and had sex.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s account was internally inconsistent in that it was puzzling how he had gone from being upset with the Wife over her consumption of alcohol in the house, to a discussion on their shared past, and their conversation led to what he says was the consensual sexual intercourse that followed. By his own account, the issue of consuming alcohol in the house was quite a serious matter. Apart from the fact that it was against their religious beliefs, the Husband explained that it was necessary to demonstrate, to both their children, that drinking was not right and that it was prohibited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In this connection, I cannot see how this conversation on such a serious matter had led to, as the Husband claims, a discussion on their past sex lives and the consensual intercourse that followed. The Husband had also testified that when he walked into the master bedroom, he saw the Wife holding a glass of wine and staring blankly at the wall. He also said that when he had asked her about drinking wine in the house, she had kept quiet.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given the Husband’s evidence as to the state the Wife was in when they had that conversation about the consumption of alcohol, I found his account of events quite difficult to believe – namely that they had gone from a serious conversation on the consumption of alcohol in the house to a state of mutual arousal where they ended up having sex. I found that the narrative the Husband had presented was an attempt to cover up what had actually transpired – that he had forced himself on the Wife in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To sum up, of the two accounts of the events of 28 May 2025 that were presented to me, I found the Wife’s account to be more believable. Her account was internally consistent, and there was documentary evidence to support her version of events – namely, that first incident report on 29 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given that I accepted the Wife’s account of events on 28 May 2025, I also found that the Husband’s actions amounted to family violence – that he had committed an act of sexual abuse by forcing the Wife to have sex with him. I also found that the Husband’s actions in forcing the Wife to have sex with him did amount to emotional and/or psychological abuse – it was clear to me that the Wife was tormented and distressed by his actions to the point where she was not only startled or scared by sudden movements behind her, but had also fallen into depression.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In addition to this, I also found it necessary to order a PPO for the Wife’s personal safety or protection. The law makes it clear that in considering the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court undertakes a risk assessment: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. I am of the view that there was indeed a high risk of the Husband committing family violence on the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For one, the act of family violence which I found the Husband had committed showed that he had no respect for the Wife’s boundaries. Further, this act had also taken place in the house, when the children were at home. Although there are pending divorce proceedings between the Husband and the Wife, it did appear that the both of them would continue to interact with each other and share a physical space because of their children. That they would likely share a common space, in my judgment, and taking into account the act of family violence the Husband had committed, only pointed to the elevated risk of future family violence being committed on the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife was thus granted a PPO. Having granted the Wife a PPO, I considered that, in light of the act of family violence that had been committed, it was also necessary for her protection or personal safety to grant her a DEO which was limited to the master bedroom of the flat. In addition, I ordered that both the Husband and the Wife attend counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As for the other orders that the Wife sought, namely the SAO, NCO, and MTO, I did not find that it was necessary for those orders to be made. For one, there was no evidence put before me which hinted that the Husband suffered from any underlying mental condition that was the cause of the family violence. As for the SAO, the Wife had asked for the Husband to be prevented from coming within a 400m radius of the flat. Having already granted a DEO limited to the master bedroom, I did not find it necessary to order the SAO which the Wife sought. Finally, and in relation to the NCO, having considered the nature of the act of family violence that had been committed and the orders that I had already made, I concluded that it was not necessary to make such an order.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Statement at paragraph 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Statement at paragraph 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, pp 24 – 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, p 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, p 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript, p 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript, p 30 at lns 27 – 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript, pp 10 – 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order","Family Law – No Contact Order","Family Law – Stay Away Order"],"date":"2026-01-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SSP 960/2024","title":"XXG v XXF","citation":"[2026] SGFC 1","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34298-SSP.xml","counsel":["Nur Amalina Binte Kamal (IKA Law LLC) for the Sister","The Brother in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2026-01-16T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XXG v XXF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XXG <em>v</em> XXF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34298-SSP.xml')\">[2026] SGFC 1</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SSP 960/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">13 January 2026</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Nur Amalina Binte Kamal (IKA Law LLC) for the Sister; The Brother in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XXG — XXF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">No Contact Order</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Stay Away Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">13 January 2026</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SSP 960 of 2025 (“SSP 960”) was the Sister’s application against her Brother. She applied for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”), a Stay Away Order (“SAO”) and a No Contact Order (“NCO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the trial before me, the Sister was represented by Ms Amalina Kamal (“Ms Amalina”). The Brother was self-represented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial and dismissed the Sister’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       To succeed in her application, the provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 make it clear that she must prove the following two things on a balance of probabilities:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The first is that the Brother had committed, or was likely to commit, family violence on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The second is that the orders which she had applied for are indeed necessary for her personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Sister alleges that the Brother had committed family violence on her in the following incidents, which I shall deal with in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The first incident occurred on the 18th of April 2025. The background to this incident took place a day earlier. The Sister had received a frantic phone call from her Mother. It transpired that their parents had fought – this resulted in their Father leaving the house in Johor Bahru. The Father did not return. This prompted the Mother to call the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Sister checked the Father’s location on her mobile phone. However, the Father had disabled the tracking function. The Sister enlisted the help of neighbours in Johor Bahru to locate the Father. It was a sleepless night for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The next morning, when she attempted to track her Father’s location using the mobile phone application, she discovered that her Father’s last location was at her Brother’s residence. She was enraged that her Father would seek shelter with her Brother knowing full well that the Brother, according to her, was engaging in practices that were contrary to their religious beliefs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       She demanded that the Father return to the Johor Bahru home immediately. She sent him a series of harshly worded text messages as can be seen from the excerpt reproduced below:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.76%\"><col width=\"50.24%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Time Stamp</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Message</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">What are you doing going back to your son’s house with his slut</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Go back now</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Don’t make me lose my shit</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Get out of that cursed [XX] house now</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">What is wrong with you</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">You are going against my mother now</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:21 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">You wanna take shelter with your slut son</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:22 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">So now you’re following his slutty behaviour too</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:22 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Living together with his slut</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:22 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Becoming a sinner along with them</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:22 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Go back now</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">8:22 am</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">You wait at home</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Later that day, in the afternoon, she received a series of video messages. The Brother had sent these video messages using the Father’s WhatsApp account. The Sister says that those video messages were threatening. The Sister produced those video clips as well as the accompanying transcription and translation. The Brother had recorded these video clips and sent them to the Sister. He can be seen scolding the Sister and hurling verbal insults at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Of the Brother’s entire tirade, the Sister highlighted the two lines in which the Brother had threatened to “slap her face” and that he would do so even if it meant that he would go to jail. The Sister says that this constituted clear evidence of a threat to harm her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     When viewed in isolation, there was indeed much force to the argument that the two lines which the Sister had highlighted were threats of harm which would, conceivably, fall under the definition of physical abuse, or emotional and/or psychological abuse as is set out in the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It must, however, be remembered that when people are caught up in the heat of an argument, they may often utter rather nasty or unpalatable things out of sheer frustration. This was, in my judgment, exactly what had happened in the present case. The Brother had obviously taken offence with what the Sister had said to their Father about him. The Sister had exhibited copies of the messages which she had sent to her Father. In those messages, she had said many unpleasant things about the Brother. Unsurprisingly, the Brother was extremely angry and frustrated with what his Sister had said, which not only insulted him, but also conflicted with his core values. He thus decided to vent his frustration by scolding her. While one might, quite justifiably, rightfully describe his conduct or behaviour as seen in the video recordings as boorish and rude, I do not find that he had committed physical abuse, nor had he, through his actions, inflicted emotional or psychological abuse on the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to consider the second incident the Sister had complained of. This took place on 1 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Sister was with the Mother at the home in Johor Bahru. They had just returned from grocery shopping. They saw the Father’s motorcycle parked outside the house, but he was not in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At about 6.45pm, the Brother appeared at the front gate. He banged violently on the door. He shouted expletives. The Mother went to confront him. The argument escalated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     During this time, the Sister recorded the incident. She shouted for help from their neighbours. She said that she was frightened of what the Brother might do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The police were called in, and they arrived on the scene. Statements were taken, and both the Mother and the Sister sought refuge in a neighbour’s house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given that this incident had taken place in Johor Bahru, there was the preliminary issue of whether the family violence provisions in the Women’s Charter would apply to acts done abroad: see <em>AXK v AXL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0431.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 431</a> at [14] – [16]. Ms Amalina argued, referencing s 3 of the Women’s Charter 1961, that the relevant provisions applied to people that were either in Singapore, or domiciled in Singapore. Given this, and by extension, once the provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 applied, acts done abroad could also be taken into account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I did not need to decide on this point. That was because I did not find that the Brother had committed an act of FV in this incident on 1 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Recordings of the incident were produced. These recordings and the accompanying transcript show that there was a heated argument that had taken place. The Brother was exchanging salvoes with the Mother and the Sister. The Sister’s behaviour during this entire incident is telling. She did not appear to be frightened of the Brother. She was, after all, more than capable of retorting with her own barbed comments which were squarely aimed at the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Further, while the transcript did show that the Brother had, once again, threatened the Sister, it cannot be cited as an instance of the Brother inflicting family violence on her. The Brother was clearly responding to the Sister’s taunts about him being afraid of the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to the third incident which took place two days after the incident on 1 May 2025. The Sister was performing her duties as a Polling Officer. She says that the Brother had turned up at the polling booth that she had been assigned to. She says that he approached her booth and mocked her, saying: “eh what, not working ah”. She says that she froze and drew closer to her fellow Polling Officer for support. The Sister did not acknowledge the Brother. After the Brother voted, he left on his motorbike, and revved his engine as he left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I did not find that the Brother’s actions in this incident on 3 May 2025 fell within the definitions of family violence. It was a brief encounter between the siblings, and in my judgment, the Brother had merely tried to strike up a conversation with the Sister, notwithstanding the unpleasant quarrel they had had a few days prior. Although the Sister claimed that she was terrified of the Brother in this incident on 3 May 2025, because of the trauma she had suffered in the incident on 1 May 2025 – I found this to be an exaggeration. As I have mentioned, the videos of the 1st May 2025 incident clearly showed that the Sister was able to return verbal salvoes of her own, and indeed, had even taunted the Brother. She was not some helpless victim cowering in fear before the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I would add that even when I considered all the incidents complained of in totality, I did not find that the Brother had committed family violence on the Sister. The evidence did not show a continued and sustained campaign of harassment against the Sister. Rather, these incidents marked the increasingly frayed relations between the Brother and the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I also did not find that the Brother was likely to commit family violence on the Sister. The evidence before me only went so far as to show that the Brother would only react when provoked by the Sister. There was nothing before me to suggest that the Brother had a vindictive streak about him. Therefore, while one may conclude that the Brother may indeed have strained relations with the Sister, and that he might hold a grudge, there was nothing to suggest that he would act on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In short, I did not find that the Sister had proven that the Brother had committed family violence on her, or that he was likely to commit family violence on her. The result is that the Sister’s application for a PPO must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In any event, I did not find it necessary to grant a PPO for the Sister’s personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing the necessity of granting a PPO, the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment as to the likelihood of family violence being committed in the future. I found that there was a low risk of the Brother committing family violence on the Sister. For one, the Sister appears to have cut off all ties with the Brother. She was not living with him, and she had completely blocked him over messaging apps and social media. This degree of separation between herself and the Brother thus minimises the opportunity for further interaction, and with it, further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Sister’s application for a PPO was dismissed. It followed, as a result, that her application for a Stay-Away Order (“SAO”) and a No-Contact-Order (“NCO”) must also fail.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Ex-husband applying to vary child maintenance","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Ex-wife applying to enforce maintenance order – Ex-husband could afford to pay maintenance but had chosen not to breach maintenance order"],"date":"2026-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OADV 361 of 2025, MSS 1591 of 2025","title":"XXO v XXP","citation":"[2026] SGFC 5","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34282-SSP.xml","counsel":["Muhammad Hasif bin Abdul Aziz (M/s A.W.

Based on the instalment schedule, the last payment for the backdated child maintenance is <em>December 2025</em>. In other words, if the Father had complied with the schedule, the backdated child maintenance would have been completely discharged by the time of this judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Regrettably, the Father did not comply. The issue which thus arises is this – What is the most effective way to enforce the payment of the Arrears?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Further instalment payments untenable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Father seeks another opportunity to settle his outstanding maintenance payments by instalments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I reject this request. It is very clear that the Father has a poor track record in complying with a maintenance order. He has repeatedly failed to keep up with his maintenance payments even during periods when he had substantial means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Before October 2023, while earning a very high income of $23,840/month, the Father had accumulated $46,000 of backdated child maintenance. This is reflected in the 2023 Order at clause 3(b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Even after the 2023 Order gave him a structured instalment plan, the Father continued to default on his maintenance payments for the first three months (October to December 2023). During the trial, he did not provide any explanation for this default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Between August 2024 to July 2025, the Father failed to make full payment despite having received –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       An <em>ex-gratia</em> payment of $150,649.05 in April 2024 (when he was retrenched).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Income of about $18,000/month from December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Rental income of $1,500/month from January 2025 to at least August 2025 for some months.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     During the same default period, between August 2024 to June 2025, the Father had instead chosen to pay $15,260.04 for an MBA course.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Again, he did not provide any satisfactory explanation as to why he did not prioritise his obligation to pay child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">AEO is inappropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Having found it untenable to allow the Father to discharge the Arrears by way of instalment payments, I turn to the Mother’s request for an AEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     After careful consideration, I decided against making the order. This is because an AEO is unlikely to be an effective enforcement tool in the present case. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The power to issue an AEO is provided under s 81 of the Charter. It is directed to a respondent’s employer and depends for its efficacy on two things. <em>First</em>, the employer’s ability to comply with the duties imposed by the order and the Charter: s 84, s 85(1)(b) and s 86(c). <em>Second</em>, the Court’s ability to take appropriate actions if the employer fails to comply. In this case, the Father’s employer is in the UK and is thus outside the legal and practical reach of our jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, and in any event, it is unclear whether the Father will continue to work for his current UK employer for the long term. This is because since September 2025, he has been based in Singapore and there is evidence to suggest that he may be seeking alternative employment. (There is a WhatsApp message from him showing that he had a job interview in November 2025.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father can pay</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In determining the appropriate enforcement tool, I note that the Father can in fact afford to pay the Arrears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, as of May 2025, he had funds amounting to $93,286.52 in his savings account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> (The Father did not disclose more recent information regarding the funds in the account.) During the trial, he did not take the position that the funds are no longer available. Neither did he show good reasons as to why the funds should not be used to discharge the Arrears. It bears noting that he had ample opportunities to raise such issues at the trial.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Father has a 3-bedroom private apartment in Singapore. He can rent out one of its rooms should he need additional funds. After all, he had done so in 2025 and secured rental income at $1,500/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, and for completeness, his private apartment was valued in 2023 at $1,700,000. It had an outstanding mortgage of $696,369.60 at the material time. In other words, the Father has an asset with a net value of about $1,000,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Imprisonment is appropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given that the Father has the means to pay the Arrears, I decide to give him one <em>final</em> opportunity to do so. If he fails to seize on this opportunity, then imprisonment under s 71(1)(b) of the Charter will follow. A threat of imprisonment can be a very powerful deterrent for a maintenance defaulter who is able – but is unwilling – to pay maintenance: <em>XFB v XFX</em> [2024] SGFC 100 at footnote 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In my view, <b>14 days</b> will be a proportionate response to his maintenance default and to incentivise him to pay the Arrears. In coming to this view, I have considered that (a) this is a case of a parent not taking his duty to pay maintenance seriously (as opposed to one where the default was to cause hardship to the child and the care-parent), (b) the duration of the default is relatively long (some of the payments have been outstanding for more than two years), (c) the Father did make some payments during the default period, (d) this is his first enforcement action, (e) the Arrears are of a relatively significant value, and (f) there is no evidence that the Child and Mother has suffered serious hardship because of the default in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Order on enforcement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Accordingly, in relation to MSS 1591 of 2025 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I grant the Father a final extension of time to pay the arrears for the payable and backdated child maintenance from October 2023 to 6 January 2026 (totalling $38,100) into the Mother's designated account. He is to do so in four weeks’ time, i.e., by 3 February 2026 (“<b>due date</b>”). (<em>Note</em>. This is consistent with the Mother’s request for the Arrears to be paid in one lump sum.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Father fails to pay the Arrears by the due date, then –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Pursuant to s 71(1)(b) of the Charter, I order that he shall serve 14 days’ imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The sentence shall commence on 6 February 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father shall surrender himself to Court 1A of the Family Justice Courts at 12 pm on 6 February 2026 to commence his sentence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Clause 3(b)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     For completeness, I note that clause 3(b) of the 2023 Order states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The [Father] will pay to the [Mother] backdated maintenance of $46,000. This will be repaid to the [Mother] as an additional $1,700.00 per month for the next twenty-six (26) months, with a final payment of $1,800.00 on the 27th month, from 31 October 2023, and thereafter on the last day of each month. Payment will be made into the [Mother's] designated account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     When my decision was announced, the Father’s counsel sought clarification as to whether the payment schedule in clause 3(b) would need to be varied. On reflection, the answer is No. As stated in [27] above, by the time of this judgement, the schedule as already lapsed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     For the above reasons –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s Variation Application in FC/OADV 361 of 2025 is allowed to the extent in [25] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother’s Enforcement Application in MSS 1591 of 2025 is allowed to the extent in [36] above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s Skeletal Submissions dated 20.10.25 at [8], [9] and [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Father’s affidavit dated 21.05.25 at [7] and [9].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 11.08.25 at pages 27 to 36; Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at pages 29 and 34.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 31 (from April 2026 for Primary 4); Mother’s affidavit dated 11.08.25 at page 37.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 11.08.25 at pages 38 to 39.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at pages 32 and 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 11.08.25 at pages 40 to 42.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Rounded up from $1,387.11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Father’s position as put to the Mother during her cross-examination.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Father’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 40.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Rounded down from $1,725.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Rounded up from $575.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Father’s affidavit dated 21.05.25 at [11]; Mother’s affidavit dated 15.09.25 at page 40.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Mother’s affidavit dated 21.05.25 at page 62.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Based on the income slip in the Father’s affidavit dated 21.05.25 at page 21, the UK tax is GBP 3,118.86 (i.e., $5,410).

Brief details of parties’ respective applications are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 2415/2024 (“SS 2415”) - the ex-husband’s (“H”) application for a personal protection order against the ex-wife (“W”). H commenced SS 2415 on 23 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 2453/2024 (“SS 2453”) – W’s application for the same relief against H. W commenced her application on 30 December 2024, one week after H commenced SS 2415.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(collectively, the “Applications”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Applications relate principally to an incident which took place on 30 November 2024 at W’s residence. That being said, W had, in her complaint form, also referred to an incident on 6 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I further note that W had, in her affidavit, raised other incidents. However, not only were these incidents absent in her complaint form, they already formed the subject matter of prior protection order proceedings which have concluded. I touch on the legal effect and relevance of these other incidents later below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       From above overview, it would be apparent that this is not the first time parties have come before this court to resolve their disputes. Indeed, apart from personal protection applications, parties’ divorce proceedings was concluded a little over a year ago. Parties also filed other applications in connection with the divorce. I make these preliminary observations because it sets out the unfortunate state of parties’ animosity and distrust with each other. What was more unfortunate is that whilst parties continue to lock horns with one another, the sole child of their marriage continues to be the unwitting collateral of their animosity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Turning back to the Applications, after hearing parties and considering their respective documents and submissions, I granted H’s application in SS 2415 and dismissed W’s application in SS 2453. In other words, I granted H his PPO against W, and dismissed W’s application for a PPO against H. I provided parties with a written brief setting out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Dissatisfied, W has appealed against both decisions. I now set out fuller grounds for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Parties were married in February 2018. H commenced divorce proceedings in May 2023. Interim judgment was granted in November 2023. Orders relating to the ancillary matters were made on 30 July 2024, with final judgment granted on 31 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       There is only one child to the marriage (the “Child”). The Child, a girl, was born in January 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Previous protection order proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As noted earlier, parties were involved in earlier protection order proceedings before the Applications. In this regard, W had commenced the following applications against H:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 1100/2023 (“SS 1100”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 226/2024 (“SS 226”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In SS 1100, W had relied on, among others, an incident which took place on 11 March 2023. However, W had withdrawn the matter on H’s undertaking not to commit family violence against W and the Child. At the time W withdrew her application in SS 1100, W was represented<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Notwithstanding the withdrawal of SS 1100 (and correspondingly her reliance on the incident on 11 March 2023), W sought to rely on this same incident for the purposes of the present Applications. Furthermore, this incident was not included in her complaint form for SS 2453. It was only in her AEIC where W made mention of this incident<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As regards SS 226, W had relied on an incident which took place on 3 February 2024. After a full adjudication of the matter, this court dismissed W’s application. Notwithstanding the dismissal of SS 226, W sought to rely on and/or refer to the incident of 3 February 2024 in the present Applications. Again, as with the incident of 11 March 2023 in SS 1100, the 3 February 2024 was not included in W’s complaint form for this SS 2453, and was only highlighted in her AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Applications</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As noted earlier, H commenced SS 2415 on 23 December 2024. W commenced SS 2453 on 30 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In support of their respective applications, parties rely on the following incidents:</p> <table

noted above, the incidents of 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 were <em>not</em> included in W’s complaint form for SS 2453, and were also the subject matter of earlier proceedings. Only the incident on 6 October 2024 and the common incident of 30 November 2024 were included in W’s complaint form.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for H, he only relied on the common incident which took place on 30 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For ease of reference, I set out parties’ positions on these incidents (where applicable) and my findings on the same collectively in the sections below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis and Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable legal principles – statutory framework</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Before addressing the incidents cited by parties, I briefly set out the legal principles applicable to these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I begin with the statutory framework applicable to the Applications. In this regard, the applicable provisions relating to family violence are primarily found in Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”). Part 7 WC underwent significant legislative amendments pursuant to the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and Other Matters) (Amendment) Act 2023 (the “Amendment Act”), which came into effect on 2 January 2025. Essentially, the Amendment Act replaced Part 7 WC with a completely new version of the same. The new Part 7 WC provided for, among other things, a newer (and expanded) version of the definition of family violence, as well as an expanded list of protective orders which this court is now empowered to make.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the purposes of the present Applications, the first issue to be determined is which ‘version’ of Part 7 applies – the version before or after the Amendment Act came into effect. In this regard:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As noted earlier, the Amendment Act came into effect on 2 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 2415 and SS 2453 were commenced on 23 December 2024 and 30 December 2024 respectively, <em>before</em> the Amendment Act came into effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A reading of the transitional provisions under the Women’s Charter (Family Violence) Rules 2024 (“WC FV Rules”) (see rule 11) and section 21(1) of the Family Justice (General) (Amendment) Rules 2024 indicate that absent any deeming provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, family violence applications commenced before 2 January 2025 are to be based on the substantive and procedural law in existence <em>before</em> the commencement of the Amendment Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As such, the applicable provisions of Part 7 WC are those which were in force before the Amendment Act. In fairness, neither party sought to suggest that the new Part 7 WC applied to the Applications. However, I found it useful to set out the legislative framework applicable to the present applications in light of the Amendment Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable legal principles – requirements for a protection order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Further to the foregoing, the court’s power to grant a protection order under the ‘old’ Part 7 is found in then section 65 WC, which provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Protection order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65.—(1)    The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     From the above provision, it is well established that the court essentially undertakes a two-tiered analysis - first to establish the commission of family violence (or the likelihood of the same), and second, once family violence has been established, whether the protection order sought for is necessary or the protection of the relevant family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As regards the first stage, the phrase “is likely to be committed” underscores the pre-emptive approach to be adopted by the court, in that it is not necessary for a specific finding that family violence has <em>in fact</em> been committed (see <em>UTH v UTI (on behalf of child)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22888-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 27</a> and <em>UMI v UMK and UMJ and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a>). In this connection, the first stage can be satisfied so long as the court arrives at an articulable conclusion that family violence is likely to have been or will be committed by the respondent in that case. Whilst the legislation is worded in a pre-emptive manner, it does not absolve an applicant of the burden of establishing the same to the sufficient degree of veracity. An applicant cannot say that he has the building blocks of his case if he/she does not even have straw to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As regards the second stage, the analysis is usually framed in the negative - in that it would generally be a respondent who bears the evidential or tactical burden of showing that a protection order is unnecessary despite a finding that family violence has been (or likely to have been) committed (see Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition) at [5.017]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As regards the burden and standard of proof, it is well established that an applicant bears the legal burden of proof of establishing the requirements under the then section 65 WC, and that the applicable standard of proof is that of a balance of probabilities. As to what constitutes family violence, the then section 64 WC provides the following definitions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In her papers, W relies on the definitions of family violence found in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), and (d), whereas H relies on sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). For the purposes of the present Applications, what was clear to my mind was that both parties were substantively relying on the limb of ‘hurt’ under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) to support their respective applications. To this end, I found the wife’s reliance on the ‘harassment’ limb under sub-paragraph (d) did not assist her. With regard to “hurt”, the old section 64 WC defines “hurt” as being bodily pain, disease or infirmity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Step 1 – Has family violence been committed?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Against the backdrop of the foregoing, I now turn to the specific incidents relied on by parties in their respective documents and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 - Incidents which were not included in the complaint form and the subject matter of previously concluded proceedings –</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I start with the incidents of 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 relied on by W in support of SS 2453. As noted earlier, <em>both</em> incidents were not included in W’s complaint form at the time she commenced her application in SS 2453.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   The effect of not including an incident in the complaint form </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is at this point where I found it apposite to first make some observations regarding the complaint form (which applies for proceedings under the ‘old’ and ‘new’ Part 7 WC) which an applicant is required to fill up when making his/her application:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Section 179A WC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> provides that any application under Part 7 WC is to be made in the same manner as an application for a summons to a District Court or Magistrate’s Court under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010. This is more commonly referred to as a Magistrate’s complaint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During the intake process, an applicant will be required to fill out a document generally known as a ‘complaint form’. The complaint form will require the applicant to set out, among other things, the particulars of the latest incident of family violence which has been committed, as well as the particulars of the ‘past incident(s) of family violence’ which the applicant is relying on and/or wishes to refer to in support of his/her application. An applicant is then required to provide the date and time, place, brief details, type of violence and, where applicable, the injuries sustained (see Thean ed, <em>Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition) (“<em>Law and Practice of Family Law”</em>) at [17.7.5])</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At the first court mention after the application is accepted and the summons is issued and served on the respondent, the incidents listed by the applicant in the complaint form will then be read out to the respondent. This is the first time in which a respondent is faced with the specific particulars (or charges) of family violence alleged to have been committed by him/her. These particulars form the premise in which parties are then referred to counselling to attempt to reach an amicable resolution. This counselling session is conducted by a counsellor in the Counselling and Protection Services department of the Family Justice Court).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In the event that the matter is not resolved, parties will subsequently be given the conventional pre-trial directions for the preparation and submissions of affidavits and witness statements. More notably, parties will be provided with a copy of applicant’s complaint form. This is in part to ensure that the respondent is aware of the allegations levelled against him/her, and what he/she needs to prepare to meet those allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_e\"></a>(e)     From the brief sequence of events mentioned above, it will become apparent that the complaint form is akin to one’s pleadings in civil cases, in that it set out the parameters of the applicant’s case (which the respondent then has to meet). Moreover, given that it is the applicant’s application, he/she has complete and unfettered control of deciding what to include (or exclude) in that complaint. To this end, an applicant’s power to choose the cards he/she wishes to play with comes the responsibility that if an applicant does not include a particular incident in the complaint form, he/she is taken not to rely on such incidents in support of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Whilst is it not uncommon for parties to subsequently attempt to include incidents which were originally not in the complaint form,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that as a <em>starting point</em>, past incidents which were not included in the complaint form <em>should not</em> be considered as part of the court’s assessment of the applicant’s application. Unless there are special extenuating circumstances preventing an applicant from including a past incident he/she wishes to rely on in the complaint form, an applicant’s initial decision not to include such incident in the complaint form indicates a considered decision not to rely on such an incident in support of his/her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In my judgment, such an approach ensures that an applicant appropriately applies his/her mind on the scope of the application, making sure that at the very least, he/she has played his/her ‘best’ cards on the table. Such an approach also ensures procedural consistency and propriety in affording the respondent a clear and proper opportunity to present his/her responsive case. This in turn prevents and any information asymmetry, which would affect the manner in which the court is able to effectively conduct the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_h\"></a>(h)     In short, an applicant is required, at the outset, to take ownership of his/her application, and to carefully set out with sufficient clarity and details the incidents relied on in support of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Whilst the principles of natural justice dictate procedural propriety in a party’s conduct, it is not lost on this court that family proceedings are dynamic in nature, and rarely conducted with the sort of particularity (or clarity) as commercial transactions. To this end, there may then be a temptation by parties to go the other extreme and adopt a ‘everything and the kitchen sink’ approach, citing incidents in the complaint form through a stream of consciousness without much thought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_j\"></a>(j)     The effect of this is that what appears to be comprehensiveness actually amounts to prolixity. To borrow from the observations made by the High Court in <em>CVB v CVC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29149-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 31</a> (at [5]), this is done with the “[hope] that the drainer left in the sink (ie, the unfortunate court) would sift out and salvage some useful items”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_k\"></a>(k)     While such instances cannot be wholly eradicated, in my judgment, this would be appropriately managed at various stages of the application, either at the intake stage before the duty judge, at the mentions stage, or ultimately at the trial stage. At each of these stages, the court is empowered with the procedural tools to prevent such abuse (this includes the power to out as well as making the appropriate adverse cost orders).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For the above reasons, I was inclined to give little weight to these two incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   The effect of a withdrawal and a dismissal order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     While the foregoing alone would dispose of W’s reliance of the 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 incidents completely, I found it apposite to also highlight why these two incidents should not have even been canvassed in the first place. Let me explain:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As regards the 11 March 2023:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       This incident formed, in effect, the core incident in support of W’s application in SS 1100. As acknowledged in her own submissions, W had withdrawn her application in SS 1100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The effects of a party withdrawing his or her application are not controversial. By withdrawing the application, an applicant will not be able to rely on the incidents referred to in that application should the applicant decide to file a fresh application (see <em>Law and Practice of Family Law</em> at [17.7.19]). The jurisprudential prohibition is that the decision to withdraw the application concludes the matters raised therein, and therefore render those matters <em>res judicata</em>. The specific legal basis for this prohibition is founded on the extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> (ie, abuse of process) (see <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0453.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</a> (at [51] to [53]), which was referred to by this court in <em>USC v USD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22740-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 6</a> (at [95])). Put another way, if a party chooses not to pursue a particular matter that forms the subject matter in formal proceedings, it does not lie in that party’s mouth to try to resurrect and/or relitigate that point in subsequent proceedings. The principle of finality in litigation is well established and in my view, applies with greater force in family proceedings so that parties can focus on moving forward (see <em>WXD v WXC and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32854-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 14</a> and <em>VTP v VTO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33727-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 52</a> (at [28]), which was referred to by this court in <em>WWK v WWL</em> SGFC 118 at [3] to [4]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, I note that <em>both parties</em> were represented at the time SS 1100 was withdrawn. There is nothing to suggest that W was unaware of the consequences of a withdrawal, especially so given that she had the benefit of counsel. She may not have liked the concession made (or feels that she felt that she was “manipulated”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> into withdrawing the matter), but I was not inclined to accept that her withdrawal was equivocal. Put another way, apart from the bare contention of manipulation, there was nothing to suggest that such withdrawal be vitiated or downplayed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As regards the incident of 3 February 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The 3 February 2024 was an incident which had been fully adjudicated upon by this court and dismissed in SS 226. No appeal was lodged against the dismissal of SS 226. This clearly renders the issue <em>res judicata</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       There can be little dispute that it would be both procedurally and/or substantively erroneous for W to rely on the 3 February 2024 incident in these proceedings. W is estopped (by cause of action estoppel and/or issue estoppel) from relying on the 3 February 2024 incident in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Reasoning by propensity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the event that I am wrong, and that some consideration be given to the 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 incidents, I found it necessary to set out the context in which these incidents were being relied upon by W:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We wish to highlight that only the incident on 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 highlighted above was the subject of previous PPO applications taken out by [W]. Notwithstanding that one of the PPO applications was withdrawn, it is crucial to note that this <b>is still important to establish [H]’s past conduct</b> of violence and further this PPO application was only withdrawn as [H] had manipulated [W] into doing so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     What can be discerned from the above extract is W’s contention that it was more probable than improbable that H had committed the more recent incidents of family violence <em>because of</em> these earlier incidents. Put another way, H committed (or was more likely to have committed) family violence on 6 October 2024 and/or 30 November 2024 because he had (on W’s narrative) committed family violence o on 11 March 2023 and/or 3 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     This submission essentially amounts to reasoning by propensity (ie, a person’s past misconduct increases his/her disposition or tendency to have committed the act presently charged with). In my view, this is an improper way to rely on such evidence (if at all). Indeed, the rejection of the use of such surrounding evidence was mentioned (albeit in the criminal context) by the High Court in the recent case of <em>PP v Soh Jing Zhe and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32680-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 331</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For those reasons, I was not inclined to rely on the 11 March 2023 and 3 February 2024 incidents in my assessment. In fairness, at the hearing, Mr Singh, W’s counsel, was not relying on these incidents for the purposes of establishing the first step of the assessment. Instead, Mr Singh alluded to this court’s decision in <em>XFL v XFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a>, for the purpose of seeking to establish a conduct of violence by H, and the necessity of a protection order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Whilst the observations made in <em>XFL</em> on the factors to be considered in determining whether a protection order is necessary are not particularly controversial, I am of the view that this decision does not take W much further. This is because the critical distinction is that the 11 March 2023 was specifically <em>withdrawn</em> by W, and the 3 February 2024 incident has already been <em>dismissed</em> by this court. W might personally feel that H had committed violence against her during these two incidents, but there is no legal basis in which this court ought to consider these incidents in light of their withdrawal or dismissal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">6 October 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I turn next to the incident on 6 October 2024. W’s narrative as regards this incident can be summarised as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the said date, H attended at W’s residence “unannounced and demanded to pick up [the Child]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As the Child was apparently reluctant to follow H, H had requested to speak with W in a separate room privately. In that room, H had taken a “very intimidating tone and unleased a series of threats”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. This included him threatening to seek sole custody of the Child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During this time, H suddenly grabbed [W]’s neck with his right hand and shoved [W] backwards.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> As H tightened his grip, he taunted the words “beat, beat” repeatedly in rage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> As a result of H’s actions, W’s head struck the bedframe in the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After committing the aforementioned acts of family violence, H left the room and left W’s residence. As H was leaving W’s residence, W asked whether H beating her made him “feel good”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_e\"></a>(e)     After leaving W’s residence, H then called W in a “cold and threatening”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> manner, essentially warning W not to report the assault. In doing so, he also issued a condescending statement to the effect that W would have to eat faeces if she were to report what happened.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In support of her case, W submitted the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Her police report which she made on the same day;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     an audio recording (and transcript) of H’s conversation with W where he had made the comment about W eating faeces;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     a discharge summary and medical certificate from Sengkang General Hospital;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     a conditional warning administered by the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> I pause here and note that H has previously been issued a earlier warning by the police in connection with the 11 March 2023 incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Not surprising, H denies committing any form of family violence against W in the room that day. That said, H’s evidence on this incident in his AEIC is relatively brief. It also bears mentioning that H did not spend much timing cross-examining W about this particular incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In his affidavit, H states the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For the 2<sup>nd</sup> police case in which I received a conditional warning, it was related to an incident on 6 Oct 2024 where my ex-wife alleged I had threatened her and strangled her. Like the incident mentioned above, I rejected such an allegation and submitted my statement to the police. The Deputy Public Prosecutor, looking at the statements submitted, decided not to bring this case to trial and instead issue a conditional warning. This warning was given without me ever accepting that I had indeed ever committed such an offense, and without the full facts and arguments being heard infront [sic] of the courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     At the hearing, H tried to explain that he did not include as much detail regarding the 6 October 2024 incident because he was focusing mainly on the 30 November 2024 incident. In addition, he apparently had issues having access to W’s complaint form.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> To this end, whilst categorically denying the allegations of family violence, H did acknowledge the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     H acknowledges that he had gone into the room (where W alleged to have been strangled and shoved) and had a discussion with W regarding the Child’s arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> For clarity, H’s position was that it was W who had brought him to the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     H acknowledges that after the conversation, he left the room and proceeded to leave the house. During this time, he also acknowledged that W had made the comment of saying whether “does beating make you [ie, H] feel good”. In other words, H acknowledges that W had said those words to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     H further acknowledged that shortly after leaving W’s residence, he did call her. During that call, he also acknowledged referring to W eating faeces. However, his explanation under cross-examination was that the context in which it was said was a colloquial way of highlighting that W would suffer negative consequences for her general behaviour (ie, persistently making false allegations about him).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In short, H’s evidence broadly conforms with W’s narrative, save for the alleged acts of verbal and physical abuse which took place in the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     After assessing the evidence and materials before me, and whilst H had focused his attention on the 30 November 2024 incident, I was of the view that W had not satisfactorily discharged her legal burden of establishing the commission of family violence. I explain my reasons for arriving at this conclusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As regards the physical violence, W’s affidavit evidence (as stated in her police report) was that H had, “in a sudden fit of rage”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, grabbed W’s neck, “violently choked” it as he tightened his grip with one hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Additionally, H had shoved her, causing her head to strike the bed frame with “jarring”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> force.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     These are strong and weighty words specifically chosen by W, which presumably reflects the intensity of the alleged force exerted on her. This is further supplemented by the intensity of his voice when he said “beat, beat” which was apparently captured by the CCTV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     However, the contemporaneous evidence is not reflective of the violence alleged to have been committed on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     To start, despite making specific reference to the CCTV recordings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, W did not furnish such evidence. Similarly, insofar as W contended that she mustered up the courage commenting whether beating “us” (presumably referring to W and the Child) felt good, W did not submit evidence from the CCTV. This is despite her own averment that this exchange was captured by the CCTV.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Next, and assuming W’s narrative of what took place in the room was true, I found W’s subsequent conduct to be curious. First, I can appreciate that W would refrain from escalating the issue of H’s violence whilst H was in the house given that there was a CCTV recording (which, on W’s evidence, had apparently captured H saying “beat beat”). However, there was nothing preventing W from asserting her position in the living room with the knowledge and security of the CCTV should there be further escalation by H. Second, I also found her conversation with W after H had left the house somewhat wanting. If W’s narrative was true, there would have been nothing preventing her, after H had alleged that she was manufacturing an issue and asked her to eat faeces, to retort back and state, in chapter and verse, what H had done to her earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Apart from a general assertion of H having hit her,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> nothing was said about what H had done to her in the room on 6 October 2024. There would have been nothing preventing W from making these points in her audio recording, especially given that H was no longer in her residence by that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Separately, I was not persuaded by the suggestion that H’s call would have deterred (assuming that that was H’s intent, which I was not fully inclined to accept) W from making the necessary reports against him if H had indeed physically assaulted W. On the evidence before me, W did in fact make the police report which led to the necessary investigations leading up to the conditional warning by the police. Put simply, I was not inclined to accept W’s narrative on the premise of the call as H attempting to silence W.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Next, as regards her supporting documents, I first assessed the police report to be a neutral piece of evidence, as it was essentially W’s narrative of events. As observed by this court in <em>XJZ v XJY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33006-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 30</a> (at [22(a)]), police reports (given that they are made by the parties themselves) can be self-serving. As noted earlier, the language used by W in the police report was highly descriptive, but was not corroborated by the evidence which the W herself asserts she had (ie, the CCTV recordings).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I turn next to the documents from Sengkang General Hospital.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>

style=\"max-width: 100%;height: auto;height:68.8671111111111pt;width:173.430965277778pt;\"></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I found this document to be similarly wanting, especially considering the extent in which W had narrated the purported physical violence committed by H. There is no specific mention or explanation of the injuries to the neck, considering H had “violently choked” her. Even if the injuries to W’s neck may fall within the general rubric of “musculoskeletal pain”, there was a notable disjunct between what the medical note provides and the extent of W’s narration of the events that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In note that the Applications were fixed for hearing sometime in March 2025. That would have been approximately 5 months after the 6 October 2024 incident. There would have been nothing preventing W from conceivably obtaining a more detailed medical report from Sengkang General Hospital which sets out, in greater detail, the findings and observations of the attending physician, and whether it is consistent with the points made in W’s police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     To be clear, I am not making a finding that W was not suffering from anything when she attended at the Sengkang General Hospital. However. In my view, there mere existence of a medical note, without more, does not dispose of the germane question which this court is tasked to ascertain - whether is it is more probable than improbable that the alleged injuries which W went to the hospital for was caused by the act(s) of family violence committed by H. This question must be assessed on the totality of the evidence presented before this court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I turn next to the conditional warning letters. At the outset, the legal consequence of a warning letter is clear - it is nothing more than an expression of an opinion, and has no legally binding effect (see <em>Wham Kwok Han Jolovan v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18544-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 1370</a>). That said, the crux of W’s reliance on this warning letter is that there must be some level of satisfaction (at least by the police) that H has done something, and that something would be able to satisfy the threshold of family violence under the WC. In short, while a conditional warning letter is not legally binding in itself, there is no smoke without fire.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     However, in my judgment, the warning letter is neutral insofar as it neither aids nor harms the surrounding corpus of evidence submitted by W. Whilst I note that the warning letter makes reference to the offence of voluntary causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code 1871, what was the precise act which H was being warned for? In my judgment, this letter must be viewed in the context of the strength of W’s narrative and the contemporaneous materials submitted by her. As noted above, I found W’s evidence to be wanting in various regards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Lastly, when compared with the physical violence which W says H had committed on her on 30 November 2024, what happened to W on 6 October 2024 appeared, to my mind, to be the more serious incident on its face. However, W chose not to commence any personal protection proceedings against H. It was only after H commenced SS 2415 (more than 2 months after the 6 October 2024 incident and because of the 30 November 2024 incident) that W then sought to file her own application under SS 2453. No meaningful explanation was given for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It is also worth noting that the conditional warning in respect of the 6 October 2024 incident was issued on 26 November 2024. Putting aside the 30 November 2024 incident, it cannot be discounted that that warning letter would have been the end of the matter (at least to W’s mind). This contributed to my assessment on the veracity of W’s claims of the existence (and/or extent) of acts of family violence on 6 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For those reasons, I had difficulties accepting W’s narrative contention that family violence has been or had likely been committed by H on 6 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">30 November 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn to the last and common incident between parties – the 30 November 2024 incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     While parties’ evidence differs at various parts, parties’ respective narratives appear to converge on the following core sequence of events:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     H attended to W’s residence in the evening for a discussion regarding the Child’s enrichment class, specifically between Hindi and Mandarin. H had also been at the house earlier that day. The discussion took place in the living room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Taking parties’ evidence collectively, both parties minimally knew that H was recording their conversation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On H’s evidence, the discussion, to his mind, was getting “heated”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>, and sought to disengage to leave. As he stood up to leave, W had “suddenly grabbed [his] hair on [his] head and violently started to pull it”. Because of this, H then exclaimed “Ow Ow”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On W’s evidence, she says that H had orchestrated the exclamation, <em>and then</em> proceed to pull W’s hair. It is at that point when W then “screamed for her helper” as H was pulling her hair.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> I pause here and note that some time was spent clarifying W’s evidence as to when and how H had allegedly pulled W’s hair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       First, in her affidavit, W contended that H pulled her hair <em>as he was making</em> the exclamation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Second, during cross examination, W then said that H had first made then exclamation, and <em>thereafter</em> proceeded to pull W’s hair.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Third, in her written closing submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>, W stated that H grabbed and pulled W’s hair “with force”, and shouted “Ow Ow Ow”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The upshot of this is that W’s final position appeared to be a hybrid of her position on affidavit and cross-examination. What can nevertheless be discerned is that H’s act of pulling W’s hair was contemporaneous with and sequentially after his exclamation. In short, and taking W’s evidence, H’s exclamation and him pulling W’s hair was <em>one continuous transaction</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_e\"></a>(e)     It is at this point where I refer to the evidence of W’s helper, TS. In her affidavit, she says the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Suddenly, I heard [W] shout my name twice in distress. When I turned towards the living room, I saw [H] pulling on [W]’s hair. I immediately ran to the living room to intervene. However, upon my arrival, [H] released the [sic] [W’s] hair and moved away from her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_f\"></a>(f)     It bears mentioning that TS’ affidavit evidence <em>did not</em> deal with H’s exclamation. However, during cross examination, TS later testified that she was in the kitchen during the time W and H were having their discussion. She also testified that she had heard H exclaim “Ow Ow Ow”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_g\"></a>(g)     However, she <em>did not</em> see what happened contemporaneous with hearing H’s exclamation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The upshot of this is that on W’s narrative I had highlighted above, it would mean that TS <em>would not</em> have seen either H and/or W pulling each other’s hair. When viewed in this light, I had my reservations on the veracity of TS’ testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_h\"></a>(h)     As noted in her evidence, it was only when TS approached parties <em>after</em> W called for her where she says that H was still in the midst of pulling W’s hair, and released his grip subsequently. However, it bears noting that it <em>was not</em> in W’s own evidence that H was still pulling her hair by the time TS arrived, only to then release his hold on W’s hair. Moreover, I also note that the audio recordings do not appear to reflect TS’ narrative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_i\"></a>(i)     If anything, the hair pulling (by H and/or W) was already done by the time TS arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     After assessing the evidence and materials before me, the central question is whose version is more probable than improbable. In my assessment, I found H’s narrative to be more probable and less problematic than W’s narrative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I first start with the contemporaneous evidence submitted by parties in support of their respective narratives. At all material times up to the hearing of the Applications, the only contemporaneous evidence was the audio recordings which H had taken that day. At no point in time did W state that she similarly had an audio recording of what transpired. Indeed, W made no mention of an audio recording in her AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     However, on the first day of the hearing, it transpired that W had made a recording, and only prepared the same on the day of the trial. To that end, Mr Singh sought leave to include it as part of the record of the proceedings. I pause here and found it apposite to record my regret for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. The irresistible inference which can be drawn from the foregoing is that W had kept these recording close to her chest, and it was only after having sight of H’s AEIC (and H’s recording) that she wished to introduce her own recordings. To my mind, this was the only reasonable inference to be made because in her AEIC, W specifically explained why she was unable to obtain the CCTV recording of what happened at the living room on 30 November 2024. How is W able to explain away her inability to obtain the CCTV recording of the living, and keep completely silent of the fact that she had in her possession her own audio recording?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Giving W the greatest benefit of doubt, she may have omitted to include it at the time AEICs were due to be exchanged. but between the time parties’ AEICs were being prepared. However, by the time AEICs were exchanged, there was nothing preventing W from giving reasonable notice to this court and H of the existence of such evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I found this form of gamesmanship by W to be very unfortunate. For clarity, I direct my reservations towards W, and not to Mr Singh. I was prepared to accept that had Mr Singh, who was representing W throughout the pre-trial mentions leading up to the hearing, have knowledge of the existence of such audio hearings, it would have been highlighted to the court (and H) and the earliest juncture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Be that as it may, I was nevertheless prepared to include this belatedly introduced recording, in part due to H’s preparedness to accept W’s recordings to be included as part of the court’s records. Even then, I noted that W’s recordings had missing content, content which was found in H’s version.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     To be clear, <em>both parties’</em> translation and transcribed versions had their inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Akin to the situation highlighted in <em>CVB v CVC</em>, it was then left to this court to try to make sense of the recording with reference to <em>both</em> sets of transcripts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     With that in mind, I first start with H’s case. After assessing the materials before me, I had reservations with W’s negative case that H orchestrated the entire incident. On both parties’ evidence (and putting aside W’s belated discovery that the CCTV was not recording), the fact remains that there were multiple recording devices activated at that time. H had a recording, and to H’s personal belief, the CCTV in the living room was also recording. Separately (albeit unknown to H), W was also taking a recording. At this point, I note during cross-examination that W sought to suggest that H had possibly tampered with the CCTV<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. However, this averment was not stated in her AEIC. In any event, I found this suggestion to be highly improbable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Against that backdrop, I was of the view that for H to orchestrate this entire incident, which can easily be rebutted, it would at best be a very dicey gamble, and at worse, manifestly foolhardy. Further, if indeed H was faking this event, it would have been instinctive of W (who was, at the time, also recording) to defend her position with a quick retort with statements such as “what are you doing?”, or “what are you shouting about?”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     No such retort was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In this regard, and referring to W’s own authority of <em>Parkes v The Queen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/12970-E-M.xml')\">[1976] 1 WLR 1251</a>, what is sauce the goose is sauce for the gander, and W’s lack of immediate objection is notable. On the other hand, and whilst not captured in W’s transcript, after his exclamation, it can be heard (albeit faintly) that H was asking what W had done (or said).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     In my judgment, what was more probable was that when faced with the situation, W then doubled down to attempt to paint a narrative that H was the aggressor. It is for that reason why she immediately called upon TS to come. If W’s narrative was true, and at this time it was H who was pulling on W’s hair, I found it curious that W had no reaction to H’s pulling. Even if she wanted to call TS, and there was in fact a pulling of hair to the extent suggested by W, there would surely have been some audible reaction or exclamation to this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     However, there was not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     Instead, as per the audio recording, W proceeded to articulate what happened to TS.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Upon a review of the entire transaction through the audio recording, I was inclined to prefer H’s narrative as the more probable narrative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     As regards the documentary evidence submitted by W, I note that Sengkang General Hospital’s note only includes a solitary reference to “assault”, which is even more bereft of details than the memo prepared for the 6 October 2024 incident. On the other hand, the medical note submitted by H stated that H had “mild erythema<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>” at the scalp region.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     For completeness, as regards the lack of CCTV evidence, I found this to be a neutral point, but somewhat curious. While there was no reason to disbelieve W’s explanation as to why the CCTV was not working (notwithstanding H’s evidence where he says that the indicator light on the CCTV indicates was on), I separately found it curious that since W was already making an audio recording of the conversation, that she would, particularly in the light of parties’ history, to at least cursorily ascertain whether the CCTV was on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     For the above reasons, I was more inclined to find that H’s narrative of events to be more probable than improbable. As such, I was satisfied that family had been or likely to have been committed by W during the 30 November 2024 incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Step 2 - Necessity for protection orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     With that finding, I come to the next issue of necessity. In her submission, W had made various contentions on why even if the first stage was established, why it was not necessary for a protection order to be made against W.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> While I note that H still continues to engage W (partly due to access arrangements under the divorce ancillary orders), I was not inclined to accept that the nature and state of parties’ relationship with each other is such that a protection order is not necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     It cannot be a case where, assuming I find family violence by both parties, a protection order is necessary for one party but not the other. To my mind, parties’ submission on necessity <em>cuts both ways</em>. So long as family violence is established, there is necessarily a need for a protection order to minimally alert parties of how they should conduct themselves with each other. Separately, and though a lesser point, during cross cross-examination, W candidly submitted that if it can be proved that she did pull H’s hair, then he should get a personal protection order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In my judgment, after establishing the commission of family violence, I found it necessary for a protection order to be made. The nature of parties’ interactions necessitate an order to regulate their conduct. Separately, I was of the view that a protection order was necessary in part because of the utility of parties going for counselling. I found it necessary for parties to receive the necessary support services to address the underlying issues between them, which run deeper than the matters raised in these proceedings. These orders merely form a patchwork of the real work which parties need to do in order to properly move on. In my view, parties required proper intervention to allow them to be able to move on and effectively co-parent. Otherwise, they will continue not find themselves entrenched within the four walls of this court to litigate their personal animosity against each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     For the above reasons, I was inclined to grant H a PPO, and dismiss W’s application for a PPO. I further ordered both parties to attending counselling to help address their underlying issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     On the issue of costs, after issuing my decision to parties, I directed parties to submit their respective cost submissions. After considering parties’ submissions, I was inclined to order that both parties were to bear their own costs for the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Finally, I wish to thank Mr Singh and H for their submissions and assistance to the court in arriving at its decision. It is my sincerest hope that parties will be able to move forward, if not for themselves then for the sake of the Child.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Former spouses fall within the definition of a “family member” under the Women’s Charter 1961.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Parties’ documents comprise of the following:(1)Parties’ respective complaint forms.(2)H’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) dated 10 February 2025 (“H AEIC”).(3)W’s AEIC dated 3 March 2025 (“W AEIC”).(4)The AEIC of B (“TS”) dated 4 February 2025 (“TS AEIC”).

The Mother had previously obtained a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Son. That order was granted by consent on 13 December 2021. In SSP 977, the Mother sought further orders in addition to the PPO She sought, in her application, a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) for the entire house, a No Contact Order (“NCO”) and a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The statutory framework provides that such further orders will only be made if the court is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that they are necessary for the protection or personal safety of the Mother: see s 60B and 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In the present case, I was satisfied that it was necessary for the Mother’s protection or personal safety that such further orders be made. For one, the Son admitted that he had a volatile temper, and that he would lose control if his boundaries were crossed. Further, it was also evident that since the PPO was granted, there were further incidents between the Mother and the Son. In those incidents, the Son had hurled vulgarities at the Mother, and threatened her. I was thus satisfied that these further orders which the Mother had applied for were indeed necessary for her protection or personal safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       That being said, I was minded to calibrate these orders. For one, while the Son had admitted that he would lose control when he was angry, he did demonstrate that he had, at the very least, an insight into his anger management problems. He spoke to how he could imagine the impact he had on those around him, should he lose his temper, and how he would take steps (albeit unhealthy ones) of controlling his temper, such as getting drunk, hanging out with friends, locking himself in the room and punching the wall. There is also the fact that the Son had voluntarily gone to the Institute of Mental Health to seek treatment for his anger issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I will therefore grant the DEO, but it shall be limited to the Mother’s bedroom. This is so that the Mother has a safe space within the house, in the event the Son should lose control of his temper. On the facts before me, I did not find the situation to be so severe as to warrant the Son from being excluded entirely from the house. Further, the NCO I am granting will only prohibit the Son from communicating with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Finally, I was also minded to order a MTO. But before I can do so, the report of a psychiatrist is needed. I therefore ordered that a formal assessment report be produced to determine if the MTO may be ordered.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2025-12-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 2240/2023","title":"XWN v XWO","citation":"[2025] SGFC 142","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34248-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Clement Yap Ying Jie, Ms Jasmine Chang Jia Min and Ms Laura Eng Sing Joo (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the applicant/wife","Ms Peggy Sarah Yee May Kuen, Ms Audrey Liaw Shu Juan and Mr Jerome Tan (PY Legal LLC) for the respondent/husband."],"timestamp":"2026-01-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Phang Hsiao Chung","html":"<root><head><title>XWN v XWO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XWN <em>v</em> XWO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34248-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 142</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 2240/2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">29 December 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Phang Hsiao Chung </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Mr Clement Yap Ying Jie, Ms Jasmine Chang Jia Min and Ms Laura Eng Sing Joo (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the applicant/wife; Ms Peggy Sarah Yee May Kuen, Ms Audrey Liaw Shu Juan and Mr Jerome Tan (PY Legal LLC) for the respondent/husband. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XWN — XWO </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">29 December 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Phang Hsiao Chung:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       MSS 2240/2023 was an application under section 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) by a wife and mother of 4 children (the “Mother”) against her husband and the father of the children (the “Father”) for maintenance for herself and each of the 4 children (each a “Child” and collectively, the “Children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This case raises the question of the extent to which a sole breadwinner of a family, which is accustomed to a high standard of living, is obliged to maintain the family at that standard of living, after unilaterally deciding to change his lifestyle in a manner that reduces his income substantially.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties and their Children are Canadian nationals who moved to Singapore in December 2013.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father was a senior executive in the Singapore office of a multinational corporation (the “Singapore Employer”), and was employed on generous terms that included expatriate allowances. The Mother was a homemaker who had entered Singapore on a Dependant’s Pass linked to the Father’s Employment Pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Children are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     a son born in 2006 (the “1st Child”), who studied at an international school (“International School A”) until he went abroad in September 2025 for university studies;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     a son born in 2008 (the “2nd Child”), who studies at International School A;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     a son born in 2011 (the “3rd Child”), who studies at a different international school (“International School B”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     a daughter born in 2013 (the “4th Child”), who also studies at International School B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In August 2023, the Father unilaterally moved out of the family home to live with another woman (“W”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Around that time, the Father offered to maintain the family’s lifestyle, and to pay the Mother $20,000 per month for the maintenance of the family, in addition to paying for the Children’s school fees, school bus fees, and the monthly rent of the family home. The Father subsequently reduced his offer to paying $11,000 per month, in addition to the Children’s school fees, school bus fees, and the monthly rent of the family home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After the Father reduced financial support for the family in September 2023, the Mother commenced MSS 2240/2023 on 2 October 2023 to obtain maintenance for herself and the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father resigned from the Singapore Employer on 9 October 2023, even though he would otherwise have continued to be employed on the same generous terms (which included expatriate allowances) until July 2024. The Father initially claimed that he was “compelled to leave” the Singapore Employer, but admitted during cross-examination that there was no evidence in his affidavit (of evidence in chief) to support this claim. The Father alleged instead that the Mother had gone on a “smear campaign”, that the Father was “questioned by [his] superiors about having an affair with a direct report and giving the person promotions and bonuses”, and that the Father was convinced that had he stayed longer, his employment would have been terminated because of the reputational damage caused by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In January 2024, the Father left Singapore and moved to Canada. This halted the progress of MSS 2240/2023. After the Father failed to attend a Court Mention on 31 January 2024, a Warrant of Arrest was issued against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 16 April 2024, the Mother commenced FC/D 1729/2024 to dissolve the parties’ marriage on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably because the Father had committed adultery and the Mother found it intolerable to live with the Father. The Father applied to stay the divorce proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, but the Father’s application was dismissed on 23 September 2024. After an Interim Judgment was granted in the divorce proceedings on 6 November 2024, the Father resumed participation in MSS 2240/2023, and the Warrant of Arrest was cancelled on 5 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother’s case is summarised in the closing submissions filed by her solicitors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother alleged that the Father had failed to provide reasonable maintenance for her and the 4 Children since August 2023, when the Father left the matrimonial home. She highlighted that the Father had admitted, during cross-examination, that he had not paid any sum of money to her between November 2023 and May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Mother admitted that the expenses claimed were higher than those of an average family in Singapore, she claimed that this was because of the high standard of living enjoyed by the family, and that the Father had initially offered to pay her a monthly allowance of $20,000 in addition to directly paying the Children’s school fees and school bus fees, and the family’s rent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother claimed that the Father was a man of substantial earning capacity and means, and had downplayed his current monthly income from his current employer (the “Canada Employer”). In addition to monthly income, the Father also stood to receive bonuses as high as CAD 309,375 to be paid in 2026. While employed by the Singapore Employer, the Father was earning an annual income of $860,193. Yet the Father voluntarily resigned from the Singapore Employer in October 2023, shortly after he was served with MSS 2240/2023, so as to avoid his maintenance obligations. The Father made a bare allegation that the Mother started a smear campaign against him and forced his resignation from the Singapore Employer, and did not produce a shred of evidence that the Mother had badmouthed him or contacted his colleagues/employers before his resignation on 9 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother claimed that the Father had sufficient financial resources to pay the maintenance sought by the Mother. The assets in the Father’s sole name were slightly under $2 million. The Mother claimed that the Father had transferred sums totalling more than $1 million to W, with a view to depleting his assets to defeat a maintenance claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In response to the Father’s suggestion that the family move to Canada, where schooling and healthcare are free, the Mother pointed out that only public schooling is free, and observed that the school fees of private schools in Canada are similar to international school fees in Singapore. The Mother also highlighted that the Children had been residing and studying in Singapore for most of their lives, that the 3rd and 4th Children had never lived in Canada, and that the 1st and 2nd Children had not lived in Canada since 2011.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Since May 2025, the Father paid approximately $5,500 per month as maintenance for the Mother and the 4 Children. (The actual amount transferred by the Father each month was CAD 6,000.) This was insufficient. The Mother observed that the Father had claimed that his own expenses were CAD 6,810 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father’s case is summarised in the closing submissions filed by his solicitors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father claimed that there was lack of clarity in what the Mother was claiming, and that he was not made aware of the expenses incurred. The Father also claimed that the expenses incurred by the Mother and the Children were inflated, unreasonable and/or “duplicitous”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father highlighted, for instance, the Mother’s expenditure on her nails and cosmetic treatments, braces for the 1st Child, flights and vacations, and Formula One race tickets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father highlighted that the Mother, despite having a car, claimed taxi expenses of $400 per month, as well as Grab transfer expenses of $1,080 per month, MRT expenses of $365 per month, and school bus expenses of $500 per month, for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father pointed out that the Mother made dubious and unsubstantiated claims for the household, such as $750 per month for “Devices wear and tear / replacement”, to artificially drive up the purported family expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Mother claimed CAD 19,309.53 for medical insurance. The Father was not informed of this expense before it was incurred, and did not consent to this expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a-p3_v\"></a>(v)       The Father also complained that after the lease at the family’s previous accommodation expired, the Mother and Children moved into more expensive accommodation, resulting in an increase in the monthly rent from $6,500 to $8,000, and that the Mother was “so cavalier in her spending” that she overpaid her landlord $5,000 in rent on 12 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father disputed the Mother’s claim of hardship necessitating interim maintenance. The Father highlighted that the Mother had transferred CAD 169,800 from the parties’ joint account to her personal account. The Father also highlighted that the Mother had declared, in her Affidavit of Means filed on 7 March 2025 for the divorce proceedings, that she had at least 11 bank accounts in Canada, 2 DBS Bank accounts and 1 Citibank account. The Father claimed that the Mother had a Canadian private banking account, and that this implied that the Mother had at least CAD 1 million in investable assets. The Father claimed that the Mother had drawn down the total in her bank accounts from $858,695.97 to $222,682.27 in less than 12 months. The Father also claimed that the Mother could obtain loans from her parents, sister and friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father claimed that it was unreasonable for the Mother to refuse to return to Canada with the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father claimed that the parties’ stay in Singapore was temporary and premised on his job in Singapore, and that the parties had all along intended to return to Canada after the Father ceased work in Singapore. The Father highlighted that the parties retained their matrimonial home in Canada, that both parties’ families resided in Canada, and that the Mother retained many personal assets (including the majority of her bank accounts) in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband pointed out that as the Mother and the 4 Children were Canadian citizens, transport, healthcare and education would be free for them in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Even if the Husband had remained employed with the Singapore Employer, his expatriate allowances would have ceased by July 2024, and this was made known to the Wife. There was therefore no basis for the Mother to insist on remaining in Singapore with the 4 Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       From 1 September 2025, the 1st Child would have access to funds in his Education Savings Plan for his university expenses. The 1st Child will no longer have to be maintained by the Father after the 1st Child turned 19 years of age in November 2025, and would have access to a rounded sum of CAD 75,000 from the 1st Child’s Education Savings Plan. The sum of CAD 75,000 was sufficient to cover the 1st Child’s educational expenses, on-campus residence, meals and miscellaneous fees for a 3-year course, and any shortfall for a 4-year course can be made good by an education loan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c-p3_v\"></a>(v)       As the Father no longer worked in Singapore, the Mother was in Singapore on a Long-Term Visit Pass dependent on the Children’s Student Passes. The 1st Child was now in Singapore on a Social Visit Pass, as his Student Pass has expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father claimed that there was no neglect or refusal by him to pay reasonable maintenance. The Father claimed to have paid for various expenses incurred from August 2023 to March 2025, and to have transferred the sum of CAD 6,000 per month to the Mother in April and May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Father claimed that the Mother had the means and resources to maintain herself. He highlighted that the Mother had a Master’s degree in psychiatry and a postgraduate diploma in counselling psychology, and was able to practise as a counsellor in Singapore. The Father observed that the Children were no longer so young as to require the Mother’s full attention, and that the Mother also had a domestic helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_f\"></a>(f)     It was only after extensive attempts to secure employment that the Father found permanent employment in Canada, first with a different employer (the “Interim Employer”) and then with the Canada Employer. Under the Canada Employer, the Father earned an annual base salary of CAD 275,000 (or a gross monthly income of CAD 22,916.66). After mandatory deductions and income tax of 46.16% are deducted, the Father’s net take home pay was CAD 10,952.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As the Mother commenced divorce proceedings in FC/D 1729/2024 after the commencement of MSS 2240/2023, and an Interim Judgment has been granted in those divorce proceedings, MSS 2240/2023 has become in substance an application for interim maintenance pending a final decision on the divorce ancillary matters in FC/D 1729/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The provisions directly relevant to MSS 2240/2023 are sections 68 and 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 imposes a duty on a parent “to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, ... either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Under section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961, the Court “may, on the application of a wife, and on due proof that her husband has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her, order the husband to pay monthly sums or a lump sum for the maintenance of that wife”. Under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961, the Court “may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his or her child who is unable to maintain himself or herself, order that parent to pay monthly sums or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child”. Under section 69(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961, an application for the maintenance of a child may be made by any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child. In this case, the Mother had care and control of all 4 Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Under section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961, the Court, when ordering maintenance for a wife or a child, “is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case”, including (to the extent that they are relevant to this case) the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the financial needs of the wife or child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the standard of living enjoyed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       by the wife before her husband neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her;

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the provisions of Part 8 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (which include sections 68 and 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961) apply, with the necessary modifications, to any such application for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Assessment of Father’s means</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Court often takes into account a person’s monthly income when determining the extent to which the person is able to provide reasonable maintenance for the person’s spouse or child. However, this is by no means the only consideration. Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 requires the Court to have regard to a parent’s “means and station in life” when considering what constitutes reasonable maintenance for a child. Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 requires the Court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case” when determining the amount of maintenance to be ordered for a spouse or child. As illustrated in section 114(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, “all the circumstances of the case” would also include (in addition to the person’s income) the person’s earning capacity, the person’s property, and any other financial resources which the person has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future. The Court must view holistically the person’s financial resources, so that any maintenance payable by the person is not skewed by how the person’s remuneration package is organised. Further, where a person is clearly able to earn a substantial income, the Court should not infer too readily from any temporary unemployment experienced by the person that the person is thereby unable to provide maintenance, or that there has been a material change in the person’s circumstances to justify a reduction in any maintenance that the person is liable to provide. Otherwise, job resignation will become a convenient excuse to justify the adjustment of maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I now turn to consider the Father’s means. The Father is, and was at all material times, clearly able to earn a substantial income. The Father chose to resign on 9 October 2023, shortly after the commencement of MSS 2240/2023 on 2 October 2023. For the purposes of determining the extent of the Father’s obligations to provide reasonable maintenance for the Mother and the Children, I accept that until the Father was employed by the Canada Employer on 15 October 2024, his earning capacity should be based on his income while he was employed by the Singapore Employer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is not disputed that the Father resigned from the Singapore Employer on 9 October 2023. The Father did not provide any objective evidence (such as any communication from the Singapore Employer) suggesting that he was liable to have his employment terminated by the Singapore Employer. While the Father alleged that he was “compelled to leave” the Singapore Employer because the Mother had spread rumours of the parties’ personal lives and separation to his colleagues, he did not produce any independent evidence that the rumours (if any) were in fact started by the Mother. While the Father exhibited, in his affidavit of evidence in chief, certain communications emanating from the Mother or her solicitors that the Father might consider objectionable, all of those communications were in fact written after the Father had resigned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Even if the Mother had publicly shamed the Father before his resignation, and the public shaming embarrassed the Father and contributed to his decision to resign, this did not make the Father’s resignation any less voluntary. As the Father chose to resign, his resignation was voluntary, and the termination of his employment pursuant to his notice of resignation did not affect his earning capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father knew that he had a continuing obligation to maintain his family. The responsible thing for the Father to do would have been to take steps to secure a new role that would have enabled him to provide an appropriate level of financial support for his family, before resigning from the Singapore Employer. Instead, he chose to reduce his financial support for the family, and to resign from a role that came with generous terms (which included expatriate allowances).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Father resigned, he was placed on garden leave until 8 January 2024, as he was required to serve 3 months’ notice under his employment contract. The Singapore Employer’s letter to the Father acknowledging receipt of his notice of resignation (exhibited at pages 43 to 48 of his affidavit of evidence in chief) stated that he would continue to be paid his salary and be provided with contractual benefits in the usual way until his last day of employment. While the Singapore Employer may have withheld the Father’s salary during the notice period to satisfy the Father’s Singapore income tax obligations, this did not detract from the fact that the Father in substance continued to be employed by the Singapore Employer until 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Father was not precluded, by his contract of employment with the Singapore Employer, from applying for suitable employment during his garden leave. However, it is unclear what attempts (if any) the Father made to secure suitable employment between the date of his resignation from the Singapore Employer and March 2024, The Father did not provide any evidence of his attempts apart from some short messages exchanged with 3 job recruiters in October and November 2023 that did not name any specific role. While the Father exhibited, at pages 64 to 94 of his affidavit of evidence in chief, several acknowledgments that the Father had applied for a new role, or reached out to a job recruiter, the earliest of these acknowledgments was dated 17 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_f\"></a>(f)     While the Father secured employment with the Interim Employer on 22 July 2024, I did not consider his remuneration during his tenure at the Interim Employer to be a true reflection of his earning capacity. The income that the Father would have earned annually at the Interim Employer was significantly less than both the Father’s annual income with the Singapore Employer and the Father’s annual income with the Canada Employer. The fact that the Father left his role at the Interim Employer less than 3 months after he started work there suggests that the Father himself did not consider his remuneration with the Interim Employer to be a true reflection of his earning capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_g\"></a>(g)     It was only when the Father started working with the Canada Employer on 15 October 2024 that one can sensibly conclude that there was a genuine reduction in the Father’s earning capacity. This was a role, comparable in seniority to the Father’s role in the Singapore Employer, that the Father finally settled on after making genuine attempts to find appropriate employment in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father is not beholden to work at the Singapore Employer just to support the standard of living chosen by the Mother for herself and the Children. There is also no evidence that the Singapore Employer would have continued to employ the Father at the same, or similar, generous terms after July 2024. Once the Father began employment by the Canada Employer on 15 October 2024, the Father’s earning capacity must be recalibrated according to what he was paid by the Canada Employer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the purposes of the interim maintenance payable under MSS 2240/2023, the Father’s earning capacity must be based on the Father’s actual income (inclusive of actual bonuses) earned in 2024 and 2025, and not based on projected income and bonuses to be paid in 2026 or later. If and when the Father’s income and bonuses are increased in 2026 or later, that may constitute a material change in circumstances justifying a variation of any maintenance ordered under MSS 2240/2023. For the present purposes, I would treat the Father’s employment income over the period of 12 months starting in October 2024 as comprising at least an annual base salary of CAD 275,000, a guaranteed bonus of CAD 60,000 and an annual equity award of CAD 100,000, amounting to a total of CAD 435,000. In subsequent years, the guaranteed bonus of CAD 60,000 will be replaced by other bonuses, such as the Annual Incentive Plan. It appears from the Father’s Earnings Statements issued by the Canada Employer for the periods 16 to 31 October 2024 and 1 to 15 November 2024 that a sum of CAD 3,919.87 was deducted at source for income tax every half month from the Father’s employment income while the Father was employed by the Canada Employer. Therefore, in the 12 months starting in October 2024, the Father’s income tax deducted upfront from his salary would be CAD 94,076.88, and the Father’s annual employment income (net of those taxes) while the Father was employed at the Canada Employer would be about CAD 340,923.12. To avoid doubt, this is only an estimate of the Father’s annual earning capacity while employed by the Canada Employer, and is used only to guide the Court in determining what may constitute reasonable maintenance for the Mother and the Children, when taking a holistic view of the Father’s financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I note from the Father’s Income Tax Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2024 that the Father’s employment income with the Singapore Employer in 2023 (after deduction of expenses) was $860,193, and that the tax payable by the Father on income earned in 2023 was $164,004.39. Therefore, the Father’s income in 2023 (net of income tax) would be about $696,188.61.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As the Father’s employment income in 2023 would include bonuses, the Father’s monthly income would have been considerably less than the $71,912.83 alleged by the Mother. Even though the Father’s employment income while employed by the Singapore Employer (net of income tax) was substantial, mathematically, it would not be feasible to sustain indefinitely the Mother’s grossly inflated claim for maintenance amounting to $52,803.89 per month, in addition to rent, school fees for the 4 Children, and school bus fees for the 2 younger Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Calculation of reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     When MSS 2240/2023 was commenced, the Mother was a homemaker, the 4 Children were full-time students in international schools, and all of them were in Singapore on Dependant’s Passes linked to the Father’s Employment Pass. These Dependant’s Passes were cancelled when the Father ceased to be employed in Singapore. To enable the Children to continue their studies in Singapore, the Mother obtained Student Passes for the Children, and a Long-Term Visit Pass (as a parent of children studying in Singapore) for herself. It is not disputed that the Mother has been a homemaker from the time the family moved to Singapore in 2013. The Mother’s Dependant’s Pass and Long-Term Visit Pass did not entitle her to work in Singapore. It was therefore incumbent on the Father to maintain the Mother and the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I found on the evidence that the Father did not adequately maintain the Mother and the Children from September 2023 onwards, even though he made certain payments from time to time (which must be set off against any backdated maintenance that is ordered). It was clear from the evidence that the Father did not remit any money to the Mother for the maintenance of the Mother and the Children from December 2023 to March 2025. While the Father did contribute to the maintenance of the Mother and the Children from September to November 2023, and from April 2025 onwards, I did not think that the amounts contributed by the Father were sufficient to cover the reasonable expenses of the Mother and the Children. In the circumstances, I thought it was reasonable to backdate the payment of maintenance to September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     While I accept that the Mother and the Children are Canadian citizens, and that it may cost less for the Children to be educated in Canada, the fact remains that the Children have been in Singapore since 2013. When MSS 2240/2023 was commenced in October 2023, all 4 Children were attending international schools in Singapore. While relocation to Canada is a possibility, that would involve some disruption and adjustment. I therefore formed the view that it would be in the interests of the Children to continue their education in Singapore, and consequently for the Mother to remain with the Children in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     That said, I found the expenses listed by the Mother to be inflated and somewhat extravagant. Most of the line items were not supported by any documentary evidence. After several rounds of submissions and clarifications from the parties, I decided that if the Mother and the Children are to continue living in Singapore on the basis that the Children continue to attend international schools and participate in the enrichment activities that they are accustomed to, the reasonable monthly expenses of the Mother and the Children would be as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Rent - $6,500 (September 2023 to April 2024); $8,000 (May 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Groceries and household cleaning supplies - $2,500;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Utilities - $800;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Other household expenses - $1,500;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Helper’s expenses - $1,450 (September 2023 to April 2024); $1,230 (May 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Car expenses - $1,500;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_g\"></a>(g)     1st Child’s school fees - $4,073.25 (September to December 2023); $4,579.00 (January 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_h\"></a>(h)     1st Child’s other expenses - $3,000;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_i\"></a>(i)     2nd Child’s school fees - $3,896.25 (September to December 2023); $4,304.50 (January 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_j\"></a>(j)     2nd Child’s other expenses - $3,000;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_k\"></a>(k)     3rd Child’s school fees - $3,710 (September to December 2023); $3,925 (January 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_l\"></a>(l)     3rd Child’s school bus - $250.61;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_m\"></a>(m)     3rd Child’s other expenses - $3,000;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_n\"></a>(n)     4th Child’s school fees - $3,652.50 (September to December 2023); $3,864.17 (January 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_o\"></a>(o)     4th Child’s school bus - $250.61;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_p\"></a>(p)     4th Child’s other expenses - $2,500; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_q\"></a>(q)     Mother’s personal expenses - $3,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As the Children’s school fees were paid by semester, for the purposes of calculating each Child’s school fees, the fees paid for all semesters in a year were added together to arrive at an annual amount, and the annual amount was divided by 12 months, in order to arrive at a monthly amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In determining what constitutes reasonable maintenance for the Children, I noted that a parent’s duty under section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to maintain his or her child extends only to providing the child with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable. It does not extend to sending the child on a holiday. It is also doubtful whether a failure to sponsor a holiday would constitute a neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance. Therefore, I did not make any provision for family vacation expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In calculating the monthly expenses attributable to the Mother and each Child, I divided the following communal expenses equally among the Mother and the 4 Children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Rent - $6,500 (September 2023 to April 2024); $8,000 (May 2024 onwards);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Groceries and household cleaning supplies - $2,500;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Utilities - $800;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Other household expenses - $1,500; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Helper’s expenses - $1,450 (September 2023 to April 2024); $1,230 (May 2024 onwards).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Assuming that the Father had paid the rent for the period September to December 2023, the portion of the communal expenses attributed to each person was calculated as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the period September to December 2023: $(2,500 + $800 + 1,500 +1,450)/5 = $6,250/5 = $1,250.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the period January to April 2024: $(6,500 + 2,500 + $800 + 1,500 +1,450)/5 = $12,750/5 = $2,550.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the period May 2024 onwards: $(8,000 + 2,500 + $800 + 1,500 +1,230)/5 = $14,030/5 = $2,806.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As the car was used primarily by the Mother, I treated the car expenses as the Mother’s expenses, even though the car may be used to transport the Children from time to time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Assuming that the Father had paid the rent, the school fees for all 4 Children, and the school bus fees for the 2 younger Children, from September to December 2023, I assessed the monthly expenses attributable to the Mother and each Child as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"

informed that the 1st Child began studies in the United Kingdom in September 2025, and now returns to Singapore on a Social Visit Pass. However, I do not propose to further adjust these figures for monthly expenses for the period from September 2025 onwards. This is because the 1st Child’s portion of the communal expenses will still be incurred while the 1st Child is away. The 1st Child will also have to incur his own rent and other expenses, and pay for any tertiary education fees not covered by his Education Savings Plan. There was also no material before me to enable me to make an informed decision on how the monthly expenses of the Mother and the 4 Children should be adjusted to account for the 1st Child’s studies abroad. As this concerns matters that occurred after the conclusion of the trial for MSS 2240/2023, in order to preserve the parties’ rights to rely on this as a material change in the circumstances, I gave the parties liberty to apply to vary the amount of maintenance payable from September 2025 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Following the norm in maintenance awards, and for ease of calculation, I rounded the amounts to be awarded as maintenance. For the period September 2023 to September 2024, I rounded the figures for monthly expenses downwards to the nearest $100, to encourage financial prudence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As there appeared to be a genuine decrease in the Father’s earning capacity from October 2024, when he started work at the Canada Employer, the Mother would have to contribute to the maintenance of the Children, and reduce her reliance on the maintenance provided by the Father, if she wished to continue with the same standard of living. While the Mother is unable to work in Singapore so long as she relies on a Long-Term Visit Pass to remain in Singapore, there is evidence that she is not without means and even has a private banking relationship with a Canadian financial institution. The Mother also has educational qualifications that may enable her to find suitable employment in Singapore if she obtains an Employment Pass. Having regard to the Father’s reduced earning capacity, and the Mother’s choice to raise the Children in Singapore, it was only fair that both parties should contribute equally to the maintenance of the Mother and the Children from October 2024 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore ordered that the Father bear 100% of the maintenance amount from September 2023 to September 2024, but only 50% of the maintenance amount from October 2024 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The amounts of maintenance payable by the Father from September 2023 to September 2025 (had he not contributed any amount to the maintenance of the Mother and the 4 Children during that period) are therefore as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\"

clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Mother also claimed that the Father did not pay a total of one month’s rent in November and December 2023. This was not denied by the Father’s solicitors in their reply filed on 26 September 2025. Therefore, I assessed the total amount of maintenance that would have been payable by the Father for the period September 2023 to September 2025 (had he not made any maintenance payments during that period) as $788,300, calculated as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>$[(20,500 x 4) + (45,700 x 4) + (47,000 x 5) + (23,500 x 12) + 6,500] = $(82,000 + 182,800 + 235,000 + 282,000 + 6,500) = $788,300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I deal next with the amount of maintenance already paid by the Father. The Mother admitted that the Father had paid a total of $129,553.94,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> comprising the following amounts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $27,762 (being the S$ equivalent of the total of CAD 30,000 that the Father had paid as monthly payments of maintenance from 30 April to 29 August 2025, converted at an exchange rate of S$0.9254 to CAD 1);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $31,878.00 (tuition fees for the 1st Child and 2nd Child for January 2024 to March 2024, paid in August 2023);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $11,000 (paid on 2 September 2023);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     $8,732.20 (paid on 2 October 2023);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     $300 (Helper’s levy paid on 16 October 2023);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     $5,706.74 (payment for credit card on 21 November 2023); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_g\"></a>(g)     $44,175 (tuition fees for 3rd Child and 4th Child paid in November 2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     To these, I would add the credit card payment of $10,004.79 on 13 September 2023, the maid levy payment of $300 on 14 September 2023, and the British Club payment of $1,967.80 on 28 September 2023. These were amounts that the Mother would have been required to pay in September 2023 if they had not been paid by the Father. Regardless whether these were expenses incurred in August 2023, they fell due only in September 2023. By paying these expenses on behalf of the Mother, the Father freed the Mother from paying these expenses. The Father was therefore in substance maintaining the Mother in September 2023 when he made those payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I would also add the car insurance payment of $557.28 paid on 15 August 2023. This was clearly a prepayment that allowed the Mother to enjoy the benefit of the car from September 2023 to August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Lastly, I would add the security deposit of $12,000, which the Father had paid for the premises previously used as the family home. As the Mother had moved out of those premises in mid-March, before the end of the tenancy in April 2024, the security deposit was used to settle the rent for March and April 2024 and could not be recovered from the landlord.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Adding these sums, the amount of maintenance already contributed by the Father, whether in form or in substance, amounted to a total of $154,383.81.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the circumstances, I assessed the outstanding balance of the maintenance payable by the Father for the period September 2023 to September 2025 to be $633,916.19 (calculated by deducting $154,383.81 from $788,300).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In determining the amount of maintenance payable by the Father, I disregarded the withdrawal by the Mother of the sum of CAD 169,800 from the parties’ joint account in November 2023, as that sum is a matrimonial asset that the Mother will have to account for in FC/D 1729/2024. Similarly, I disregarded the sums that the Father had transferred to W, and the sums transferred back to the Father by W, as the Father would likewise have to account for those sums as matrimonial assets in the divorce proceedings. Suffice to say, it appears from the cash flows between the Father and W that the Father has sufficient financial resources to pay maintenance for the Mother and the Children at a rate commensurate with his earning capacity while employed by the Singapore Employer, even in the months when he was unemployed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

The Mother was represented by Mr Mark Cheng. The Son was self-represented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial and reserved judgment. My decision was delivered on 10 October 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The essence of this dispute was that the Mother could no longer tolerate living together with her Son given his living habits and bad temper. She thus brought the present application in SSP 316 of 2025 (“SSP 316”). She sought a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”), as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was plain to me that the real objective of the Mother’s application in SSP 316 was to obtain the DEO so as to exclude the Son entirely from the flat. The architecture of the provisions relating to family violence in the Women’s Charter make it clear that the court only has the power to grant a DEO in the event a PPO has been granted: s 60B(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found that a PPO should be granted in the present case. For one, it was, in my judgment, likely that the Son would commit family violence on the Mother. Specifically, I found that he would, in all likelihood, lash out at the Mother if she were to do things in the house that were not to his liking. Indeed, on the Son’s own evidence, he would get angry when the Mother would not shut the windows when second-hand cigarette smoke wafted over from the neighbouring unit. He also said his temper flared up when his Mother had forgotten to close a bottle of expensive vitamins he had bought for her on a few occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Anger alone, in the ordinary course of things, would be insufficient to establish the likelihood of family violence. It is human, all too human, to feel anger when our boundaries have been crossed. The evidence in the present case, however, does show that the Son would act on his anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       First, it was quite clear that the Son would go to extreme lengths to minimise or avoid the risks posed by second-hand smoke. This was evident, not only from the work he had done around the house to keep out second-hand smoke, the complaint he had filed to National Environment Agency about the neighbours smoking, but also in his testimony where he described how he would continually try to explain to the Mother, the perils of second and third hand smoke.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Second, the evidence also showed that the Son had indeed lashed out at the Mother. The Mother had, in her affidavit, recounted an incident on 19<sup>th</sup> October 2024. She had left the window open. The Son was enraged. He entered her room, grabbed her arm and pulled her into the kitchen, claiming that she was letting in cigarette smoke and that in so doing, she would increase the risk of cancer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       When confronted by Mr Cheng in cross-examination, about whether he had grabbed the Mother’s arm and brought her to the kitchen, the Son’s response is telling: he first claimed he was “not sure” if he had grabbed her arm, then said he definitely held her hand, before attempting to clarify with Mr Cheng what he had meant by his question. The Son, however, did admit that he was angry and that he had asked the Mother to “come and smell this”. Given the Son’s testimony, I accept the Mother’s account of what had happened in this incident on 19<sup>th</sup> October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In addition to this incident, the Son had also admitted that he would, in a fit of anger, “vent out”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He explained that he would shout as an “outward expression” because he had the “habit of doing that to [his] family members” since he was growing up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It was thus clear to me that the Son was likely to inflict family violence on the Mother, namely, that he would likely either verbally abuse or physically confront her in the event that she had done something in the house that was not to his liking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Having found that the Son was likely to inflict family violence on the Mother, I also found it necessary to order a PPO for the Mother’s personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is well-established that in assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court assesses the risk of future family violence being committed on the person sought to be protected under the order. There was, in my judgment, a heightened risk of this happening – that is because both the Mother and the Son still continue to live together in the same flat. While the both of them had given evidence of their intention and efforts to find separate housing arrangements, the reality was that none of their plans had been firmed up and cast in stone. Their present living arrangement will thus go on, and with it, only create further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having concluded that a PPO should be granted, I turn now to consider the necessity of ordering a DEO. Given that a DEO may only be ordered in the event a PPO is granted, this implies that the purpose of a DEO is to deal with situations where a PPO alone does not go far enough to ensure the protection or personal safety of the person protected under the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In this vein, there was the question of whether a DEO was necessary given that the Mother was the legal owner of the flat, and would therefore be able to exclude the Son from the flat by simply exercising her property rights.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Mr Cheng alluded to the fact that the Mother had neither the presence or the authority to persuade the Son to move out, and that she had already tried, and failed. Mr Cheng also highlighted that sending the Son an eviction notice might be an exercise in futility as the Son would be resistant to moving out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     This question of whether a DEO should be ordered in cases where the person sought to be protected by the DEO is able to, <em>qua</em> legal owner, effectively achieve the same outcome was not a point that I had to decide in the present case. That is because I did not find that the Mother had demonstrated the necessity of a DEO. The Mother stated, in her own affidavit, that her Son’s actions had somewhat toned down with the issuance of an Expedited Order (“EO”) (which is, for all intents and purposes, a temporary PPO issued until the application can be heard by the court – see s 61 of the Women’s Charter 1961). It thus appears that a PPO would be sufficient to ensure her personal safety and protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I would also add that the evidence before me only went so far as to show that there were clashes between her and the Son over their daily living arrangements in the flat.

He sought a PPO to protect both himself and the two sons (“A” and “B”) against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 2272/2024 was the Mother’s application against the Father. She too sought a PPO to protect herself and the two sons against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Judgment was delivered on 20 August 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both applications were filed prior to the 2nd of January 2025. There can therefore be no quarrel that the provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 relating to family violence which were in force prior to that date apply to the present applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       To succeed in their respective applications for a PPO, the Father and the Mother had to establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, that the respondent had either committed family violence, or was likely to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, that it was necessary for the court to grant the PPO for the protection of the persons for whom the order was sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It also goes without saying, and this is well-established in our case law, that the point of such orders is to protect, and not to punish respondents for any acts of family violence that they may have committed: <em>XQW v XQV and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33780-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 91</a> at [1] citing <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a>; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [19(b)(i)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Both the Father and the Mother mainly rely on an incident that had taken place on 19 November 2024 to support their respective applications. The both of them, however, presented slightly accounts of what had transpired that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This was the Father’s account. He said that he had caught the Mother red-handed having an affair with her ex-boyfriend. He confronted the Mother. He threatened to divorce her. This provoked the Mother. She became agitated. As a result, the quarrel escalated. The Mother had, allegedly, taken B, and tried to throw him off the balcony. The Father stepped in to restrain her. The Father gained control of B. It was then that the Mother tried to attack A. The Father called in his father-in-law and had a word with him about the Mother’s psychiatric issues. According to the Father, he thought that the reason the Wife was acting up was due to her mental condition. The police were eventually called in, but no action was taken as it was a family issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother, on the other hand, did not deny meeting her ex-boyfriend on that day. What she did deny, was that she was having an affair with him, or that she slept with him on that day. She said they talked. After they finished their conversation, her ex-boyfriend drove her home. When she returned home, she got into an argument with the Father who was badgering her for the baby bonus money. During their discussion, the Father discovered that the Mother had met up with her ex-boyfriend. He was enraged. The argument escalated. The Father alleged that the Mother had gone to a hotel with her ex-boyfriend. He began to beat her. The Mother alleges that it was the Father who had threatened to throw their son from the balcony, and not her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Based on the evidence put before me, the most that can be said was that there was a quarrel between the Father and the Mother. In this regard, I find the Mother’s recounting of events, specifically, that the reason for their heated quarrel was because the Father had discovered that the Mother had met up with her ex-boyfriend, to be more plausible as opposed to the Father’s account. That was because the Father did not strike me as a man who would let such a thing slide. Insofar as both the Father and the Mother accused each other of trying to throw B off the balcony, there was nothing to support or corroborate their respective accounts. The most that can be said, therefore, is that both their sons were likely caught up amidst their domestic quarrel, and unfortunately, had to witness both their parents fighting. This, however, did not mean that family violence had been inflicted on both sons by either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Apart from this incident, the Father also raised the issue of the Mother’s psychiatric condition. To support his assertion that the Mother had a psychiatric condition, he pointed me to a referral letter from Hospital R. That letter states that the Mother had been admitted for “new onset psychosis” and that she was following up with Hospital R’s psychiatric department. The letter, however, does not state the severity of the Mother’s condition, nor does it detail how her condition would affect those around her, namely, the Father as well as their two sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In short, the evidence before me does not go so far as to establish that the Mother’s alleged psychiatric condition was so severe such that it could be concluded that she was likely to commit family violence on either her two sons, or the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Finally, the last major point which the Father had raised was in relation to an incident where the Mother had allegedly pushed A down the stairs. The Father had attached a report from A’s playschool. That report states that A had been observed limping. The teacher asked A what had happened. A said that the Mother had pushed him down the stairs. The teacher was taken aback. She shared it with the school principal. The Mother stated that A was fine and did not have any fall at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition to the report, a series of screenshots were also produced. Those screenshots contained text messages which corroborated the report from the school. These screenshots were sent in a group chat which included both the Father, the Mother and the school teachers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I note that the Mother had indeed texted the group chat to state that A was fine and did not have any fall at home. This was, however, quite different from what she had stated in her testimony. She recounted, when asked why A would accuse her of pushing him down the stairs, that A had tripped over a small bicycle. She was adamant that she remembered this incident. But if this was indeed the case, and the Mother knew that A was limping because he had tripped over a bicycle, why did she not simply communicate this on the group chat? Instead – she said, on the group chat, that A was fine and that he did not have any fall at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     While this discrepancy between the Mother’s testimony and what the contemporaneous evidence shows, may suggest that the Mother was, in some way, responsible for A’s limp, the Father’s account is based entirely on what the teachers had told him, which was in turn, entirely based on what A had told them. In other words, the Father’s case that A had indeed been pushed by the Mother is based on hearsay: see <em>XOD v XOC and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33474-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 73</a> at [72]; <em>XJZ v XJY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33006-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 30</a> at [32]. The teachers had not been called as witnesses, and there was therefore no opportunity for the Wife to quiz them on what had actually happened that day and what A had told them. Given this, I did not find that the Father had indeed made out his case that the Mother had pushed A down a flight of stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For completeness, I would also state that I do not find that either the Mother, or the Father, were likely to commit family violence on their children. The evidence showed that while their relationship was a dysfunctional one, their children were not the main targets of their fury, but rather, unfortunate bystanders to their quarrels and fights. For instance, the Mother herself told me that the Father would not hit the children – rather, she had taken out a PPO for her children because she did not want them to keep seeing her being beaten up by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In this connection, I also found that it was not necessary to order a PPO for the protection of the children. As I have mentioned, the evidence did not show that either the Father, or the Mother, posed a threat to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Rather, I found that both the Father and the Mother did, in their own way, care for their sons. For instance, the Mother had shared, in her testimony, the sort of life she envisioned for the both of them, and how she wanted to raise them. The Father had also shared how he would do anything to ensure that both his sons were safe – and that included taking matters into his own hands. In addition, the Father’s witness, who was his sister-in-law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> also gave evidence that the Father had been good towards his children, and that he loved them – I saw no evidence or reason to doubt her testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In short, I did not find that a PPO should be ordered for both children against either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     That being said, I found that a PPO should be ordered for the Mother, against the Father. I found it likely that the Father would commit family violence on the Mother – as I have explained, the Father had told me that he was willing to take matters into his own hands if he thought that his children were in danger. The Mother is currently having custody of the children. I therefore considered it likely that the Father would go to confront the Mother if he thought that his sons were in danger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I would also add that notwithstanding the fact that the Father was currently in prison pursuant to a detention order for secret society activity,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that in no way diminished the necessity of a PPO. In fact, this increased the need for the PPO. For one, while the Father was incarcerated, he had not been able to see the children. It was clear to me that this only served to amplify his existing concerns over their safety which were borne out of the strained relations which he had with the Mother. This, coupled with what the Father had told me, that he was willing to take matters into his own hands, made it clear that a PPO was indeed necessary for the Mother’s personal protection so as to avoid a situation where the Father would make trouble for her upon his release.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the Father’s application for a PPO for himself, I did not see a basis to grant such an order. For one, and in the Father’s own words – he had brought the application mainly because he was concerned for the children’s safety and he did not really see a need for a PPO for himself. In that vein, the incidents that he complained of mainly centered on what he says were acts of family violence that the Mother had committed on the children – I thought it clear from the testimony that I had heard, as well as the evidence put before me, that the Mother had not committed family violence on the Father. In any event, I also did not find it likely that the Mother would commit family violence on him – I gathered from her testimony that she wished to give the Father a wide berth, given the state of her relationship with him. That much was also evident from the access arrangements to the children which are being facilitated by a third party, thereby removing the need for the Mother to come into contact with the Father. In this vein, and for the same reasons, I also did not find it necessary to order a PPO for the Father’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To sum up, I granted the Mother a PPO for herself against the Father. In addition to this, I also ordered that the both of them attend counselling.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at p 57.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at p 12, lns 17 – 18.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Violence"],"date":"2025-12-11","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1722/2024","title":"XVZ v XWA","citation":"[2025] SGFC 133","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34238-SSP.xml","counsel":["The complainant in person","Mathea Lim, Sabrina Chau (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-12-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chua Wei Yuan","html":"<root><head><title>XVZ v XWA</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XVZ <em>v</em> XWA </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34238-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 133</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1722/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">11 December 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chua Wei Yuan </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The complainant in person; Mathea Lim, Sabrina Chau (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XVZ — XWA </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">11 December 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chua Wei Yuan:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is a summons for a personal protection order (“PPO”) and domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) which engages a slightly unusual issue of whether family violence is committed where a respondent does not directly inflict physical violence but whose conduct allegedly affects the tendency of the putative victim to engage in self-injurious behaviour (“SIB”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Applicant (“A”) and the Respondent (“R”) are the father and mother, respectively, of their special needs child, a son (“S”) who turns 16 this year.

In any event, I do not consider that it will turn the result of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether R committed FV on S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In analysing whether R committed FV on S, I have somewhat rearranged the order in which I will address the issues raised:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Confining S to his bedroom (Part of Incident 1)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SIB, in particular, being caused by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Confining S to his bedroom (Part of Incident 1)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bringing S to noisy, enclosed spaces (Incident 4)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Appearing in front of S (Incident 2)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Making S wear a protective helmet for prolonged periods (Incident 3)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Feeding cetirizine and melatonin (Incidents 5–6)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Confining S to his bedroom</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The first complaint is that R confined S to the bedroom on 7 September 2024. According to A, at about 9.00am, R instructed S to enter her bedroom and subsequently closed the door. Thereafter, in the domestic helper’s testimony, screaming and sounds of distress could be heard emanating from the room. S remained in the room with S until about 2.00pm, at which point he exited, exhibiting fresh, visible injuries—a bruised face, and a swollen foot and a limp. According to R, S had stubbed his foot on the wheel of a chair while moving around the room in his agitated state. R says that, as S began engaging in self-injurious behaviour by hitting his own face, R handed S his protective helmet to prevent further injury, and kept S in her bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In my view, the allegation of confinement is not established on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A points out that R’s evidence was inconsistent, as R, on the stand, testified that R entered S’s bedroom. However, this in my view does not turn the case. The crucial point is that there was no direct evidence that R had confined S in any room, <em>ie</em>, that R had prevented S from leaving against S’s will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     A argues that R, when S was in a state of agitation, had decided to handle the situation alone and not involve the domestic helper, and had “isolated” S behind a closed door. However, I do not consider that the cross-examination allows the situation to be fairly characterised as one of “isolation”. In my view, there is no requirement that R enlist the assistance of someone else when S is in a state of agitation, or that R refrain from “isolating” S. These, in my view, are parenting decisions that are improper for the court to interfere with. A also points out that R failed to call as an independent witness the individual whom R says she was having a phone conversation with. While R’s account of events are uncorroborated, A is in no better a position: to begin with, A was not at the scene, and what he relies on is essentially the testimony of his domestic helper, which itself is circumstantial evidence in some ways. Ultimately, A must prove his contentions on the strength of his own case, not on the weakness of R’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Self-injurious behaviour</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I next address the major contention in A’s case—that R acted so as to cause S to engage in self-injurious behaviour. This, A says, amounts to FV. This contention deserves closer examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, it cannot be reasonably argued that conduct which impacts the family member’s self-injurious tendency amounts to wrongful confinement or restraint (<em>ie</em>, para (<em>c</em>) of the definition). I also do not think it normally amounts to wilfully or knowingly placing (or attempting to place) the family member in fear of hurt (<em>ie</em>, para (<em>a</em>) of the definition). This is because the family member is the individual who inflicts the hurt on himself or herself. It would seem somewhat contradictory to claim that the family member at the same time <em>inflicts</em> the hurt on himself/herself, and <em>fears</em> that very hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In principle, it seems possible that such conduct satisfies para (<em>d</em>) of the definition, <em>ie</em>, causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the alleged victim. However, two caveats are in order: first, the conduct must amount to continual harassment; and second, it must be established that the respondent either intended to cause or knew that such continual harassment was likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It might also be that such conduct satisfies para (<em>b</em>) of the definition, <em>ie</em>, causing hurt by an act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt. However, it is in my view too simplistic to say that FV is committed (or, at least, a PPO should be granted), as long as the respondent knows or ought to know that his conduct would <em>ultimately</em> result in hurt being inflicted on the alleged victim via SIB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The riposte to the logic that the conduct satisfies para (<em>b</em>) of the definition (and perhaps even para (<em>d</em>)) is that such hurt amounts to a <em>novus actus interveniens</em>—an intervening act by a third party, in this case the alleged victim himself/herself. Otherwise, the legal burden on the respondent would be unbearably onerous. Take, for example, a case where S starts to injure himself. R, instead of restraining S, shouts “Stop it!” at S, hoping or wishing that would stop his SIB, but knowing that S might very well become agitated and continue/escalate his SIB. If that SIB continues or escalates, this logic would mean that the respondent might be taken have committed FV, simply because she <em>knew</em> that S was likely to engage in SIB. But, it also ought not be the case that as a universal rule a respondent can <em>never</em> be held liable just because the act of hurt is consummated by the alleged victim hurting himself/herself. In my view, to obtain a PPO on the basis of para (<em>b</em>) of the definition, the balance is struck by requiring the complainant to establish something more concrete—specifically:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that there was some <em>loss of control</em> on the part of the alleged victim (in which case it might be said that the SIB was not an intervening act for which the respondent ought not to be held responsible); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the respondent was acting in a way that was <em>calculated</em> to elicit the SIB (in which case it does not lie in the respondent’s mouth to deny that he/she ought to know that the conduct would result in hurt, or at least that that the protection is not necessary).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, these two requirements are necessary to establish FV and the necessity for a PPO. If the requirement as to R’s mental state were any lower, it would mean that the victim’s family members become constrained in the way they attempt to manage the SIB, for fear of the spectre of a PPO looming over them. That, in my view, cannot be correct. Ultimately, a finding of FV can eventually sound in criminal sanctions, and the issuance of a PPO must be based on acts of sufficient gravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn to the facts of the case at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The central failing in A’s case, in my judgment, is the fact that A has not established that R was acting in a way to <em>elicit</em> the SIB (or, for that matter, that R acted knowing that <em>in all likelihood</em> (<em>ie</em>, not merely that it is likely) that SIB would occur). Ultimately, A’s contentions about R’s character and proclivities were, on the evidence, largely bare assertions. Considering that these accusations are grave, because in substance they accuse R of conducting herself with a view to causing her own son to exhibit SIB, I do not consider them to be proven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Next, insofar as A alleges that there were “regular occurrences”, I do not consider that there are sufficient particulars for R to respond to it. In the event, I proceed only on incidents which A alleged happened on specific dates. I turn to the specific allegations for which a specific date was provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   Appearing in front of S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     A says that S began to exhibit distress since March 2023, when R vetoed S’s wishes to pursue his academic and research interests in France. Despite this, R continued to position herself in S’s immediate presence, knowingly exacerbating his condition (rather than removing herself to alleviate S’s distress). The most recent instance of this was at a staycation on 6 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, R cannot have committed FV by placing herself in S’s immediate presence, even if this is indeed a trigger for S’s SIB. To hold otherwise is tantamount to saying that the law requires R to alienate herself from her own son at her son’s wishes. That, in my view, cannot be correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To the extent that A says that R had deliberately timed her appearance to inflict maximum distress and to trigger S’s SIB, A has not sufficiently explained this point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Confining S to his bedroom</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As I explained above, I do not find that R confined S to any bedroom against S’s will on 7 September 2024. Accordingly, the further allegation that such confinement led to S engaging in SIB must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Bringing S to noisy, enclosed spaces</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     A’s case is that R had brought S to restaurants with loud background sounds to deliberately frustrate S and overwhelm S with external stimuli. However, there is no evidence that R’s conduct was calculated to elicit SIB from S, apart from S’s say-so. This is especially given R’s clarification that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     S is habituated to using noise-cancelling headphones in such situations; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     R has developed a routine to help S cope with such situations (where, according to her, the primary source of frustration is the wait for the food rather than the noise).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     There is no specific evidence, for example, that R had rejected quieter locations in favour of louder locations for no reason other than her own whim and fancy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     A argues that R was professionally advised to minimise sensory overload, and she had therefore intentionally subjected S to avoidable distress and self-injury by choosing noisy environments. However, as A notes, R has explained that although S experiences occasional distress, the episodes were short, and easily managed with the helper’s assistance, and calming strategies. Also, R’s position is that regular outings were beneficial for S’s social adaptation. It appears to me that this is simply a clash in parenting styles. In some sense, the analogy to be drawn here is to the management of a mild allergy—in one parent’s opinion, the correct management involves abstinence to avoid an allergic reaction, while in the other parent’s opinion, the correct management involves exposure to build tolerance. I do not think that the fact of professional advice invalidates my analysis. It could very well be—in fact, it appears to be the case—that R sincerely thinks that her management is no less inferior a method than what was professionally advised. It may turn out to be the ill-advised course of action, but, in my view, just because some hurt results from R not observing professional advice does not in and of itself turn the situation into one of FV. In my view, A has far from established in cross-examination that R did not sincerely believe in the logic and efficacy of the way she manages S’s SIB and sensory overloads.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Making S wear a protective helmet for prolonged periods</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     According to A, a therapist hired by R had prescribed a protective helmet for S to wear, to protect himself from the impact of his SIB. He had later specified that the helmet ought to be removed every hour to prevent discomfort. However, R, A says, ignored the guidelines, and instead forced S to wear the helmet for prolonged periods, resulting in an ear infection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my judgment, the evidence fails to disclose FV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     There is insufficient evidence to show on the balance of probabilities that R forced S to don the helmet or to continue wearing it against his will (<em>ie</em>, when he did not want to put it on or when he wanted to take it off). R’s testimony, which was broadly unchallenged, was that S was capable of wearing and taking the helmet off by himself. Given that the helmet both serves a protective function and has a side effect, it seems to me that the proportion of time which S spends with the helmet on or off can be the subject of reasonable disagreement. In fact, the therapist had revised his own recommendation at some point in time. In this regard, even if R did not give express instructions for S to take off the helmet periodically, S could have taken it off if he was uncomfortable. I therefore conclude that R cannot be held to have committed FV against S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Feeding S cetirizine</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A claims that it would be harmful to S to feed him cetirizine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     However, there is no reliable medical evidence for A’s contention. Specifically, there was no letter (or, for that matter, testimony) from any of S’s attending physicians that cetirizine was to be avoided, despite A’s claims that S’s neurologist had cautioned against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In cross-examination, A also conceded that cetirizine and melatonin do not cause direct harm, but instead that it can be—in other words, it runs the risk of—exacerbating any seizures that may happen. A also accepted, at least, that cetirizine may on balance be administered in the case of a serious cold. This must mean that cetirizine has the effect of treating symptoms of cold. The point to be gleaned is that cetirizine is not, as A attempts to persuade upon me, all evil and no good. Instead, cetirizine, like several medications, has its intended therapeutic effects and carries side effects, in this case an increased conditional risk of an adverse event. Its administration can be seen as a risk-reward trade-off, on which there may be reasonable disagreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In this case, S had been recently prescribed cetirizine about 1 month prior to the instance in issue where he was given cetirizine. In other words, a registered medical practitioner has already come to the view that S may consume cetirizine. A claims that the prescribing doctor is a general practitioner who is unaware of S’s history of epilepsy. However, there is little reliable basis for A’s contention, since A was not present at the consultation and is unable to testify as to the doctor’s history-taking and assessment. There is, in the first place, no reliable medical evidence that cetirizine cannot be prescribed for patients susceptible to epilepsy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The documentary evidence shows an exchange between R and her helper indicating that the helper reporting that S had a runny nose and was sneezing, and had a blocked nose, and that R instructed the helper to feed cetirizine only if the sneezing did not clear after 5–10 minutes. Ultimately, it was also not alleged that S suffered any seizures as a result of cetirizine being administered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     A’s contention that R should not be fed cetirizine therefore is really a disagreement with R on how S’s situation should be managed. This is, in my view, clearly not FV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Feeding S melatonin </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     R tendered a prescription for melatonin dated 25 Apr 2022 from KKH, which was less than 1 year before the alleged administration of melatonin. It indicated that it was to be taken pro re nata for sleep disturbance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     A argues that it would be harmful to S to feed him melatonin, based on a memo from Dr Phuah Huan Kee dated 14 August 2024, which opined that in S’s case melatonin may cause exacerbation of seizures. A says that R would have known about this because Dr Phuah had verbally cautioned both A and R in 2016 against giving melatonin to S, after having done an EEG in February 2016 which showed a peak. A also says that R had promised just shortly before giving melatonin that she would no longer give melatonin to S. Against this, R pointed out that Dr Phuah had himself administered melatonin to S. A also says that R deliberately withheld these test results from KKH to procure the melatonin prescription. R, however, said that she did not recall that melatonin was not to be administered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the fact that Dr Phuah had himself administered melatonin to S counts for little. It is common ground that Dr Phuah administered melatonin only once, during the EEG. The point is that it was done under supervision, and that it led to the test results which led Dr Phuah to caution against the use of melatonin. Nonetheless, it is very tenuous to say that R has therefore committed FV. I observe that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Dr Phuah was not here to give evidence. There was nothing in his report that stated that he had advised in 2016 not to feed S melatonin, even though one would assume that he keeps his medical records or notes. In other words, it is possible that Dr Phuah never cautioned against melatonin, or that the EEG findings may no longer be valid after a long passage of time. Although R did not give the EEG findings to the KKH doctors, I do not consider this to be a problem because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There is insufficient evidence to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that R deliberately withheld the EEG with a view to procuring a prescription for melatonin. Much less can it be said that R procured the prescription for melatonin by fraud.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The doctors in KKH are also qualified to practice medicine, and they could have ordered the EEG if they considered it necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If R wanted to feed melatonin, it seems to me that she would have done so on more occasions. Especially if A’s case was that R is prone to feeding medicine without an indication for it, it seems unlikely that R would wait until a seeming reason presented itself to feed R melatonin.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Likewise, it was also not alleged that S suffered any seizures as a result of melatonin being administered. In the circumstances, I take the view that it is clearly not FV to have administered melatonin to S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In the context of managing a child who tends to exhibit SIB, or who has medical susceptibilities, parenting disagreements are only to be expected. However, a court, least of all one seised of the duty to determine whether FV has been committed, is patently the wrong forum to argue over whether family or parenting decisions have been optimised to manage the SIB, or to lay blame for sub-optimal decisions. That is a matter for A and R to sort out between themselves. In the final analysis, this summons really is, and really ought to be, about whether A has established on a balance of probabilities that R has committed FV and, thereafter, whether it is necessary to issue a PPO to protect the putative victim. And, in my judgment, the answer is a clear “no”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the circumstances, the summons is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I order that A pay R costs of the proceedings fixed at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements, in view of the length of the trial, the nature of the allegations, R’s need to react to significant volumes of new material introduced by A on the first day of the trial, and the fact that time was wasted by A calling witnesses who added virtually nothing to the evidence because they lacked personal knowledge on most matters in issue.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Ancillary Matters – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance for ex-spouse/children"],"date":"2025-12-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1150 of 2024","title":"XTM v XTN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 114","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34225-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in person","Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-12-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XTM v XTN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XTM <em>v</em> XTN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34225-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 114</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1150 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 December 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in person; Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XTM — XTN </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance for ex-spouse/children</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 December 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff (wife) and the defendant (husband) were married in Argentina in October of 2009 and have 2 sons.

She is an Italian citizen who was until January 2025, an Executive Director, Global Head (Skills Based Organisation) at a bank in Singapore. She was unfortunately retrenched and was unemployed at the time of the hearing. She declared her last drawn gross monthly income to be S$26 000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The husband is 45 years of age and is an Australian citizen. He works as an Operations Program Manager at the Singapore office of a multinational technology company (Company X). He earns a gross monthly income of S$19 474.67.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       After their marriage, both parties were working in Australia. The wife worked at a business management consultancy and the husband, at a utilities asset company. The husband was earning more than the wife at the time. Their first son was born in 2010, making him 15 years of age at the time of the hearing. The wife’s mother assisted in his care for a few months before the child was cared for at a childcare facility. In August 2011, the husband secured a job at Company X. While the work brought in a healthy income, it took him away from home for almost half of every month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The wife left her job at the business management consultancy in December 2012 and started her own business. The parties soon started to plan their move to Singapore. They believed that the move would afford them a better balance between their commitments at work and home. The husband managed to secure a transfer to Singapore and the family arrived in January 2015. At the time, she was expecting their second child. As the wife had considerable difficulty with previous pregnancies and had suffered miscarriages, it was thought prudent that she did not work during the pregnancy. After the child was born in August 2015, she secured work with a local bank, as Vice-President of Human Resources (HR) and then as Senior Vice-President of People Transformation until September 2021. The couple was assisted by a domestic helper from the time the second child was born. In September 2021, she assumed a new role as Executive Director at another bank. This job provided a significant increase in salary. Unfortunately, her services were terminated from January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       While parties started to face challenges to their marriage from 2018, it was from about 2021 that significant cracks in the relationship began to surface. While the husband was in Australia visiting his family in 2023, the wife asked that he leave their rented premises on his return. He left in May 2023. He continued to contribute to the family expenses until December 2023 by depositing a monthly sum of S$12 500 into the parties’ joint account with DBS. He claims to have stopped providing further as the wife was utilising it to pay towards expenses they had not agreed on, including her credit card bills. Regardless, he continued to pay for the children’s school fees and expenses when they were with him. Finding it difficult to sustain expenses without the husband’s contribution, the wife took out an interim application for maintenance. This was heard and dismissed on 2 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As the rental of the premises the wife and children were staying at was S$13 000 per month and unsustainable, she had at the time of the hearing before me moved to cheaper accommodation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The wife was acting in person but had sought the attendance of a solicitor to assist her during the proceedings. This was permitted with strict parameters drawn on the role of the solicitor during the proceedings. The husband had legal representation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 112 (1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (Charter) provides that a court has the power subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce to order the division between parties of any matrimonial asset in such proportions as the court thinks <em>just and equitable</em>. Section 112 (2) provides a list of non-exhaustive factors to assist a court in determining what would be just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Section 112 (10) provides the definition of a matrimonial asset. In <b><em>USB</em></b> v <b><em>USA and another appeal</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> the court expressed that <em>“…..when a marriage is dissolved, in general all the parties’ assets will be treated as matrimonial assets unless a party is able to prove that any particular asset was either not acquired during the marriage or was acquired through a gift or inheritance and is therefore not a matrimonial asset. The party who asserts that an asset is not a matrimonial asset or that only a part of its value should be included in the pool bears the burden of proving this on the balance of probabilities…</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Sums withdrawn from the DBS joint account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is trite law that substantial sums expended when divorce is imminent must be returned to the pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff called for the court to make a finding that S$80 828.34 was improperly withdrawn by her husband from their joint DBS account without her knowledge and that this sum be returned by the husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The husband made a similar allegation against his wife and said that he stopped contributing a monthly sum of S$12 500 to prevent her from using the monies on expenses they did not agree on.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I did not place the sum indicated by the wife to have been spent by the husband (nor suggested by the husband to be unreasonable expenses of the wife) back into the pool for division. From the evidence, both parties contributed to this account with the understanding that the monies were to be utilised for various expenses of the family. Even though they earned healthy incomes, their expenses were disproportionately high and the substantial spending from this account was by both parties and largely to meet those expenses which snowballed once parties started to live separately and divorce proceedings commenced. The wife alleged that the husband did not explain every withdrawal and appeared to be “cherry-picking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> items he could explain. I did not agree. It is impossible for every expense to be accounted for in a marriage. In this case, a lot of what appears to be large payments relate to credit card bills which in turn relate to unmanaged family expenses and expensive school fees. The husband was able to show that he met many of the family expenses from the joint account and there was no credible suggestion that he was removing or utilising it to avoid a fair division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Joint accounts held with children not drawn into the pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The husband was of the view that the accounts held in the joint names of the children and the wife formed part of the wife’s assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I did not place it into the pool of assets to be divided, not on account of it being a modest collective sum but largely because the intention behind the setting up of these accounts was to provide the children with a resource to meet expenses, if needed. In any event, the husband eventually took the position that these need not be brought into the pool for division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Date of determination of asset value</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties presented 2 different computations of the value of the matrimonial assets, arising significantly from the difference in the date each party proposed as the relevant date for the determination of asset value. In <b><em>ARY</em></b> v <b><em>ARX</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> the court articulated that the default position to determine the pool of matrimonial assets is the date the interim judgment was issued, in this case, 3 April 2024. The court opined that “<em>unless the particular circumstances of justice of the case warrant it, the starting point or default position should be the date that interim judgment is granted</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In the case before me, the husband left the home in May 2023 but had a continuous relationship with the family after this and before the divorce. He contributed financially into the joint account for the children’s expenses after moving out and once that ceased, their school fees and other expenses. Parties even continued to travel as a family. It would be prudent to apply the date of IJ as the effective date of determination of the matrimonial assets. I accepted to a large extent the computation of the husband as provided at Annex C of his final submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The net value of the matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this case, there was no matrimonial home which was purchased by the parties as they had lived together in rented premises throughout their marriage, and separately in rented premises since May 2023. There was no dispute as to the relevance of any pre-marital asset or inheritance which the husband had received. Having determined the issues relating to the disputed assets and the date at which the assets ought to be computed, the value of assets and liabilities closest to the date of IJ is provided at <b>Table 1</b>. While I agree that the values of unvested shares provided by the husband is subject to variables such as the performance of the company and that it may therefore only represent ballpark values on vesting, any loss of value would be borne by both, as would any gain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 1:</b> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"

id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As this was a marriage of 14 years during which time the parties were in full time employment save for brief periods, the structured approach advanced by the Court in <b><em>ANJ</em></b> v <b><em>ANK<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></em></b> was applied. First, a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to the other party was ascribed, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party had made towards the acquisition and improvement of the matrimonial assets. Then, their indirect contributions relative to each other was ascribed a ratio before arriving at an average ratio.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having found that the direct contributions of the parties were approximately in the proportion 38% (wife): 62% (husband),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I turned to their indirect contributions. The husband was of the view that the indirect contributions of the parties were equal. I was of the view that a fairer division ought to be 65:35 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Even as the parties managed their work and household chores without helpers till the birth of their second child in 2015, the wife appears in my view to be the one who was more consistent in providing for the family and whose contribution was of a nature that connoted a larger responsibility when it came to the care of the children. They were both good providers of financial support. The wife’s income relative to the husband’s was larger only from 2021 but it allowed for greater contribution to the family expenses from that time. Her lower pay before 2021 (relative to her husband’s) would also need to be understood in the context of the manner in which the husband dealt with his salary. Deductions from his salary was made to pay for the OCBC SRS account as well as the Superannuation Fund in Australia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This lowered his available salary for family expenses. Notwithstanding, I am of the view that this was less of a concern given that it was accounted for in the pool of assets. The deductions to his salary for the purchase of shares which amounted to almost S$2 000 a month however was of greater relevance as it reduced available income to meet family expenses. The wife’s salary on the other hand was fully applied to meet the family expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Apart from the time the wife was on maternity leave for 4 months and what appears to be a 2-month paternity leave the husband was on after the birth of their first son in 2010, the husband was away substantially every month for work related matters when he was working for Company X in Australia. This was between 2011 and the end of 2014. During these years, the care of the first son would have fallen on the wife, assisted for a brief time by her mother. When the couple arrived in Singapore in 2015 the wife did not work during her pregnancy. During this time, the husband was the sole provider and she would have been with her older child, assisted this time by a domestic helper. However, in 2020 the husband stopped work for a period of about a year which placed the economic responsibility on the wife. The husband claimed that he wanted to homeschool the children during the Covid-19 pandemic which they feared would impact the health of their second son in particular. The wife disagreed with the husband’s reason for ceasing employment and attributed it to the stress that he felt during that time. Regardless of the reason, the family lost income during this period in addition to share entitlements/benefits. The relationship came under intense pressure from 2021 and the husband chose to travel to Australia to be with his brothers. In May 2023 he was asked to leave the home making his contributions to daily care of the children rather more limited for the year prior to April 2024. In essence, approximately 4 of their 14-year marriage saw the husband either travelling for significant periods each month for work or living separately from the children (on account of being told to do so), thus limiting his caregiving. I could not ignore the fact that the wife must have shouldered the responsibility more, at least for those 4 years. As for the remaining years, clearly it can be said, as it can for almost every marriage, that contributions were made by both parents to the care of their children. The husband spoke of having shared equally in the discharge of responsibilities towards the children. The wife did not agree and suggested that he was in fact an absent father. The husband understandably rejected such a position and shared examples of his contribution. He spoke of feeding and putting his first son to sleep after night feeds, taking the children on “scooter rides”, bringing them to parties and to the doctor when his wife could not. These amongst others, were contributions that were taken into consideration. From the affidavits however, it appears that the wife was the one who largely liaised with school, tutors and doctors. The husband stepped in, without any hesitation, but usually when she could not. The husband also appears to prefer the children deciding what was good for them. An example would be drum lessons which the second son had taken. This was to assist in the management of ADHD. It was stopped when the son indicated a lack of interest.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Similarly when the child indicated that he was bored with therapy sessions with a psychologist, the husband was of the view that the child need not attend.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The wife enrolled the child for a sleep study to better address his challenges which the husband did not agree with. Additionally, and more recently, he appears to be more comfortable contributing to the needs of the children if such needs or events occurred during his time with the children. When an appointment the wife made with a Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist for the second child did not fall on his time with the children, he was of the view that the wife should then take him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> While the husband need not take the child each time he is asked to, the position he takes on when he has an obligation to do so, i.e., when he has the child with him, paints a larger picture of compartmentalising duties and how the onus to meet the needs of the children continuously resides with the mother. Insofar as his explanation on why he agreed to cancelling classes the children were not interested in, this could be viewed simply as differing parenting styles. The wife’s view that the children should take on or commit to programmes that would help them manage their ADHD in particular and her commitment to following through with them shows a parent that was willing to do more to address these issues. It would have been easier to allow the children to drop activities they found uninteresting. It may not however be in their best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The husband spoke rather more broadly on the money he had provided to meet the children’s expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> While this is certainly important, both seem to have contributed well with the last 4 years seeing a larger contribution by the wife. The larger disparity between the parties appear to be in their respective contributions to the care and well-being of the children. I was of the view that the wife catered towards this more substantially and greater weight for her indirect contributions was accordingly given. Where both parents work, the amount of time available for their children may not differ materially but the nature of care may well be divergent. Other forms of indirect contribution such as that relating to the wife having assisted the husband to secure work at Company X or planning the logistics of the family’s move to Singapore, were not taken into account in the decision to award her a higher percentage for her indirect contributions. There was little by way of credible evidence to suggest that either did more than the other in these areas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjustments to the average ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Guided by the court in <em>ANJ</em>, I looked at 3 broad categories relating to the length of marriage, the size of the assets and its constituents and the nature of the indirect contributions of the parties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> in addition to several other relevant factors provided under s 112(2) of the Charter in making adjustments to the average ratio and arriving at an appropriate division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Apart from the relevant factors stated in preceding paragraphs, I considered the needs of the children further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The wife suspected that both boys may have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). Assessments indicate that they have the disorder. The second son’s condition appears to be one which requires more attention. The road ahead for the wife who will be caring for their day-to-day needs will require a greater and more involved presence and closer care and engagement with the school and support providers. Additionally, the children were until the time they had to move into their current rented premises, used to a lifestyle more luxurious on account of the fact that both parents were earning healthy incomes. With the loss of employment on the wife’s part, more than half of the family income is no longer available, bringing with it substantial uncertainty. It is very likely as the wife herself had acknowledged, that their continued stay in Singapore is contingent on her finding suitable work. The wife is 50 years of age and regardless of her skills, her ability to obtain employment at the salary level the family was used to, is unlikely. Providing a buffer to the wife who has the care and control of the children was felt to be needed hence an adjustment was made. Given the relatively modest net value of assets, a 3.5% adjustment was made (which translates to a real value of about $37 000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The husband’s remuneration package – a lack of full and frank disclosure</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The wife asserted that “<em>No one at [Company X] works for the cash they are paid</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>As part of his company’s compensation structure, employees at Company X, earn shares as restricted stock units (RSU). 25% of the shares could be encashed after 1 year of being granted and 75% was similarly cashable every quarter or bi-annually over 4 years after it is granted. Shares were also granted through an employee salary sacrifice scheme (ESPP) and other equity-based instruments. It was the wife’s position that the husband dissipated and concealed his share portfolio and associated cash proceeds from the sale of shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While initially the husband appeared to be saying that rewards for personal work was not a matrimonial asset, submissions by his counsel accepted that vested shares and shares granted but unvested as at the time of the IJ should be retained in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided. With regards to the vested shares, he provided statements from an E-trade Morgan Stanley Account, the account through which shares are traded, to show its value as at April 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and highlighted also that he had given a sum of $43 000 to his wife, which he said represented half of the amount he received from the sale of vested shares.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Dissatisfied, the wife applied for discovery. One of the orders related to the need to produce documents to state the number of shares he owns whether provided by his company or purchased between April 2022 and March 2023. The judge who heard the application also noted that apart from the shares granted as part of the remuneration package, there was a need to disclose information on the additional shares purchased through the salary sacrifice scheme for the same period. In his affidavit attempting to comply with the orders, the husband produced instead the E-Trade Morgan Stanley accounts from 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> He said<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> “<em>Although the plaintiff requested for information/documents from April 2022, the disclosure sought for by the plaintiff is too extensive and onerous upon me. Further, I fail to see how the old statements would be relevant. I have therefore disclosed the information only from April 2023 onwards (i.e. the period when I moved out) and verily believe such extent disclosure</em> (sic) <em>is sufficient for the court to adequately determine my financial resources”.</em> This was a position unilaterally taken despite the court order. This threw up many questions with respect to the period before he left the matrimonial home and how those shares were dealt with, including the nature of expenditure from the shares if sold. With respect to the ESPP, a sum of $1 947 is deducted from his salary every month for its purchase. Information was not forthcoming on the number of shares he had between April 2022 and March 2023, disabling any submission on the prudence of how the sale proceeds, if any, was applied. Even for the period March 2023 to April 2024, he failed to identify the ESPP in the statements exhibited in his compliance affidavit. In his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit for the ancillary matters,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> he claimed that the E-Trade Morgan Stanley Statements provides details of it while saying at the same time that he sold the shares as soon as he purchased them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> He made no attempt to show the number of shares he held under the ESPP and how the figures aligned with his position that he utilised the proceeds for credit card loans immediately upon sale. Parties indeed “…<em>bear a duty to approach the division process with candour, diligence and a genuine commitment to resolution</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> An inference was made that the husband failed to fully account for the number of shares he had, in particular that which he purchased through deductions from his salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Adverse inferences should only be drawn if “<em>there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn and that person had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> There are 2 approaches that will allow an adverse inference arising out of non-disclosure to be effected. One would be for a court to make a finding on the estimated value of undisclosed assets and include that value in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided. This however would be effective typically, if there is available evidence. It can however be utilised even in the absence of it as seen in <em>BPC</em>. The other approach would be for the court to order a higher proportion of the assets to the other party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The lack of candour with respect to the true extent of his shares between April 2022 and April 2024 and if they were sold, where that value was deposited and how it was applied required in my view an uplift of 5% to be ascribed to the wife’s share.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Looking at the facts in totality and bearing in mind the continued relevance of the broad-brush approach, the following were the ratios for direct and indirect contributions, adjustments made to the average ratio and the 5% uplift for failure on the part of the husband to disclose his share portfolio fully in compliance with orders made pursuant to the discovery application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 3</b>: Final Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <table

reflects a balance between the means of the party paying and the needs of those receiving. S 68 of the Charter makes it clear that the duty to maintain children is placed on both parents. S 127 of the Charter provides for an order of maintenance to be made where a couple divorces or is in the process of doing so. The provisions within Parts 8 and 9 of the Charter apply. Insofar as the maintenance of former wives are concerned, the power to make an order is found in s 113 of the Charter. S 114 goes on to spell out various factors that may be taken into consideration in the determination of what may be reasonable. An important factor would be the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseable future, the ages of parties, the standard of living enjoyed by the family prior to the breakdown of the marriage and the responsiblilies and needs each party has or is likely to have in the forseable future.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given that the wife was no longer drawing an income from January 2025, the husband’s responsibilities became significantly larger. I was mindful that the lack of contribution by the wife at this time should not translate to the husband then providing for the same lifestyle the children were accustomed to as this would cripple him financially. I understand that with divorce and the creation of a new norm including setting up 2 households, has signficant impact on the financial situation of families. Clearly adjustments would have to be made. However, it did mean that for this time and until such time the wife finds suitable employment or if the children are compelled to relocate given that the wife’s residency in Singapore is linked to her employment here, the husband had to stretch his dollar to meet the needs of the family.

husband’s income as declared in his affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> is $19 474.67. He declared his net monthly income to be between $17 000 to $18 000 as almost S$2 000 would be deducted for the ESPP scheme<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> and contributions to his SRS. From a quick glance of the expenses of both parties, it is clear that even with the wife working, they were not able to meet expenses. With the wife not working, they need to relook their living expenses and school expenses of the children which are taking up the bulk of the available income. In <b><em>VBR</em></b> v <b><em>VBS</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> the court was of the view that a reasonable parent who is paying maintenance should live within his means and not take on unnecessary financial obligations which would reduce his ability to provide. The husband says that he had taken on accomodation at a relatively high rent of $6 000 per month to allow the children more space during access. While his wife denies having suggested this need, this is an expense that could be reduced if it is causing an inability to meet other expenses including maintenance. To be clear, I did not think that he was intentionally taking on such an expense to reduce his obligations. Insofar as school expenses are concerned which is taking up a substantial amount, it was a joint decision that the children be placed in an international school in Singapore. It would not be possible to place them in local schools at this time, even if the option were available. The reality is that they need to be kept in school until such time the wife obtains employment which will then allow her to resume her responsibility to maintain the children with their father. In <b><em>XPG</em></b> v <b><em>XPH</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> the court similarly found it to be in the best interests of the child to continue his education at an international school, having already completed 1.5 years there. The court opined that any disruption to the current school arrangement may adversely affect the child’s academic progress and emotional well-being. In the case before me, the order enabling the husband to deal directly with the school was to allow for some flexibitlity in the short-term, (i.e., pending greater certainty in the wife’s professional life), in drawing up a payment plan. This is of course subject to the school’s agreement. The payment of school fees is not realistically to come from his net salary every month and would need to be drawn from his assets, bonuses and share returns. Documents showing his past annual income is able to meet this if he manages it carefully. Given that the elder child will be sitting for the international GCSE soon, it would be vital that this period of time pass without interruption. Additionally, the school the children are at provide support for students with ADHD.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Conversations as to the long term plans for schooling however would inevitably need to take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The order of monthly maintenance of $4 000 per child ($8 000 per month in total) was ordered on a computation of reasonable expenses as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 4</b>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"61.44%\"><col width=\"38.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Accomodation (2/3 of rent of $6 600)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4 400 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">All extra activities (basketball, rock climbing etc) and payments for mobile phones etc currently paid for by the father to be subsumed within the maintenance order</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Approximately $1 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Food (including meals outside)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Approximtely $2 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Clothing/Shoes/Nutritional Supplements/haircuts/books/toiletries/medical and dental not covered by insurance</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$700</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Transportation</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total:</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$8 600</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Even if only the most basic of expenses are taken into account, the figure stands at $8 600. I did not take into account many other items which the children were used to having. I also did not include expenditure that a parent with care and control would in any case incur even if she did not have care and control.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>The maintenance amount would also need to be utilised to pay for services which the husband is currently paying for. Insofar as medical and dental expenses are concerned, insurance coverage can be activated when needed. For all medical expenses which are not so covered, the maintenance amount would need to be used to meet those. Therefore if the children are to consult a general practitioner and the cost is not covered by insurance, this is to be paid from the maintenance amount. The only exception when the maintenance amount need not be used for medical expenses (which are not covered by insurance) is in the event of hospitalisation as the charges are likely to be high.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I allowed a sum of $1 000 per month as maintenance for the ex-wife for a period of 2 years or until she secures employment, whichever is earlier, so as to provide some assistance with rent and food at this time. I am in agreement with the husband that she had always been financially independent and that they had jointly contributed resources for the maintenance of the family. She did not in the past depend on the provision of spousal maintenance which would typically be of some relevance in deciding if she should be entitled to any, post-divorce. I was of the view however that some support for a limited period against the backdrop of a rather more affluent lifestyle in the past, would be fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     With the unfortunate termination of the wife’s employment, a significant source of family income was no longer available, making it important to determine the division of matrimonial assets with the larger interests of the children in mind. This is so especially because parties do not own property and the net value of assets is relatively modest. The maintenance obligation on the husband is not a light one but it is likely to be temporary. The maintenance orders are, in my view, necessary given the need to provide stability to the children both in terms of their living arrangements and their education. The husband would need, as would the wife and children, make rather dramatic changes to lifestyle to meet their long term needs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 19 of wife’s affidavit of 20/11/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 75 of husband’s affidavit of 23/5/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Page 11 at paragraph (e) of the husband’s affidavit of 8/11/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Summons 254/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>At paragraph 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup><b><em>XRM</em></b> v <b><em>XXR</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33835-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 55</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 64 of wife’s submissions dated 20/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of husband’s affidavit of 23/5/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 65 of wife’s submissions dated 20/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Annex C of husband’s submissions dated 18/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Page 16A of NE dated 22/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18603-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 13</a>.

id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are the grounds of my decision on the ancillary matters in FC/D 1867/2023, and on FC/SUM 3674/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This matter involves a plaintiff wife (“W”) and defendant husband (“H”), who have a son (“S”) who turns 5 years old this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       This claim was filed in April 2023. Interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on an uncontested basis on both claim and counterclaim in December 2023, and the ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing was fixed for its first hearing in January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Pursuant to a consent order in October 2024, both parties have resolved the issue of division of assets and spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As for the children’s issues, W had applied in July 2023 (in FC/SUM 2184/2023) for interim joint custody, sole care and control (“C&amp;C”) with access to H, permission to move out of the matrimonial home. H in September 2023 then applied (in FC/SUM 2755/2023) to have joint custody of S, (sole) interim C&amp;C with access to W. The Court therefore ordered joint custody of S. In September 2023, the Court ordered that, pending the disposal of the applications, W would have interim C&amp;C of S from Sunday 10am to Thursday sending him to school; and H would have C&amp;C of S from Thursday after school to Sunday 10am (“the interim interim orders”). In December 2023, the Court ordered interim shared C&amp;C of S, broadly in the same terms as the interim interim orders. The orders were that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    Pending the resolution of the ancillary matters,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    [W] and [H] shall have interim joint custody of [S]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   [W] shall have interim care and control of [S] from Sunday 10am to Thursday sending him to school; and [H] shall have care and control of [S] from Thursday after school to Sunday 10am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   Neither party is to show up at [S]’s school during the other party’s interim care and control time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   During each party’s care and control time with [S], the other party may have reasonable phone/video access of up to 15 minutes a day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    Parties are to have access to [S] on alternate public holidays and school-declared holidays, starting with Christmas Day 2023 which will be spent with [H].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(vi)   The order dated 7 Sept 2023 that neither party is to take any audio or video recordings or to take photographs of the other party with or without [S] is to stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Each party is to bear their own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       What remains for my decision is the issue of S’s care and control (and access), and maintenance. Fixed along with the AM hearing was H’s summons for an injunction to restrain W from changing S’s current preschool arrangement pending the resolution of the AMs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 3674/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This application, it appears, was founded on the concern that W had made inquiries and taken some preparatory steps to withdraw S from his current preschool, which is near the matrimonial home where S resides with H from Thursday after school to Sunday, and to enrol him in another preschool, which is nearer W’s current residence. The filing of the application on 5 December 2024, was, according to counsel, motivated by the fact that W did not reply to H’s letter on Sunday, 1 December 2024 seeking confirmation by Wednesday, 4 December 2024 as to W’s intended course of action.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the case conference, W confirmed that S would not be transferred until the AMs were resolved. This rendered the substantive prayers in SUM 3674/2024 moot, leaving the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I made no order as to the costs of this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Even if I agreed with W that the particular choice of a preschool is a decision properly of C&amp;C rather than custody (on the authority of the learned district judge in <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a>, whose decision was upheld by the High Court), this would not necessarily have entitled W to unilaterally switch S’s preschool, because C&amp;C in this case—unlike in <em>WUG v WUH</em>—was shared. It therefore stands to reason that H ought to be part of the decision to switch preschools.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     More to the point, H’s argument was that there was urgency to the application because he had discovered in the last week of November 2024 that W was intending to withdraw S from the preschool. Although the preschool teacher had scheduled a meeting with both parents on 5 November 2024, H says that he did not receive a response to his letter, and he did not wish to attend the meeting only to be informed that the change in school was confirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, I am not persuaded that there was an urgency in the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, it was already made known in W’s affidavit, filed on 7 September 2024, that W had found another childcare centre and secured a vacancy for Kindergarten 1 intake in January 2025, and intended to switch preschools in December 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> H’s supposed discovery in November 2024 that W was preparing to go ahead with the change of preschool in December 2024 therefore should not come as a surprise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, H had already made known to S’s preschool on 29 November 2024 (through the messaging function on the preschool’s mobile application) that he had joint custody and shared C&amp;C over S, and that he wished to be informed if W requested to withdraw S from the preschool. W then interjected to say that she would inform H when she makes the request, and that she “[would] confirm next week” (<em>ie</em>, the week of 2 December 2024). This alone might not have fully quelled H’s concern that the withdrawal might be crystallised by the time he was made aware of it, but the teacher in response informed H and W that the director wished to meet both parents on 5 December at 1pm. In my view, this ought to have been treated as an indication that matters were fluid rather than finalised; it would in my judgment have been unusual for the director to call a meeting if it were only to inform H of an irrevocable withdrawal from the preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the above reasons, I make no order on the application, and no order on costs of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">AMs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the outset of my decision on the AMs, I record my disappointment and disapproval of the parties on two matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Parties were essentially reprimanded in the District Judge’s judgment on interim C&amp;C in December 2023 for filing affidavits in excess of a hundred pages each, rehashing grievances with each other in detail. That hardly changed in the next three rounds of affidavits filed for the AMs; the text of the parties’ affidavits alone totalled over 360 pages; this was very nearly the same length as the text of the affidavits in the first three rounds of affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Additionally, even though the District Judge had tried to impress on both parties that the need to spend quality time with S ought to trump the need to outshine the other parent, both parties continued to use the language of a “primary caregiver”. From my reading of the affidavits, it appears to me that both parties played important roles in bringing S up. Neither parent has been anywhere near perfect, and neither could have done it without the other. It would be unfair to call either parent the primary caregiver to the exclusion of the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There is no dispute that custody is to be joint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">C&amp;C</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Each parent sought sole C&amp;C of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The parents’ prayers for sole C&amp;C is understandable, considering that W takes the view that shared C&amp;C is not working out as ideally as was hoped, and that S will start formal primary school education in 2027. It has been recognised that a shared C&amp;C arrangement may not be practical once a child commences formal education (<em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [107]). Among other concerns, it would be impractical to require S to keep duplicate sets of school materials, or to require S to have to carry extra materials from one residence to the other so that he can keep up with a shared C&amp;C arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     There is, of course, no dispute that the appropriate order depends on what is in the best interest of S. The non-exhaustive factors to be considered include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my judgment, the considerations in this case were rather finely balanced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Bond with S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In cases involving young children, the Court generally favours awarding C&amp;C to the mother. The factors in this case generally tend to reinforce rather than displace this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     H argues that S shares a close bond with him, on the basis of several messages from W to H expressing various levels of disappointment or frustration that S was trying to look for H rather than W, or that S was uncooperative with W because S wanted to be with H. I do not make very much of these arguments, because, generally speaking, the most recent of such messages date back to 2022. This pre-dates even the divorce proceedings by nearly a year. Between the last of such messages and now, the dynamics of S’s relationships with H and W could have—and, in fact, would have, in view of the interim C&amp;C order—changed a lot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     To be clear, I do not regard W as attempting to repair her relationship with S at the eleventh hour for the purpose of “winning H at the C&amp;C battle”. The fact that W has been expressing this kind of disappointment and frustration suggests to me that W exhibits cares about her relationship with S, and desires for it to improve.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Maintenance of status quo</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Presently, there is shared C&amp;C with 4 weekdays to W and essentially 1 weekday and the weekends to H.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I acknowledge the principle that preserving the status quo for stability is in the welfare of the child (<em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>). It is true that the status quo has essentially arisen from the interim C&amp;C order (as opposed to having arisen organically). Nonetheless, I do not think that this precludes the court from considering that one desideratum of this exercise is the maintenance of status quo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The more pressing problem is that, short of ordering shared C&amp;C—which neither party seriously disputes is not functioning well in their case—the status quo will be upset, since it would appear that the remaining options are sole C&amp;C to one of the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the circumstances, the eventual arrangement which in my judgment best preserves (or at least approximates) the status quo, on the premise that sole C&amp;C is given to one parent, would be to allow W to have C&amp;C with reasonable access to H (as opposed to leaving C&amp;C with H with reasonable access to W).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, in my judgment, W is the parent exercising more rigour and discipline over routine (I elaborate more on this later). This discipline and routine will in my view be increasingly important as S prepares to enter formal education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, W is the parent who has had the clear bulk of the weekdays with S in this interim period. Undoubtedly, she would have had a larger hand in shaping S’s daily routines where the routine matters most, and she would also have the experience in managing S’s routine. It would seem to me less disruptive to S (and therefore be in S’s best interests) to allow W to have C&amp;C of S and manage S’s weekday routines, than to allow H to have C&amp;C of S. Considering that the relationship between W and H is especially acrimonious, and W and H have clearly different parenting styles, awarding C&amp;C to S would mean a reversal of schooling routines with which S would have been accustomed. I consider that this would be distressing for S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parents’ capacity to provide for S’s needs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In general, it is apparent that both parents’ parenting styles differ significantly. W has come across as the more organised parent, and the routine-setter and the disciplinarian. W has, in her affidavit, has set out the routines which she observes or intends for S. I find these to be generally sensible. H, on the other hand, comes across as the more laissez-faire parent, and more willing to depart from routine. In my view, as time wears on, S will need to observe an increasingly rigorous and structured schedule, as he emerges from kindergarten and enters formal primary school education. In the circumstances, it seems to me to be in S’s best interests to have W, as the more regimental parent, to manage S’s day-to-day care on the weekdays generally, and H to enjoy time with H on the weekends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Even if I give allowance for the fact that W, having interim C&amp;C for the most part of the weekdays, would be in a better position than H to describe S’s routine, I do not think that entirely accounts for the fact that H’s proposals for access (flowing from his submission that he receive sole C&amp;C) are, as W submits, less feasible in comparison. H had proposed that he have C&amp;C of S from Tuesday after school to Sunday 11am, while W has access from Sunday 11am to Tuesday sending him to school. This appears to give H the benefit of more time with S, but it retains the difficulties that shared C&amp;C entails, in terms of handing-over during school days. In my judgment, this arrangement is not in the interest of W insofar as preserving the bond between W and S is concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In terms of meals, I also note that W is in a better position to make home-cooked meals for S. H, despite working from home, relies on meal delivery services. In my view, this factor favours W slightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In terms of the time and attention that each parent has for S, the considerations are finely balanced. It appears to me that W has a more demanding daily schedule and may come home from work later on some days. H is able to work from home, but the benefits that he gains from that are somewhat negated by the fact that he has to travel overseas on occasion for work and will have to enlist the help of extended family. H’s work arrangement may be coordinated well with a shared C&amp;C arrangement, but it will come under strain if H has sole C&amp;C. Although there is nothing wrong <em>per se</em> with enlisting the help of family members for child-minding, the parent’s personal involvement would be slightly more beneficial to the child insofar as supervising homework is concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Acrimony and gatekeeping</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     H makes several arguments that W is the less appropriate C&amp;C parent, because of various instances of gatekeeping, inflammatory, and litigation-oriented conduct. These allegations include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     W seeking to unilaterally withdraw S from his current preschool and enrol him in another;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     W being uncooperative during video-call access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     W expressing her animosity towards H by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Calling H a monster in front of S;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Rebuffing H with harsh messages;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     W ceasing her attendance at counselling; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     W subjecting S to photo-taking for the purpose of amassing photographic evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     On the whole, I was not entirely impressed by H’s factual allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     It is true that W’s conduct has not been exemplary. For example, there was no need for W to insist that H is a monster, or to say that the matrimonial home is a scary place. There was no need to castigate H for season’s greetings or pleasantries, as W has done on some occasions. However, these appear to be better characterised as occasional outbursts at H, rather than a ceaseless campaign of vilifying H. It is somewhat ironic that H has now capitalised on these to argue that W is the source of the acrimony, when H’s detailed, almost blow-by-blow account of W’s conduct—which I found to be characterised in a critical manner—would itself have contributed to the acrimony. If H’s affidavit and submissions are any guide, H is relatively likely to influence S’s views of W, just as W is likely to influence S’s views of H.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     H has also argued that W has subjected S to a barrage of photo-taking. For example, H says that, when S had a runny nose, W would take a photo of S with his mucus running down to his chin, rather than wipe him up. However, these photographs were contemporaneously sent to H to keep him apprised of S’s condition, rather than preserved as evidence to be presented in Court for the first time. Again, it seems somewhat ironic that these photographs surfaced in H’s affidavit (to argue that W was gathering evidence) rather than W’s affidavit (to argue that H did not take sufficient care of S’s health).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I am also not prepared to say that the steps taken by W to withdraw S from his current preschool is a clear instance of gatekeeping conduct. W has offered a perfectly reasonable and plausible explanation for wanting to change S’s preschool. It is true that W has passed comments that gives the impression that she does not quite welcome H’s involvement in the decision on whether to change S’s preschool, but it is also true that W has held her hands pending the outcome of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As for video-call access, I am not overly troubled if video-call access has not been progressing smoothly, as I am satisfied that the final orders for physical access will suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On the whole, I do not consider that there is any gatekeeping, inflammatory, and litigation-oriented conduct of sufficient severity that leads me to think that W will interfere with H’s access to S, or materially compromise H’s relationship with S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Personal idiosyncrasies</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn to consider the personal idiosyncrasies of H and W, which I consider favour W slightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It appears to me that W is less inhibited in her outbursts and use of intemperate language or behaviour around S. However, this appears to be improving. Although H has listed a number of examples in which W was intemperate, they appear to be decreasing slightly in frequency as time goes on, and more importantly, they appear to be increasingly directed at H (<em>ie</em>, away from S). Although H pointed out that W defaulted on court-ordered counselling sessions, W clarified that while she stopped attending the <em>joint</em> counselling sessions as she found it unproductive, she continued with <em>personal</em> counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     A factor that weighs slightly in favour of sole C&amp;C to W is that H has, over the course of divorce proceedings, picked up smoking. This is, in contrast to W’s conduct, a downward trajectory in my view. H’s counsel has said that H smokes only when the child is not around, and he was sure that H would be willing to give an undertaking that H will not smoke going forward. However, on the record, all that H has said—and he has had the opportunity to do so—was that he would not “expose [S] to such smoke”. Unless H kicks the habit completely, S will still be exposed to second-hand smoke, which is deleterious to S’s health. In my view, this slightly tilts the balance in favour of awarding C&amp;C to W.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Taking the above considerations into account—in particular each parent’s capacity and ability to provide for S’s needs and to observe routines with S, I consider that S would be slightly better off under circumstances where C&amp;C is awarded to W. Accordingly, I consider it in the best interests of S for W to have C&amp;C of him, and order accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It follows from the above that H is to have reasonable access to S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     H sought highly detailed access orders. I am generally not in favour of making detailed access orders, but in this case I will go into some detail, considering that the acrimony between parties is such that a broadly-worded order is far too likely to result in further disagreements between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     That said, I was not inclined to make orders along the lines of what H sought. H, for example, sought to divide each long school holiday exactly into half, and to divide Chinese New Year (“CNY”) into a series of trade-offs where each parent would take turns to have access to S for the entire of the first day of CNY in one year, and in the other for the eve of CNY and the second day of CNY. In my view, this is undesirable considering that S will have to undergo up to four handovers in three days, and it appears to stem from H’s deep-seated aim to split access right down the middle—again, something which the learned DJ tried to persuade parties against desiring in her judgment on the interim orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Location of the handover</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Parties also disagreed as to the location of the handover. H wished for the handover to be at the lobby of his residence, while W wished for the handover to be at a “neutral” public place. However, I do not consider Paya Lebar MRT station to be as neutral as W makes it out to be, considering that it is far nearer to W’s residence than it is to H’s residence. In the circumstances, I consider it fairer for each parent to be picking S up from the other parent’s residence (or from school, if S is schooling).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Terms of access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In my view, if school holidays or public holidays fall within a long school holiday period (<em>e.g.</em>, Christmas falling within the December holiday period), it would not make very much sense to exchange access for a single day. This, it seems to me, is disruptive to S’s schedule. The exception is Chinese New Year, being the culturally significant holiday that parties wished to have a specific provision for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Parties had also sought a clarification on the judgment of the learned DJ who gave the interim orders in relation to holidays longer than a day. In my view, the DJ’s premises and conclusions were clear, and there was in my view no ambiguity that required a clarification with the DJ who issued the order. As the DJ said, longer holidays need not be split exactly down the middle, because it is impractical, because moving between homes every day is disruptive, and because it simply furthers the parties’ calculative behaviour. For these reasons, with which I agree, where there are consecutive days which are either gazetted a public holiday or declared a school holiday, I will treat them as a single holiday. I expect that, in the long run, any inequality in the amount of holiday time that S will get to spend with each parent will even out</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Barring any agreement which the parties might reach, I will order that access be on the following terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     H is to have access to S every Friday (after school, or if S is not attending school on Friday, at 10.30am), to Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Long school holidays</b>.

However, it remains part of each parent’s duty to facilitate and not to disrupt S’s communications with the other parent, should S wish to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     W, on the basis that she has C&amp;C of S, sought reasonable maintenance of S to be paid by D, until S either turns 21 years of age or obtains his first university degree, whichever is later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Proportion of contribution</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     W, in her submissions, estimates S’s monthly expenses at $2,383.50. W says that, on the basis that the monthly salaries of W and H are about $15,000.00 and $13,000.00 per month, respectively, H should be responsible for 46.4% of S’s monthly expenses, which would be $1,105.94 per month. H disputes his means, and claims that his annual income, for the purpose of Year of Assessment 2024, is $126,306, and that therefore he should contribute only 35% to the maintenance of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Although H’s notice of assessment is not in evidence, I accept that his income for calendar year 2023 is approximately $126,306, on the basis of the year-to-date salary figure on his December 2023 payslip.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> As for W’s income, given that her employment commenced in February 2024, it is understandable that she did not submit a notice of assessment. Her employment contract indicated that, apart from 15 months’ guaranteed salary plus bonus (at $12,000 per month), she would be entitled to 5% of the treatment value of medical fees which she charges, and 10% of the product value of herbal medicines prescribed, plus bonuses at the discretion of the company. In all likelihood, this would put her income slightly in excess of the round figure of $180,000 that she submitted in Court. Had W’s salary been a flat sum of $180,000, then H ought to contribute about 41.2% towards the maintenance of S, assuming that each party contributes in proportion to his or her income relative to their aggregate income. Given that W’s salary is likely to be higher, but approaching this conservatively, I would notionally order that H contribute a round proportion of 40% towards the maintenance of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Line items</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Essentially, both parties accept a budget of $100.00 per month on clothes, and $1,008.00 per month on preschool fees. I turn to the individual line items which were disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In terms of eating out, H takes issue with W’s estimate of $200.00 per month on the basis that W, by her own claim, makes home-cooked food for S at least 3 of the 4 nights that he is with her, and that they will go to her parents’ place twice a week for dinner. H says that a figure of $100.00 is fair. On the other hand, as W points out, H has budgeted $1,000.00 per month on his own eating out (although this includes buying food for parents). In this light, $100.00 appears to me to be unnecessarily restrictive. Considering the frequency with which W plans to eat at home, and her planned expenditure on groceries, I will allocate a budget of $150.00 for eating out, being the midpoint of W’s and H’s estimates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In terms of transport costs, I agree with W’s estimate of $200.00 per month, considering that W sends S to preschool by private hire 16 times per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In terms of medical costs, I will accept H’s estimate of $100.00 per month. Although W submitted that medical and dental costs for children are slightly higher when they fall sick, there appears to be nothing in the record that supports this proposition. In fact, it might be thought that children’s medical and dental fees are lower considering that they are more heavily subsidised. In this light, W’s estimate of $300.00 per month—or $3,600.00 per year—is in my judgment excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In terms of toys, I accept H’s estimate of $50.00 per month. In my view, the point is not so much whether H or W is characterised as the “fun parent”. $50.00 a month means $600.00 a year, and in my judgment, that is an adequate amount to be spending on toys. Likewise, I would consider W’s estimate of $200.00 per month—or $2,400.00 per year— to be excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In terms of diapers and milk powder, I accept H’s estimate of $40.00 per month. As H points out, P’s own evidence is that S is essentially toilet-trained, and generally is not allowed diapers anymore. Going forward, S is starting Kindergarten 2 in a few months, and his expenses in this regard will decrease in the coming months. I leave the $40.00 there as S will incur more of other costs (<em>eg</em>, the expenses for S’s food will increase as he grows).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In terms of household expenses, H disputed W’s claim of $275.50 as S’s share of household expenses, and was prepared to concede only $100.00 per month. The household expenses, in this regard, would include groceries, utilities and phone charges. In my view, $275.50 is not an unreasonable sum to represent S’s share of household expenses in a two-person household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Based on the above, the total expenses for S would be $1,923.50 per month. At 40%, it would be $769.40. In the circumstances, I order that H pay W a monthly maintenance of a round sum of $770.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     To avoid doubt, this sum takes into account S’s preschool fees at $1,008.00. In the event that S changes preschools, or when S enrols into primary school, maintenance may be varied accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Duration of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I decline to order maintenance to be paid until S obtains his first university degree. S is currently five years old, and it is speculative whether he can or will eventually enter university. In the event that he does, nothing I say forecloses the possibility of bringing a further application either to very child maintenance or for fresh maintenance in favour of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In summary, my orders are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><u>SUM 3674/2024</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    No order on the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    No order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><u>D 1867/2023</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Care and control</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    The plaintiff is to have care and control of the child of the marriage (“S”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Access</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    The defendant is to have access to S every Friday (after school, or if S is not attending school on Friday, at 10.30am), to Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Long school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    For school holidays which are at least 1 week in duration, parties shall have access to S on alternate weeks.

In SSP 623/2025, she applied for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) against the Father for herself and the older child of the marriage (&quot;C&quot;), along with a Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO) limited to the master bedroom and C's bedroom. In SSP 722/2025, she applied for additional orders, specifically a stay away order of five metres around the matrimonial home, no contact orders for herself and C, and counselling orders for the Father. The Mother was represented by counsel while the Father appeared in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After hearing both parties, I dismissed the Mother’s PPO applications for both C and the Mother. Dissatisfied, the Mother appealed against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The family</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The family comprised of the Father, Mother, and two children, with a live-in domestic helper (V). At the time of the incidents, C was 14 years old and the second child was 11. There were no applications for the second child and the Father. Concurrently, the parties were undergoing divorce proceedings. At the time of the PPO trial, Interim Judgment had been granted on an uncontested basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Claims </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence against herself and C through a sustained pattern of emotional and psychological abuse. No physical violence was alleged. The Father vehemently denied these allegations and maintained that no family violence had occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A list of the parties’ affidavits and evidence is found in <u>Annex A</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The issues </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The central issue is the interpretation of &quot;emotional and psychological abuse&quot; within Part 7 of the Women’s Charter (the “Charter”) which sets out the law on protection against family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 58B(1) of the Charter defines &quot;family violence&quot; to include &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot;. Section 58B(4) defines &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot; as &quot;conduct or behaviour that torments, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person; or causes or may reasonably be expected to cause mental harm to a person.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Despite this statutory definition, determining what constitutes &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot; remains subjective and open to various interpretation. Given the broad definition, an overly liberal interpretation of Section 58B(4) may lead to outcomes inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The illustrations in Section 58B and parliamentary readings provide crucial insights into the conduct the law seeks to address. During the Second Reading of the Bill<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, the Minister of State highlighted examples of emotional or psychological abuse which included</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     a perpetrator threatening to withhold monthly allowances,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     a perpetrator constantly monitoring the victim's whereabouts,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     a perpetrator isolating the victim from friends and family,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     a perpetrator preventing the victim from leaving the house, and threatening the victim with negative consequences to compel the victim’s compliance,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     a perpetrator threatening to evict the victim without financial or physical resources and refusing to renew the victim’s long-term visit pass,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     a perpetrator creating fear in the victim of eviction and separation from children, which prevents victims from seeking protection<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The common thread in these examples and illustrations is the perpetrator's controlling behaviour over the victim through fear (whether for personal safety or likely consequences), resulting in mental or emotional harm to the victim. Such behaviour is referred to as &quot;coercive control&quot; in the Second Reading.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Therefore, despite the expansive definition in Section 58B, not every action causing distress will constitute emotional abuse. Significantly, the statute uses &quot;emotional abuse&quot; rather than &quot;emotional distress&quot;, suggesting the victim must suffer some level of emotional harm beyond mere unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ultimately, the purpose of a PPO is to protect victims from harmful behaviour by establishing clear boundaries of conduct that a reasonable person would consider unacceptable. A PPO is not intended to punish the aggressor or pass judgment on their social interactions or parenting style. A finding of family violence has serious ramifications for the relationship between the aggressor and the victim and could accelerate the breakdown of familial ties. While the Court will not hesitate to grant PPOs in deserving cases, we should be cautious about granting applications where the facts fall short of demonstrating emotional or psychological harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Returning to the facts of this case, the issues to be determined were: (a) whether the alleged acts, if committed, constituted emotional or psychological abuse against the Mother or C; and (b) assuming the answer to (a) was in the affirmative, whether a protection order was necessary for their protection or safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Family violence committed against C</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother contended that the Father engaged in a sustained pattern of emotional and psychological abuse towards C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother relied on four key incidents on 29 January 2025, 6 February 2025, 24 March 2025, and 15 April 2025 and 3 relatively minor incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. C was not called as a witness. The Mother was also not an eyewitness to these incidents and relied solely on CCTV footage. Given the inherent limitations of CCTV evidence, there was limited video evidence for most incidents, with examination heavily dependent on audio recordings, which were themselves incomplete.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Before turning to the evidence, I addressed the Mother’s argument that the Father had breached the Browne v Dunn<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> rule in that he did not cross examine the Mother on C’s emotional state during the incidents. As a result, it was the Mother’s position that the Father did not challenge the fact that C was distressed by the Father’s actions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The rule of Browne v Dunn was explained in the case of Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> in this manner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“… where a submission was going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness, which was of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it had not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I found that the Father had not breached the Browne v Dunn rule in relation to the incidents involving C. C was not called as a witness and was not cross-examined. Therefore, the Father could not have put his case to C regarding her emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I would now deal with the evidence in the key incidents. The timestamps for the key incidents were included in the analysis below for easy reference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">29/1/25 incident “Pink lead” incident<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother alleged that the Father was violent in the following manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Told C to “stop being violent” [Timestamp: 14:18:23], which suggested that the Father would take the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s side against C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Told C that he could wield his power presumably to hit.

[14:29:50, 14:30:00, 02]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Told C to “shut up” multiple times. [14:30:32]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Told C to “learn [her] limits and [stay] in [her] limits”. [14:30:32]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Reminded C that “[she] is still in [the Father’s] house”. [14:30:43]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The M claimed that these actions distressed C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father disagreed that he was aggressive and pointed out that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident happened in the context of an argument between C and 2<sup>nd</sup> child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     His statements in 14:21:40 and 14:22:12 were misconstrued. At the material time, C had pulled the 2<sup>nd</sup> child. He (the Father) was trying to keep the children apart and told the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to move back. He had said that hitting was not allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     C herself was verbally abusive by using inappropriate words. [14:18:57]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother did not provide the complete video footage of the incident, particularly: (i) the video was muted and there was a gap in the footage between 14:22:12 – 14:25:8 (ii) the Mother had other footages which would show what happened immediately before the Father stepped into the fray.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     At the onset, it was necessary to highlight that the evidence for this incident contained only audio recordings without video footages. The Mother did not seem to dispute that the incident occurred during an argument between the children and that the Father intervened to de-escalate the dispute. However, the Mother took issue with the Father telling C to “stop being violent”. On the stand, when asked to explain why she found the Father’s actions aggressive, she said “he goes into the room and blames [C] … did not give her time to explain … he takes the side of the 2<sup>nd</sup> child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was clear from the exchange immediately after the Father’s statement “[C] first of all stop being violent” that the Father had entered when the argument between the children was already heated. The 2<sup>nd</sup> child suggested that C had thrown a book earlier [14:18:23]. The Father also asked C if she had pulled the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s hair earlier [14:18:53] which C did not seem to deny. It was reasonable to assume that the Father had overheard the argument before he intervened which explained his initial statement to C to “stop being violent” [14:18:23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother claimed that the Father had made a veiled threat that he would allow the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to hit C. She was of the view that the threat was implied when the Father said [at 14:21:40] “try that, try that, where are you learning this from, you know the last person who tried hitting me, after 7 times of forgiving them, I gave one and that calmed down the whole family. The whole family that had started to be violent with me. I gave just one. .. Power is not hitting, power is in the other person knowing that you can. The whole family had to touch my feet.” This was followed by [at 14:22:12] “… no [2<sup>nd</sup> child] can hit you. [2<sup>nd</sup> child’] doesn’t because he knows the moment he raised his hand I will be the first one …”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was of the view that the Mother had not proven on a balance of probability that the Father had threatened C indirectly. The statement in 14:21:40 was ambiguous and context-dependent. From the evidence, there was a gap of 2 minutes in the evidence prior to the Father making that statement. When the Father asked the Mother to provide the full evidence, the Mother did not explain why the complete evidence could not be provided. Without knowing what happened immediately prior to the Father’s statement, it was not possible to ascribe the meaning suggested by the Mother. As for the Father’s later statement in [14:22:12], I preferred the Father's interpretation, which was objectively consistent with his earlier statements. The Father had explained during cross-examination that he was, at the material time, trying to keep the children apart and had told the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to move away. He had intended to say &quot;although the second child can hit C, he doesn't because he knows the moment he raises his hand, I will be the first to stop him.&quot; Given the context, the meaning ascribed by the Father was not reasonable. The Mother had not proven on a balance of probability that the Father intended to threaten C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father’s other remarks, such as telling C to “shut up”, showed the Father’s increasing frustration. His lack of parental insight was also evident in his disregard of C’s expressed wishes to be left alone. However, none of statements even if considered collectively amounted to family violence. Throughout the exchange, C did not display signs of emotional or mental distress. For the most part, C put up a spirited defence. At times, she was even defiant and sarcastic in her retorts, eg when she suggested that “[2<sup>nd</sup> child] is so great.” While C was clearly unhappy and believed that the Father was biased, her reaction as a whole did not suggest that she was in anyway frightened or intimidated by the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">6/2/25 incident “Bedroom light” incident<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother made the following allegations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father called the C “vicious” and “shameless”. [22:51:40, 22:53:18]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father insinuated that C had picked up her vicious behaviour from the Mother. [22:51:48]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father attempted to exert control by claiming that it was his house. [22:51:17]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father eavesdropped on C’s subsequent phone conversation with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, the Father’s position was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident happened while he was trying to resolve the children’s argument and had lost his temper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He did not call C vicious. Instead it was a general observation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Similar to the 29/1/25 incident, both parties agreed that the 6/2/25 incident involved the Father intervening in the children’s argument. On the stand, the Mother explained that the Father “gets entrenched in the children’s argument and the argument starts escalating”, “positions himself on the side of [the second child]”. The Mother went on to say “It is clear from the narrative that [the Father] is on the [second child’s] team.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father’s conduct must be understood in the broader context of the ongoing argument between the children which concerned sleeping arrangements. C wanted to continue her activities in the room while the second child wanted to sleep in the same room. Neither child was prepared to give in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In relation to the Father’s use of the word “vicious”, the Father’s position was that he did not call C vicious but meant the statement to be a general observation. The Mother maintained on the stand that C understood the Father to be calling her vicious.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The exact statement with the exchange immediately prior to

In fact, when challenged by C, the Father also clarified [at 22:51:48] “No it is about manners”. I agreed that the Father’s statement was about his expectations of how children should behave and was intended to establish equal standards for both children's conduct, prohibiting hitting and vicious behaviour generally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I found that the Father had intended to refer to C when he said [at 22:51:18] &quot;you are becoming shameless&quot;. He had also used the fact that he owned the house [at 22:51:17] to imply that C should not continue to be difficult. However, the mention of “It is my room. This is my house. This is my house” in the context of a parent-child argument would not satisfy the concept of “coercive control”. Coercive control required both the aggressor's intention to wield control and the victim's lack of viable alternatives. Here, C retained options such as returning to her own room or using another available room in the house. Additionally, throughout the incident, C did not display any hint of emotional or mental dysregulation. At no point during the incident did she back down or withdraw. While it could not be denied that C was upset by the entire exchange, her conduct did not suggest that she had suffered emotional harm. Therefore, I found that the Father’s conduct did not cross the threshold into “emotional or mental abuse”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">24/3/25: Calling 911 incident<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and 15/4/25 incident: Letter to school counsellor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence against C by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Telling C to get out.

The Mother claimed that the 24/3/25 incident reflected a continuing and escalating pattern of the Father singling C out by threatening and intimidating C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the Father’s letter to school on 15/4/25, the Mother claimed that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     F’s counselling request was meant as punitive</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     F’s letter portrayed himself a victim of C’s behaviour</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As a result of the Father’s actions, C feels distressed and suffered from emotional harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father’s position on the stand and from cross-examining the Mother was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father was trying to contain the situation and manage the children during their argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father denied that he was referring to C when he said “lost the mental plot”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had not intended to say 911 (ie. call the police) but rather to refer C to counselling. He had also corrected himself within a reasonable time after he misspoke. [23:00:28]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father believed that C required counselling to address her behaviour and denied that he had used counselling as a threat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Similar to the incidents of 29/1/25 and 6/2/25, the 24/3/25 incident began with the Father attempting to contain the conflict between the children. Father's choice of words regarding C, such as &quot;you have always been one of those children&quot; and &quot;that's why you have become a problem in life,&quot; “convict blood” was thoughtless even if he had made those comments in the context of an escalating argument. I had also found that the Father had intended to refer to C when he said &quot;somebody has lost their mental plot.&quot; Nonetheless, as with the earlier incidents, C remained spirited throughout. Her retorts were sharp in response to the Father and to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child. She openly challenged the Father when she disagreed with his remarks. She did not shy away from the argument and in fact returned to the same room despite the Father’s presence. She displayed no signs of emotional distress beyond the expected unhappiness arising from the underlying argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Regarding Father's alleged 'threat' to call 911, there was no direct evidence as to how the ‘threat’ was supposedly made. However, Mother's own transcript showed the Father clarifying his intention to refer C to counselling rather than call 911 [at 22:55:45 – 22:56:16, 23:00:28]. The Mother argued that despite Father's subsequent clarification, C had perceived the threat at the time and was distressed and fearful that Father might evict her from the house. In other words, the damage was already done. However, C's subsequent actions contradicted Mother's position. If C genuinely feared Father would act on his threat, it was unlikely that she would have openly challenged him about his “threat”. Indeed, C herself mentioned Father's 'threat' in response to his claim that he would always love her. C's behaviour was inconsistent with that of a child who was fearful or distraught. In any event, I agreed that the Father had corrected C's misunderstanding within a reasonable timeframe, which should have assuaged any fears of forceful removal from the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Concerning Father's letter to C's school, nothing in the correspondence suggested that the Father intended counselling as a punitive measure against C. Mother argued that Father included irrelevant information (such as financial provision) to support his own narrative. Even if true, I failed to see how this could be construed as a threat against C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other minor incidents </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Mother also relied on other incidents to support her case that Father has displayed a pattern of abusive behaviour towards C. The complained actions included (a) the Father ignoring C (7 April), and (b) the Father favouring the second child over C by purchasing food only for the second child (13 April). Separately, these incidents were unremarkable. There was no evidence to show that such incidents were common occurrences. Even if the minor incidents were considered alongside with the key incidents above, I was not persuaded by the Mother’s submission that the Father’s actions displayed a targeted and sustained agenda to exclude, discriminate or demean C which caused C emotional distress. All key incidents happened in the context of sibling disagreements and the Father’s attempts to de-escalate the situation. None of the interactions which the Mother complained of were initiated by the Father. The Father’s parenting methods and his choice of words were lacking but those factors themselves would not satisfy the criteria of family violence even under the expanded definition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Mother also relied on the 7 April 2025 incident involving the Father’s installation of his CCTVs. The Father had installed his CCTVs in the living room and kitchen of the matrimonial home. In response, C wrote the Father a message indicating that she disagreed with the CCTV installation and covered the CCTV with the same message. The Mother claimed that the Father's refusal to remove the CCTV despite C's request caused C distress. The Father explained that he had installed his CCTV after he received the Mother’s first PPO application to protect himself from further accusations. He had also explained his reasons to C via a Whatsapp message which he exhibited. He also claimed that the Mother herself had her CCTVs in the common areas as well. The Mother did not dispute that the Father installed the CCTV after the first PPO application. However, she took the position that C had agreed to the Mother’s CCTVs but not the Father’s. I had a hard time understanding C’s objection to the Father’s CCTV, which was placed in the same area as the Mother’s CCTV. If C’s objection was due to privacy considerations, C would object to both the Mother’s and the Father’s CCTV, not just the Father’s. The Mother could not explain why C consented to her CCTV but not the Father’s. As mentioned earlier, C was not called as a witness and her evidence could not be tested. Even if C had legitimate reasons not to consent to the Father’s CCTV, the Father’s disregard of C’s wishes, did not, in itself, amount to family violence even if C was upset by Father's decision. The Mother also did not submit evidence of the emotional harm which C suffered as a result of the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In conclusion, I found that Mother's claims of family violence against C were not satisfied. The various incidents, whether considered separately or as part of a series, did not exhibit a pattern of behaviour causing emotional abuse to C. Accordingly, the PPO application in relation to C was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Family violence committed against the Mother </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Mother claimed that the Father had committed family violence against her by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     sharing private information about the Mother in the Father’s phone conversation with his brother (incident of 28/3/25)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     threatening to disallow the Mother from using the bed, electricity and gas which the Father paid for (incidents on 29/3/25 and 31/3/25)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother’s position was that she was distressed and suffered emotional and mental harm as a result of the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Mother made similar submissions on the Browne v Dunne rule regarding the Mother’s emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I had briefly explained the effect of the Browne v Dunn rule above. After consideration, I took the view that the Father was not in breach of the rule. The Father’s defence was that he did not commit the alleged acts which the Mother claimed had caused her emotional harm. Therefore, the Mother was not taken by surprise by the Father’s position in his closing submissions even if the Father failed to put his case to the Mother. In the case of Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck cautioned against applying the rule in a rigid manner given that parties were required to exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief prior to trial, thereby ameliorating the mischief which the rule had originally sought to address. Nonetheless, Justice Choo accepted that the rule would still apply, albeit in limited situations, where the point in question was an undisclosed fact which was critical to that party’s case. Justice Choo in the case of Chan Emily declined to apply the Browne v Dunn rule and instead preferred to consider the submissions in totality instead of disregarding part of the submissions which a party had failed to put to the other party. The principles in Chan Emily were endorsed in the subsequent case of Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd in which the Honourable Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon (as he then was) agreed that the court must consider the totality of the evidence and determine if the point which was not “put” to the other party was “at the heart of the matter”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. I found this common-sense approach particularly important in family proceedings, which often encompassed a wide spectrum of evidence across various incidents over extended periods. Additionally, it was unclear if the rule applied to self-represented parties in the same way as legal practitioners given that unrepresented parties may be unaware of its effect. As far as I was aware, there was no case law on this issue. Even if the rule applied equally to the Father, it would be unjust to consider the alleged deficiencies in his cross-examination against him given that the Father’s submissions did not seek to rely on crucial facts which were undisclosed whether through the parties’ affidavits or on the stand. Accordingly, I rejected the Mother's submission in paragraph 20.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident of 28/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></u>: The “Phone call” incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence when he made “deeply distressing and hurtful remarks” about the Mother in his phone conversation with his brother. It was the Mother’s case that the conversation could be overheard by her, the children and V (the domestic helper).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In relation to the contents of the conversation, the Mother made two points. First, the Father was referring to the Mother when he spoke about an individual who was promiscuous. Second, that Father was referring to the Mother's father when he spoke about a family member who had to be bailed out of jail. Mother tendered evidence of Father's conversation from her own CCTVs, which captured only the Father's part of the conversation. The Father's recorded conversation was also incomplete, with various points in the transcript showing &quot;mumbling.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Father denied that he was referring to Mother in either account. Instead, he claimed he was speaking with his brother on unrelated persons. Specifically, regarding insinuations of promiscuity, he mentioned (a) a case in which a student was maliciously accused of rape and (b) the irresponsibility of men when faced with unplanned pregnancies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     It was undisputed that the Father did not mention the Mother's name at any point during the conversation. Even if the Mother was correct in that the Father was gossiping about her, only an individual personally aware of the Mother's history would suspect that Father was referring to her. In other words, only the Mother would have felt offended. Mother argued that her distress was heightened because the conversation could be overheard by the children. However, this would only be the case if the children themselves were aware of Mother's history. It was not the Mother’s case that the children was aware of her history. The Father further contended that the children did not understand the conversation as the majority of the discussion occurred in Hindi. I found that the Mother did not prove on a balance of probability that the children understood the conversation. On the stand, when questioned, the Mother maintained that the children “had picked up some words in Hindi” and understood enough of the language to be able to “put two and two together”. However, she could not explain the basis for her belief. Given that the majority of the conversation was in Hindi, I agreed with the Father that the children would not have understood the conversation. The children would also not suspect that the Father was referring to the Mother as they had no knowledge of the Mother’s past experience. In this regard, I did not find that the Mother's distress was aggravated by the possibility of the children overhearing the conversation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Next I considered the Mother’s first claim that the Father had referred to her when he commented on a promiscuous individual. The Mother contended that Father was referring to her indirectly when he mentioned &quot;slept with someone<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> [21:37-21:41],&quot; &quot;slept with the office manager,&quot; &quot;these people's character is such that they get pregnant right in college... isn't it? [21:37-21:41]&quot; &quot;even he borrowed money and got an abortion done for her,&quot; and the account of a man accused of &quot;trying to do something to her [21:45-21:49].&quot; A review of the transcript did not suggest that Father had referred to Mother, even by implication. Based on the transcript, the Father's various allegedly offensive references were disjointed and did not suggest a coherent account of a single individual's story. There were also no similarities between Father's account and Mother's story that would make the connection with the Mother more than speculative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father had referred to someone &quot;begged from someone else&quot; alongside &quot;slept with someone&quot; before mentioning &quot;slept with the office manager.&quot; [21:37 – 21:41] There was no evidence that the Mother's previous relationship was with an office manager. Immediately after, the Father referred to someone who became pregnant in college alongside purportedly the same individual &quot;borrowing money and got an abortion done for her.&quot; [21:37 – 21:41] Again, it was not the Mother's case that her prior indiscretion involved the lack of financial means for an abortion. In fact, the context of Father's discussion suggested that he was disparaging the character of the man who got the woman pregnant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The next mention of promiscuity occurred approximately four minutes later [21:45-49] about a man falsely accused of &quot;trying to do something.&quot; The discussion pertained to the exposure of a lie and the resulting embarrassment: &quot;how can anyone go back to college after?&quot; There was no evidence that Mother suffered a similar encounter in college in which she made such accusations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Father then mentioned &quot;people who don't even know who the father of their unborn child is.&quot; [21:49-21:53] However, this was prefaced by a reference to a specific individual: &quot;remember that case from the 90s... the officer... for promotion... he was involved with her cousin... yes yes everyone used to say how beautiful she was... No... the Chandigarh case...&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     From the above, I was not convinced that Father was referring to Mother's sexual history in his conversation with his brother. Accordingly, it was not necessary to determine whether Mother had suffered emotional harm as a result.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I next considered if the Father had referred to Mother’s father’s misdeed with the law (second point in the Mother’s claim).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother claimed that the Father had insulted the Mother’s brother and father by referring to the past incident in which the Father had to bail the Mother’s father out of jail. According to the Mother, this was implied in the Father’s recount<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> “She didn’t have anything and came here … what happened was .. the father called … I had to go and get him out … the brother has no guts … what kind of people don’t go to get their father released from jail?” [21:37-21:41] . The Father went on to say “later it came out – the father had a mistress, he took it for her. … he steals lipstick and still acts like wealthy …. [21:41-21:45]”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Father’s position was that he was referring to 2 separate incidents, involving completely different individuals. He also pointed out that unlike the individual in his conversation who father was imprisoned, his father-in-law was not imprisoned. He further stated that he was unaware of the details of his father-in-law’s case other than he had dementia. However, he conceded that that he was referring to the Mother when he spoke about an individual who tried to lecture him [the Father] on morality and on whom he had spent money for the last 15 years [21:41-21:45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Unlike the Father’s comments on the “promiscuous individual”, I accepted that the Father was referring to the Mother’s father in this part of his conversation. The conversation had a logical flow which suggested a single incident involving the same set of actors throughout. In the same flow, the Father also criticised the Mother for trying to lecture him (the Father) about morality, implying that the Mother had no moral standing to criticise him given the lack of morals in her own family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Additionally, there were crucial similarities in the Father’s account and the incident involving the Mother’s father. It was undisputed that the Father had to bail his father-in-law out because his brother-in-law did not do so. These same facts were also in the Father’s conversation. I was not persuaded by the subtle difference between the father-in-law being released on bail as opposed to the actor in Father’s story being “released from jail”. The transcript showed that the Father said “I had to go and get him out.” In the next sentence, the Father had likely used the “jail” loosely to mean police custody, rather than imprisonment. Therefore, I accepted the Mother’s claim that the Father had spoken to his brother about his father-in-law’s run-in with the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I next considered if the Mother had proven on a balance of probability that Father’s actions amounted to emotional abuse. I did not find that the Father’s actions amounted to family violence. The Father’s conversation took place in a private setting with only the family and the domestic helper present. It was not the Mother’s case that the Father had maligned or spread falsehoods about her family. Crucially, nothing in the conversation identified the Mother unless a listener had prior knowledge of the Mother’s personal history. This was unlike illustration (a) of section 58B of the Charter in which the perpetrator <em>spread false</em> rumours about the victim’s promiscuity, causing distress. Although the Mother was understandably upset by the Father’s gossip, there was no evidence that the Mother had suffered emotional distress beyond mere unhappiness with the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Threat or insinuation that the Father could prevent use of bed, electricity and gas: 1/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></u>, 29/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></u>, 31/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Mother’s position was that the Father had intimidated the Mother by threatening to disallow the use of basic necessities in the house. According to the Mother, the threats were made on the following occasions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     01/3/25: when the Father pointed to the bed in the master bedroom and said “I think its time to change the bed that I got.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     29/3/25: The offending statements were made throughout the day:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       9am: to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child: “You like the bed? I wonder who bought it.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>9am: to V (domestic helper): “who paid for the fridge” and “who owns the fridge?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       5pm: to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child: “our $2000 carpet was sold, and she got something cheap.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       9pm: to no one in particular: “must have bought this gas, cooking on it right, has no shame.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     31/3/25:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       “electricity because I pay for it, no.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “if people do not want me to eat then they have to stop using what I have bought in this house. You will not use that gas I bought that gas. Ok. this gas will only be used when I allow it ok?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “gas will only be used when I allow it”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Additionally, during the 9pm incident of 29/3/25, the Mother claimed that the Father followed her closely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father conceded that he made the statements but refuted that he had threatened to deprive the family of basic necessities. In his defence, he claimed that his actions were in response to the parties’ disagreement on the use of kitchen utensils, which the Father perceived as the Mother’s attempts to stop the Father from cooking in the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In my view, the Mother did not prove that the Father’s conduct amounted to emotional abuse. Although the Father’s comments were uncalled for and retaliatory in nature, these could not be perceived as threats given that the Father did not, at any point in time, take action to cut off or make attempts to stop the Mother or V (domestic helper) from using gas, the fridge, electricity, or the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     It was also not the Mother’s case that she was financially dependent on the Father and such ‘threats’ even if not carried out would carry the element of 'coercive control'. For the above reasons, I found that the Father's conduct, although disagreeable and difficult, fell short of causing emotional harm to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As part of her submissions, the Mother claimed that the above incidents along with other episodes exhibited a consistent pattern of conduct by the Father to cause her emotional distress. She cited 2 examples. The first incident involved the Father harassing her through multiple emails on 2/11/24<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, 1/3/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and 31/3/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> which reflected his controlling and gaslighting behaviour. The second incident on 8/4/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> involved the Father asking V for his personal items which did not exist and retaining the Mother’s personal items. Although the Mother was not present during the second incident, it was her case that V was distressed by the Father’s actions which resulted in the Mother feeling distressed. She further claimed that the Father was aware that his actions would “impact the Mother and V”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I found that the incidents, even if considered together, did not establish a pattern of conduct to harass or torment the Mother as she claimed. The emails related to family finances (31/3/25) and the Father’s instructions to V to maintain separate kitchen utensils (2/11/24 and 1/3/25), all of which were legitimate issues pertaining to the running of the household. The parties exchanged less than 10 emails in each instance. Both parties were involved in the exchange, not just the Father. The email exchanges were not prolonged and concluded within the same day. I did not find any of the exchanges to be excessive. Accordingly, I disagreed with the Mother that the Father’s actions amounted to harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As for the second incident, the Mother was herself not present during the incident and relied solely on the CCTV recording. Although she claimed that she suffered distress from V’s messages regarding the Father’s conduct, there was no evidence of the Whatsapp messages. V was also not called as a witness. Given the lack of evidence, I found that the Mother had failed to prove that the Father’s conduct had caused her distress indirectly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In conclusion, the Mother had failed to prove that the Father had committed family violence against the Mother and C. Accordingly, both applications were dismissed, with costs of $450 awarded in the Father's favour in addition to disbursements calculated at 50% of the costs of the transcripts. Notwithstanding these findings, I reminded both parties that they should consider the impact of their actions on the family as a whole. Provocative behaviour and veiled hostility in verbal exchanges would only lead to retaliatory conduct and increased animosity. It was evident that both children had been affected by the stressful and negative home environment. Both parents, as the adults in the family, should make all reasonable efforts to maintain peace within the household in order to protect the children's wellbeing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Annex

I ordered both parents to have joint custody of the child, and that they have shared care and control of the child for half of every week each. I also made orders on access for Hari Raya. The Mother has appealed against my decision. I furnish my grounds below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child was born of the parents in December 2024. At the time of hearing in April 2025, the child was 5 months old, and at the time of my order in September 2025, the child was 10 months old. The child is the only child of the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I shall refer to the parents as “the Mother” and as “the Father” accordingly herein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parents married each other in Singapore in January 2023 under provisions of the Muslim law. The Mother is now 33 years old and is a marketing strategy/planning professional. The Father is now 32 years old and is a head of brand experience. After their marriage, the parents lived in their matrimonial home at Normanton Park.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The child was born in December 2024. The Mother breastfed the child. The parents had frequent quarrels. They had differences over religious practices.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother claimed that the Father forbade her family members from visiting her or the child at the matrimonial home. Later, the Father brought her and the child to his parents’ home. The Mother claimed that she was subjected to harassment and pressure by the Father and his parents to accept their religious practices. She claimed that she was forced to make a choice immediately. The Father pronounced a talak purporting to end the marriage. She signed a document which the Father had prepared that stated that she had no more feelings for him and for the child, and that she agreed for him to have full custody of the child upon divorce. The Mother left the Father’s parents’ home. She claimed that she was not allowed to take the child with her. She filed a police report a day later. She claimed that she was forbidden from taking the child away with her. The Mother also claimed that she had not seen the child even by the date of the first hearing on 2 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Mother’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother filed her application in February 2025. Apart from joint custody of the child to both parents, the Mother sought an order that she is to have care and control of the child, and for there to be no order as to access to the Father. She also sought an order that the Father deliver and hand over the child to her immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father counter-applied in April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father’s case was essentially that it was the Mother who left after a dispute. He alleged that during the “altercation”, the Mother abruptly shoved the child into the Father’s arms, nearly causing him to lose his balance. He claimed that since that incident, the Mother had not actively sought to care for the child, save for her demands to remove the child from the present arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father argued that the child’s best interest would be best served if the child remained in his care and control because of continuity and stability, as the child had been in his care since the Mother left, and also because the Mother’s living environment at her parents’ home was unsuitable due to overcrowding, exposure to vaping activities, and to the presence of multiple pets which posed health hazards to the child. The Father also claimed that he had been the child’s primary caregiver, and was therefore best positioned to provide for the child’s emotional, physical and financial well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I first heard the parties on 2 April 2025. The hearing could not proceed, because the Father had just before that filed his application, and the Mother’s counsel was not yet in the position to respond. I adjourned the hearing to a week later, on 9 April 2025. Given that the Mother had not seen the child for almost 4 months at that time, I directed that the Mother was to have access supervised by a DSSA in the interim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     At the subsequent hearing, I heard the parents’ counsel further. At the end of the hearing, I adjourned the issue of the child’s care and control pending an evaluation to be conducted on the issue and a report be submitted to me. In the interim, I ordered that the child was to be in the care and control of the Mother, and that the Father was to deliver the child to the Mother at 6pm the following day at the Father’s parents’ residence. I further ordered that the Mother was to give the Father access to the child once a week on Saturdays 10am to Sundays 10am. I further ordered for two-way supervised exchange to take place at the DSSA for 8 sessions, and that a review was be fixed by the Court after a report is submitted by the DSSA to the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody Evaluation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Custody evaluators from Community Psychology Hub interviewed both parents of the child, as well as both sets of grandparents and a paternal aunt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The evaluators observed that the child was responsive and smiling the presence of the Mother. They also observed the child to be responsive to her maternal grandmother, and to be comfortable with her maternal grandfather. The child was also observed to be comfortable at the maternal grandparents’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evaluators also observed that there was no resistance nor anxiety by the child to being handed over to the Father. The evaluators also observed the child in the Father’s care. They observed that the return of the child to the Mother was non-eventful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The evaluators found no evidence to indicate that either parent was unfit. Both parents were assessed to have adequate caregiving resources, including stable employment and support for the child’s psychosocial and emotional development. However, their contentious relationship caused them to lose focus on the child’s best interests, leading to disagreements on parenting styles, missed opportunities for breastfeeding, and ineffective communication regarding the child's eczema management, all of which have adversely affected the child's well-being. Taking into consideration the child’s developmental needs, the evaluators recommended that both parents play a consistent role in the child’s life to provide a stable routine and secure attachment. Considering the parents’ tendency for gatekeeping behaviours, they recommended that the parenting arrangements be prescriptive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The evaluators recommended for the parents to be supported by FAM@FSC professional in their coparenting relationship and be given therapy on the developmental needs and milestones of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In consideration of the parents’ and other significant caregivers’ parenting capacities, child’s attachment and developmental needs, as well as the perceptions and relationships of all parties involved, the evaluators recommended that joint custody of the child be granted to both parents, and that shared care and control of the child be granted to granted to both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable laws</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The starting point of my inquiry was to consider section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant …, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I took the term “welfare” in its widest sense, for it is not “possible or desirable to define it” – <em>[IW v IX <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/49128-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 48</a> at (26)]</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In <em>Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey [1987] SLR (R) 725</em>, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was), in reference to the term “welfare”, said (at 551, [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing, religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make up his well-being. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to be measured in monetary terms.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[27] What would be in the interests of the child must necessarily depend on all the circumstances of the case. The court, where appropriate, will have regard to the factors the wife had mentioned, i.e. maintaining status quo, preservation of mother-child bond and that siblings should not be separated. Other factors will include the home environment and care arrangements made for the child, the conduct of the parties, and the wishes of the child. We must reiterate that this enumeration is not meant to be exhaustive. The court will have to carry out a balancing exercise to determine, as between the two parents, to whom custody should be given in the best interests of the child. A factor which may be determinant in one case may not necessarily be so in another. So the weight to be given to each factor may vary from case to case. No precise formulation is possible. This is not a scientific exercise but one of judgment.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the issue of joint or sole custody, I referred to the case of <em>CX v CY <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a></em>, which is the landmark Court of Appeal decision where the principle of joint parenting was endorsed, and which stated that acrimony alone is not considered to be sufficient to justify a sole custody order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[26] The idea of joint parental responsibility is deeply rooted in our family law jurisprudence. Section 46(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (‘the Charter’) exhorts both parents to make equal cooperative efforts to care and provide for their children. Article 18 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the child 1989, to which Singapore is a signatory, also endorses the view that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of their child. Similarly, jurisdictions like England and Australia have adopted approaches that impose on both parents the concept of life-long parental responsibility. With parliamentary intervention in these jurisdictions, the very concept of custody orders was abolished as it was acknowledged that it was in the interests of the child to have both parents involved in his life. There can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I was also aware that sole custody orders may in some situations be justified, again based on <em>CX v CY <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[38] … the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child …. or where the relationship of parties is such that cooperation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of cooperation is harmful to the child.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On the issue of shared care and control, I referred to the case of <em>AQL v AQM <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[8]  …. In my opinion, an order for shared care and control means that the child spends time living with each parent, who then becomes the child’s primary caregiver for the duration that the child lives with him (or her). The right to make the day-to-day decisions on the upbringing of the child therefore rests with the parent the child is presently living with. In the context of shared care and control, it becomes meaningless to speak of ‘access’. This is because the child effectively has two homes and two primary caregivers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[9]    The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances. This is illustrated by two High Court decisions where shared care and control was ordered: in <em>AHJ v AHK <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0148.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 148</a></em> the child would spend Saturdays 8.00pm to Wednesday 11.30am with the mother, and the rest of the week with the father; in <em>AKF v AKG <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0225.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 225</a></em> the same learned judge held that the children would spend alternate fortnights with each parent.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I also noted the High Court’s view <em>in TAU v TAT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[17] The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living. While each parent will separately be responsible for day-to-day decision-making for the child when the child is spending time with that parent, there still remains the potential for harmful conflict. For instance, if the child has left his or her homework at the mother’s residence, will the father be antagonistic to the mother and blame her for failing to attend to this, or will he deal with the matter calmly and supportively? What if this happens often? Thus, while it is true, as the Father submitted, that acrimony between parents does not automatically rule out the possibility of an order of shared care and control, it is a relevant factor in the overall analysis of whether such an order would be in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[18]  Research also indicates that high, on-going parental conflict can make shared care and control “hard for children”, such that “the stress and burden outweighs the benefits for them” in some cases: Caring for Children after Parental Separation at p 8. Of note is an Australian study which found that in high conflict families, “[c]hildren’s experience of living in shared care over 3–4 years was associated with greater difficulties in attention, concentration and task completion by the fourth year of the study”. Similar conclusions were reached in another Australian study: see Jennifer McIntosh &amp; Richard Chisholm, “Cautionary Notes on the Shared Care of Children in Conflicted Parental Separation” (2008) 14 Journal of Family Studies 37 at pp 41–42. As the authors in the latter article eloquently put it at pp 43–44:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… when children of any age make frequent transitions between warring parents who are unable to conceal their feelings in the presence of the child, children then begin to use considerable energy to ensure their own comfort and emotional safety in each environment, actively and constantly monitoring the ‘emotional weather’ they encounter in each parent’s home.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With the above in mind, I arrived at my findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Both parents requested for joint custody of the child. Nevertheless, in the interest of the welfare of the child, I examined the issue of whether an order of joint custody was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I acknowledged that the relationship between the parents was in difficulties. They were leading separate lives in separate households.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, I also took into account the fact that the parents were not divorced. Since the parents were still married, there remained at least a theoretical possibility of reconciliation. It remained to be seen if the parents’ separation was a temporary difficulty or would become a permanent state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I found that the acrimony between the parents was not of such a nature that called for the child to be in the sole custody of either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I also found that both parents exhibited love, care and affection for the child. I had no doubt that the welfare of the child would be best served by letting the child enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of the child had not changed simply because the parents no longer lived together. Therefore, it was crucial that I recognised and promoted joint parenting so that both parents could continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I found there to be no exceptional circumstances such that joint custody ought not to be ordered. Therefore, I ordered that both parents shall have joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Mother sought an order of care and control of the child solely to her. The Father sought for an order of shared care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The child was less than a year old. During these proceedings, the child had been in the Father’s sole care, and later in the Mother’s care. I took into consideration the evidence before me that was found in the parents’ affidavits, as well as the external inputs of the custody evaluators.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I found that both parents were capable of caring for the child during the periods when the child was with them. I did not find their allegations against each other regarding their home environments to be convincing to the extent that either parent ought not care for the child. Therefore, I ordered both parents to share care and control of the child. They shall each have half of each week to care for the child. I provided for access on Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji in addition to the weekly arrangement. I also ordered that the parents were free to modify, whether temporarily or permanently (such as in the event of childcare closures, vacations, or illnesses) any of the care and control arrangements, as long as such modifications were arrived at with agreement of both parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I found it appropriate to approach the case through the lens of therapeutic justice, as explained in <em>TEN v TEO <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24108-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 20</a>:</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[46] … The overarching aspiration of the family justice system is to assist families to move forward positively. Therapeutic justice delivered through a problem-solving court process seeks to allow healing, restoration and recasting of a positive future... It is with these principles in mind, and the welfare of the Children as my utmost concern, that I approached the legal issues in these appeals.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I was conscious that the parents have an acrimonious relationship. At the same time, I was confident that they both want the best for the child. I believed that with professional counselling and therapy, they would be able to parent the child in future, even if their relationship remained estranged. I therefore agreed with the recommendation of the custody evaluator, and I ordered that the parents attend counselling at FAM@FSC. This was to work on their parenting and child development skills, and co-parenting behaviours, with a view to awareness of the impact of their continued conflicts on their child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To encourage compliance and cooperation, I ordered that a penal notice be attached to the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I was also aware that the parents are both Muslims and that they were married under the provisions of the Muslim Law. If their relationship does not improve and they decide to they undergo a dissolution of their marriage, it would take place at the Syariah Court, which will then deal with the issues of custody care and control of the child. I therefore ordered that this order remained in force until such a time if and when the parties divorce and the Syariah Court issues orders on the parties regarding the custody care control and access of the child.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Mental Capacity Act – Statutory Wills"],"date":"2025-12-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OAM 246/2025","title":"In re XVW","citation":"[2025] SGFC 129","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34198-SSP.xml","counsel":["Andrew Wong Wei Kiat (I.R.B.

Ed.) (MCA) provides a legal framework for wide-ranging issues relating broadly to how individuals can protect their interests should they lose mental capacity or how individuals who have lost capacity, may continue to be protected and cared for by others. S 23(1)(k) of the MCA enables a court to direct the execution of a will on behalf of a person who has lost capacity (P) if this advances his best interests<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as defined under s 6 of the Act. The present application was for such a “statutory will” to be executed. The position that Parliament made clear when enacting the provision was for this power to be exercised very carefully and stringently.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The present application was not contested. Having heard from the applicant’s counsel, I dismissed it and provide my reasons for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The applicant is the deputy for his brother, P, an appointment made by me pursuant to his application in FC/OSM 465/2021. They have 4 other siblings. P lived with his late mother in her 3-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat prior to their late mother’s passing. Upon her passing and in accordance with her will, this flat was given to one of her other sons, who I shall refer to as John.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       According to the applicant, John wanted P to stay on at the flat after their mother’s passing and decided to transfer his title and rights to P. The applicant by way of the present application is seeking that a statutory will be executed on behalf of P to allow John to be the sole beneficiary of the flat when P passes away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for the dismissal of the application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">P’s best interests are not served by a “statutory will”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       All the siblings save for one, had consented to the application. The applicant was of the view that the best interests of P would be served by the execution of the statutory will. Counsel for the applicant referred to the court’s decision in <b><em>BHR and Anor.</em></b> v <b><em>BHS<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></em></b> which, drawing on positions expressed by English Courts interpreting similar provisions, spoke of how best interests can be served even after one’s passing in the way one is remembered with affection and for having done the right thing by their will. Given that John had given up his right to the property willed to him by his late mother, the applicant was of the view that the right thing would be for P to “return” the property to John when P passes away. In the case of <em>BHR</em>, P had made a will in 1996 which benefitted her 6 children equally. In 2010, a new will was allegedly executed. The defendant in that case had possession of the will but did not produce it, conveying to the other siblings however, that it was largely of benefit to the defendant. The Court executed a statutory will for P which was substantially in line with the 1996 will in that it provided for the 6 siblings and the issue of a deceased child, equally. The Court stated that “<em>while P’s best interersts would be served by giving effect to P’s wishes, best interests do not cease at the moment of death</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I did not disagree with this. There are other situations where the court might also step in. Clearly where a will was executed that would lead to unjust outcomes or where there are changes in circumstances which make certain provisions in an existing will challenging to execute, the court may intervene. In <b><em>TCZ</em></b> v <b><em>TDA, TDB and TDC</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> a statutory will was directed to be executed for an 88 year old lady who had dementia, on findings of undue pressure by a male caregiver that influenced her into executing a will which provided much of her wealth to him. The statutory will mirrored a will that the lady had executed previously when she was in better health and which left most of her wealth to charity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In the case before me, no will was ever executed by P. It is a situation where P played no part in any exercise involving the HDB flat. To hinge the application on the best interests of P would not be correct. This appears to be a case where the best interests of the family are being advanced. That is not the design behind s 23((1)(k).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reason(s) for having transferred the property to P </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I had asked the applicant’s counsel what the reason for the intial transfer of the property was. I asked if John had other property. Counsel answered in the affirmative but was not able to speak more on this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> FC/OSM 465/2021 which was a matter before me and the supporting affidavit filed in that matter reveals that the applicant had informed the court then that John had paid for the flat to allow his mother and P to stay. When their mother passed away, everyone, save for one brother, felt it is best to let P stay on at the property given that no one could take him in to live with them. John could not keep the flat in his name as he had a HDB property of his own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given that the family did not want to disrupt P’s living arrangement, it appears that John decided to transfer his rights. While I agree that it would be in the best interests of P to keep his living arrangements comfortable, familiar and stable, if possible, the law cannot endorse a position where family members decide what to do at a given point in time to ostensibly advance the interests of P but in effect, preserve their own. It was their late mother’s wish for the property to go to John. She must have had her reasons which I assume to be her belief that John cares and will provide for P. Had she known that John could not hold on to the property in his name, it is not known how she would have dealt with the property given her obvious and understandable concerns about P’s care after her death. However, what we do know is that no one could take P in after their mother’s passing. The family did not want to sell the property and John could not hold on to title to 2 HDB flats. The family did not in 2021 believe that the property ought to continue in P’s name although the representation to the court in 2021 was to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legitimate ways to achieve the same result without compromising the interests of other family members</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The flat could still go to John if that is what the siblings desire. If P predeceases all his siblings, his estate would be distributed in accordance with the laws of intestacy. Given that P’s parents have passed on, he is not married and does not have children, the estate would be divided amongst the very siblings who have come forward for this matter. They are entitled to give their shares up to John if they so wish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There is one sibling who had in the first application in FC/OSM 465/2021 remained silent to the applicant’s request to be appointed as a deputy for P. The reason given by the applicant at that time was that this sibling was abroad and could not get to a Notary to provide written consent on account of the challenging COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He has however chosen to remain silent for this matter too. The applicant had in written submissions to court indicated that he was willing to have 20% of the estate given to the brother who has remained and that the statutory will need only address the 80% share that would belong to the remaining siblings collectively if the laws of intestacy govern the distribution of P’s estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I found this to be an odd position and one that was perhaps addressing the court’s concern that not all the siblings were in agreement. There is nothing stopping the siblings from giving up their shares if they wish to ensure that John ultimately benefits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The position of John’s family was not sought when he chose to transfer his rights to P. Now that it is in P’s name, the entitlements of the families of John and the other siblings may need to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     A court should not have to enable a family to navigate through legal challenges unless what is being sought is clearly in the best interests of P. The intention of the mother was different from the intention of the children. They are concerned for P but at the same time, they want a result that appears to honour their mother’s initial wishes. The purpose of a statutory will is to advance the interests of P and there is little in evidence to show this. Counsel suggested in submissions that the siblings may want to prevent a position where their individual families may raise objections if the siblings attempted to give up their rights to John when P passes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There are ways to address such difficulties but it cannot be through an application which does not meet the best interests of P. The siblings may also want to consider executing their own wills which spell out their intentions in different factual scenarios to ensure that their shares benefit John or his estate. I will leave that discussion to be had between counsel and his client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Granting this application even if uncontested, would be to set bad precedent. The makers of the law call for the courts to be slow in directing statutory wills. In all past cases, there was typically the existence of a will which expressed the autonomy of an individual but could not be carried out or one that was revoked by a later will that was discordant with past expressed intentions of an individual.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     When the applicant sought to be a deputy for P, he asked that he act for P to enable the transfer of John’s rights in the flat to P. This was enabled on the reasons given in that application which included that John could not retain the HDB flat in his name. It appears that there was no intention to retain P’s name as evidenced by the present application which seeks to undo the position at a time P passes away.

Under stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (<em>Eng Liat Kiang</em> at [19], <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [28]). This requires more than merely showing Singapore is not the natural forum; there must be a clearly or distinctly more appropriate alternative forum. The court’s task is to examine the connecting factors to ascertain which forum has the most real and substantial connection with the action (<em>Spiliada</em> at 478 and <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> (“<em>CIMB Bank Bhd</em>”) at [26]). The weight accorded to each factor varies according to its relevance to, and associations with, the particular dispute. A factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might be less significant in another, depending on the factual matrix (<em>BDA v BDB</em> at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">36    If the court concludes at stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that there is no clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum, the court will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, however, the court concludes that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly or distinctly more appropriate, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused (“stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test”). At stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, and the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances to warrant the exercise of the court’s discretion to refuse a stay (<em>Eng Liat Kiang</em> at [19], <em>CIMB Bank Bhd</em> at [26], <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [22]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     With these broad principles in mind, I turn now to explain my analysis of the connecting factors that were relevant to this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ bankruptcy status</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband pointed out that both parties were recently adjudged bankrupt in Singapore. It was not in the best interests of the children to have both parents bankrupt and have their finances limited in Singapore when they had the extended family’s support in Malaysia. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     However, I did not see how the parties’ bankruptcy could, in any principled way, be a factor in favour of a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Although framed in the language of the children’s welfare, the underlying tenor of the Husband’s argument suggested an intention to evade the obligations that flow from his bankruptcy in Singapore. This is not a legitimate forum-convenience consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In my judgment, the fact of bankruptcy did not justify a stay; if anything, it strengthened the connection to Singapore. As parties were bankrupts and subject to the supervision of the Official Assignee, their legal obligations, financial disclosures, and movement restrictions were all anchored in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Pertinently, the division of matrimonial assets could not be divorced from the bankruptcy regime, which necessitated ascertaining the extent of the bankrupt’s estate and ensuring proper supervision by the Official Assignee. As noted in <em>AVM v AWH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17698-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 194</a> (at [115]), only assets which have not vested in the Official Assignee can be divided. There are also statutory restrictions on the disposition of property by a bankrupt: see s 328 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018; <em>Cheo Sharon Andriesz v Official Assignee of the estate of Andriesz Paul Matthew, a bankrupt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0297.xml')\">[2013] 2 SLR 297</a>. The parties’ bankruptcy also had a direct bearing on the issue of maintenance since their financial capacity, the extent of their liabilities, and the constraints imposed by the bankruptcy regime were all matters that had to be considered. These were interlocking inquiries that the Singapore court was uniquely positioned to determine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Far from supporting a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the parties’ bankruptcy entrenched Singapore as the more appropriate forum and weighed against any stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Personal connection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband submitted that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum due to parties’ roots to Malaysia. They were originally Malaysians, and all their extended families remain living in Malaysia. The parties had moved to Singapore in search of better opportunities for business and stayed for some time in Singapore due to the Husband’s successful business at that time. Even when parties were living in Singapore, they travelled between Malaysia and Singapore regularly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband said that when the parties wanted to relocate to Australia but could not do so due to the change in immigration policy in Australia, the parties’ first step was to move back to Malaysia rather than Singapore. The parties then lived in HF’s house. During this period, [A] and [Z] attended international school and [N] attended a local pre-school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband submitted that this would have been the <em>status quo</em> if not for the fact that the parties got into a dispute with respect to the flat in Singapore. The Husband wanted to sell the flat as he needed liquidity for his business, but the Wife wanted to retain the flat. This dispute over the flat led to a series of quarrels and arguments which eventually led to the breakdown of their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband said that the Wife had only moved to Singapore so that she could reside in the Singapore flat to stop him from trying to sell or surrender the flat back to the HDB.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> While he had some business interests in Singapore, he remained domiciled in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> He explained that his business had failed in Singapore and his recourse was to head back to Malaysia to try to build up his business again with the support of his father,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> so that he could eventually repay his debt and discharge his bankruptcy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife said that the parties had always intended Singapore as their permanent home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Prior to purchasing the matrimonial flat, they stayed in rented private properties in Singapore and had several cars, either bought or rented in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> They did not rent out their matrimonial flat even when they left for Perth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife pointed out that all the Husband’s businesses were in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> He incorporated four companies in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> and travelled frequently between Malaysia and Singapore for his businesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> [HC1] was active for 10 years from 2015 to 2025 before it went into liquidation on 7 February 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife also pointed out that as a bankrupt, the Husband was not allowed to leave Singapore without the permission of the Official Assignee. The Husband did not explain why he was still in Malaysia having renounced his Malaysian citizenship nor did he explain how he had managed to leave Singapore as a bankrupt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As the facts in <em>XLV v XLW</em> bore some similarity to the present case, Justice Teh’s analysis of the parties’ personal connection in that case provided useful guidance. Noting that nationality alone should not determine forum choice and greater focus should be placed on domicile or habitual residence, the learned judge reasoned as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37    I deal first with the personal connection of the parties to the competing forums. I agree with the DJ’s conclusion that the parties’ domicile and personal connections to Singapore are factors that lean in favour of Singapore as the more appropriate forum. While the parties’ early history shows ties to China, after relocating from China to Singapore in 2002 and solemnising their marriage at the Singapore Chinese Embassy in 2007, the life choices that they made demonstrate a clear commitment to settle down as a family in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">38    The Husband renounced his Chinese citizenship in 2014 and became a Singapore citizen. As for the Wife, her maintenance of her Singapore PR status since 2009 indicates her own connection to Singapore. More pertinently, the depth of the parties’ connection to Singapore is evinced by their continuous residence here since 2002 until recent years, their acquisition of a matrimonial flat, and their decision to raise and educate both of the Children in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Likewise, the parties’ domicile and personal relocation history in the present case also pointed towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum. The Wife’s account that the Husband had proposed relocating to Singapore and making Singapore their permanent home was corroborated by the undisputed fact they did indeed move to Singapore, obtain Singapore citizenship, and renounce their Malaysian citizenship. Their subsequent move to Australia for about a year did not, on the evidence, suggest any intention to abandon their Singapore domicile in favour of an Australian one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While the family later returned to Malaysia, there was no clear indication that they intended to re-establish domicile or settle permanently in Malaysia. At all material times, they remained Singapore citizens; the Husband continued to have business interests in Singapore; and both parties were bankrupt, which meant that they were not permitted to leave Singapore without the consent of the Official Assignee. The Husband’s decision to remain in Malaysia appeared, on balance, to have been driven by a desire to evade his bankruptcy obligations than by any genuine or settled intention to re-establish his domicile in Malaysia. The Wife, on the other hand, had returned to Singapore with the two older children to live in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Taken together, the evidence pointed to Singapore as the jurisdiction with the closest and most real connection to the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband further argued that the Wife ought to have taken out a relocation application but this had not been done to date. Hence, he argued that the Wife’s move to Singapore was not meant to be permanent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I did not find this submission persuasive. Given that both parties are Singapore citizens and that the children themselves hold dual citizenship, it was unclear why a relocation order would be required in the first place. The Wife and the children, being Singapore citizens with their established home in Singapore, were simply returning home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Proceedings in Malaysia</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As noted <em>XLV v XLW</em> (at [54]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is well established that the existence of parallel proceedings is a relevant factor in the forum non conveniens analysis (<em>MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another v IM Skaugen SE and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24357-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 327</a> (“<em>MAN Diesel</em>”) at [154], citing <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1097.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Virsagi</em>”) at [38]; <em>TDX v TDY</em> at [18]). The existence of parallel proceedings gives rise to concerns of duplication of resources and the risk of conflicting judgments (<em>MAN</em> Diesel at [154]). However, the weight to be given to the existence of parallel proceedings depends on the circumstances, including the degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced, and the degree of overlap of issues and parties (<em>Virsagi</em> at [39], referring to commentary of Professor Yeo Tiong Min in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 75.094).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband submitted that there were already ongoing children and matrimonial proceedings in Malaysia. Both parties had filed applications in the Malaysian courts and thereby submitted to the Malaysian jurisdiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     However, I noted that the Malaysian divorce proceedings were commenced several months after the Singapore divorce proceedings were initiated. Significantly, the Husband was not only aware of the Singapore divorce proceedings but had actively participated in them – he had even filed a cross-application for divorce in Singapore, which he now oddly sought to stay. As his decision to commence parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia was entirely elective, any concern about duplication of resources or perceived risk of conflicting decisions was a situation entirely of his own making.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is trite law that little, or no weight will be given to the fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere: see <em>Harlsbury’s Law of Singapore – Conflict of Laws</em> (Volume 6(2)) (LexisNexis) at [75.109].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my view, it would not be correct to allow the Husband to rely on the risk that he himself had created to stay the Singapore divorce proceedings. This could not be a legitimate basis to support a stay. To borrow the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17116-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 523</a> (at [11]), “it lies not in the mouth of the husband to rely on the rule against duplicitous proceedings having commenced the action in [Indonesia] himself”. Accordingly, I gave no weight to the parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Aside from the divorce proceedings, there were also ongoing proceedings relating to the children in Malaysia. Although the Husband’s stay application was directed at the Singapore divorce proceedings, I accepted that there was some overlap of issues between the Singapore divorce proceedings and the Malaysian proceedings relating to the children, as the ancillary matters in the Singapore divorce proceedings included custody and maintenance issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband submitted that the Wife had clearly taken steps in Malaysia by filing JB-[X2] on 12 November 2024 and an <em>ex-parte</em> application on 13 January 2025 for interim custody of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian proceedings were filed first and were currently at a more advanced stage where parties were proceeding towards a contested hearing fixed on 12 December 2025. Given that there could potentially be conflicting orders made to the custody, care and control of the children, the Husband submitted that the Singapore proceedings ought to be stayed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Citing the case authority of <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a>, a seminal decision of the Family Division which sets out the principles applicable to stay applications specific to custody proceedings, the Husband contended that Malaysia would be the more effective forum to determine the best interests of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     However, given that the core issue before me was the dissolution of the marriage, I did not consider that the overlapping children-related issues materially advanced the Husband’s stay application. The mere existence of custody proceedings abroad did not, without more, justify staying the Singapore divorce proceedings, particularly when the Husband had already participated in the Singapore action and had himself filed an application for access to [A] and [Z] <em>vide</em> SUM 888.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Furthermore, the paramount consideration in any custody proceedings is the welfare of the child. As noted in Debbie Ong, <em>International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at page 244:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Custody disputes are unique because the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. It is not surprising that despite a prior foreign custody order, the court, guided by the welfare principle, may be willing to re-open a custody dispute and determine the case on its merits. The Privy Council, in <em>Mark T Mckee V Evelyn McKee</em>, a case on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada, had held years ago that it is the negation of the welfare principle not to enter into the merits of the question afresh, even where there is a foreign order in existence. Lord Simonds held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But it is the negation of the proposition, from which every judgment in this case has proceeded, namely, that the infant’s welfare is the paramount consideration, to say that where the trial judge has in his discretion thought fit … to examine all the circumstances and form an independent judgment, his decision ought for that reason to be overruled. Once it is conceded that the court of Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the question of custody and that it need not blindly follow an order made by a foreign court, the consequence cannot be escaped that it must form an independent judgment on the question, though in dong so it will give proper weight to the foreign judgment. What is the proper weight will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Given that a Singapore court is not bound by a prior foreign custody order and is obliged under the welfare principle to examine child-related issues afresh in accordance with the welfare principle, the existence of the children proceedings in Malaysia did not justify staying the Singapore divorce proceedings. In any event, the Singapore court may accord appropriate weight to a foreign custody order in the analysis of what would be in the best interests of a child. As noted in <em>XLK v XLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34031-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHC(A) 22</a> (at [40]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The second question, regarding the weight to be accorded to foreign court orders in the analysis of what would be in the best interests of a child, is not a question of law: see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a> at [25]–[28]; see also <em>TUC v TUD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20947-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 1360</a> at [20]–[21]. At its highest, this argument contends that the court should not have given significant weight to the foreign court orders in applying the welfare principle to the facts of the present case. However, it is well-established that the welfare principle requires the court to consider a multitude of factors, and the weight to be given to any one factor involves a fact-sensitive value judgment: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> at [20] and <em>TSF v TSE</em> at [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For the above reasons, I did not find the existence of the parallel proceedings in Malaysia to favour a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Location of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It is trite that the location of the matrimonial assets is a relevant consideration in a stay application. The following observations of the court in <em>AZS v AZR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0102.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 102</a> (“<em>AZS v AZR</em>”) (at [21]) bear this out clearly:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the district judge was also correct in stating that the Singapore courts could deal with the division of worldwide assets in ancillary hearings, some emphasis should also be placed on the fact that the matrimonial properties are located in foreign jurisdictions. For instance, in <em>Mala Shukla</em>, the fact that the parties there had immovable property in India but not Singapore was a pertinent factor in favour of a stay (<em>Mala Shukla</em> at [54]). Similarly here, the fact that the parties have immovable property in France but not Singapore should be a supporting factor for a stay of the Singapore proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Husband submitted that the only matrimonial asset was the HDB flat in Singapore and that the Wife could commence separate proceedings under s 121B of the Women’s Charter 1961 to deal with the HDB flat after the Malaysian divorce had been adjudicated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I did not think that this was a persuasive argument. Splitting the resolution of the parties’ matrimonial issues across two jurisdictions would fragment the proceedings and multiply costs. Moreover, the division of matrimonial assets is ordinarily addressed as part of the ancillary matters flowing from the divorce. There was no sensible basis for compelling the Wife to pursue a piecemeal approach when the Singapore court was already properly seized of the entire dispute. In this regard, the following observations of the court in <em>Mala Shukla v Janyant Amritanda Shukla</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> (at [57]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As Lee Seiu Kin JC said in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">it is more important that the same court consider and decide these matters [meaning the divorce and ancillary matters such as custody and access] than to divide the issues to be decided in separate courts simply because the assets are in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Furthermore, the matrimonial flat was not the only asset in Singapore. As contended by the Wife, the matrimonial assets included CPF monies and various companies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Although the Wife had asserted that all the assets were in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> and that the parties never bought or owned any property in Malaysia during the marriage,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> the Husband claimed that they had two condominiums in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> and his primary business was in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Accepting the Husband’s claim was it was, the location of these assets in Malaysia was at best a neutral factor given that there were also matrimonial assets located in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Availability of witnesses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband claimed that all the witnesses pertaining to the divorce were located in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> This was disputed by the Wife as a bare allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_89\" id=\"Ftn_89_1\"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> The Wife pointed out that the Husband did not establish what the dispute was, if any, that warranted the calling of witnesses or did his pleadings for divorce involved any witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Even if there were any, they could always travel to Singapore to testify or provide evidence <em>via</em> video-link.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_91\" id=\"Ftn_91_1\"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> The Wife said that her witnesses and documents were in Singapore. Travelling to Malaysia for the Wife would be difficult due to her bankruptcy, travel restrictions, and sole caregiving responsibilities for [A] and [Z]. The children would be left alone at home and she would require leave from work as she had been working since the Husband had refused to maintain the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_92\" id=\"Ftn_92_1\"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     While the availability of witnesses is a relevant connecting factor (for example, see <em>AZS v AZR</em> (at [11(a)])), it has also been observed that “the place of residence of witnesses may not be a significant issue in the light of the easy availability of video conferencing”: see <em>Sanjeev Sharma s/o Shri Sarvjeet Sharma v Surbhi Ahuja d/o Sh Virendra Kumar Ahuja</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17594-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 1056</a> (at [24]), citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> (at [69]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In the present case, the Husband’s assertion was vague and unparticularised. He did not identify the witnesses or explain why those witnesses could not travel to Singapore, or why their evidence could not be taken by video-link. In contrast, the Wife had clearly articulated her difficulties in travelling to Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The availability of witnesses was, at best, neutral – and at worst, it leaned against the grant of a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     For the reasons set out above, I found that the Husband had not discharged his burden of establishing that Malaysia was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum. Indeed, none of the connecting factors favoured a stay. Given that Stage 1 had not been satisfied, there was no necessity to proceed to Stage 2 of the <em>Spiliada test</em>: see <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\"

id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff and defendant are sisters. The plaintiff lives in the United Kingdom (UK) while the defendant lives in Singapore. The parties’ eldest sister (P) lived in the UK with her husband for many decades. She now lives in Singapore. The couple do not have children. In 2019, the defendant went to the UK to visit P as P was not in the best of health. During that visit, P’s health concerns appeared to pose challenges for her continued stay and care in the UK. It was decided that P was to move to Singapore and be in the care of the defendant. On 10 January 2022, a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) was executed by P naming the defendant as her donee of power in the event P were to lose mental capacity to manage her personal welfare, property and affairs. Prior to the issuance of this LPA, P had executed another on 2 August 2021. This was rejected by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) due to what the OPG felt was an irregularity with the signature of P found on the LPA. The plaintiff challenged the validity of the creation/execution of the LPA on several grounds. Having heard the evidence, I dismissed the application and the plaintiff appeals against this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Factual Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       P lived largely in the UK from the 1970s. She left for the UK to pursue her interest in hairdressing after completing her ‘O’ level examinations in Singapore. A short period was spent in the US to undertake theological studies before returning to Singapore to be with her parents, during which time she set up a hairdressing salon. With the plaintiff’s own move to the UK for further studies, P decided to return to be of help to her sister. P was married in 1987 to a man who was the landlord of a property P stayed in when she first moved to the UK and who provided accommodation to the plaintiff too when she arrived in the UK. With P’s marriage, she continued to live in the UK until her return to Singapore in June 2019. Her husband remained in the UK till his passing in March 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       P has significant assets in the UK and Singapore. Her Singapore assets included an apartment in the Queenstown area (Queenstown apartment) which she resided at upon her return and continues to do so. P had a property in Jurong which was sold to purchase the Queenstown property. She was able to do so as she retained her Singapore citizenship. This apartment was purchased with the intention of providing a home to her parents. For both purchases, the defendant was given a Power of Attorney (POA) to act for P given that P was living in the UK at the time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the defendant had a licence to practice as an estate agent in Singapore and appears to have knowledge necessary to navigate the real estate arena.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that the parties had a very good relationship prior to difficulties which led to this litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> P was similarly on good terms with both her sisters. It was the plaintiff’s position that P began to show signs of impaired motor control as early as 2008 and appeared to have some cognitive difficulties which progressed over the decade since. In 2019, with concerns over her continued care in the UK mounting, P moved to Singapore and lived in her Queenstown apartment. It was not disputed that P’s relationship with her husband was disharmonious and there were allegations that P was fearful of him. P’s husband had initiated divorce proceedings prior to his death. In any event, her husband was some 20 years older than P and was not in a position to provide continued care for her. The plaintiff and defendant agreed to move P to Singapore, without the express approval of P’s husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A LPA had been executed by P in September 2016<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> in the UK (UK LPA) appointing the plaintiff and defendant as joint donees to manage P's personal welfare and property and affairs in the UK. With P’s move to Singapore in June 2019, it was agreed that the plaintiff would assist in the management P’s assets in the UK<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> while the defendant would assist P in Singapore. On 12 November 2019, P executed a will appointing both the plaintiff and the defendant as joint executrices. The UK will provide for all of P’s UK properties to be divided by the parties equally. Two of the properties in the UK however were held by P and the defendant as tenants-in-common (UK joint properties).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       P had also executed a will on 19 July 2016 for the administration of her estate in Singapore (first Singapore Will). In this will, only the defendant was named the executrix while both the plaintiff and defendant were named the beneficiaries of the Queenstown apartment. Apart from the Queenstown apartment, P had bank accounts in Singapore, some jointly held with the defendant. On 8 March 2021 however, P executed a will in Singapore, thereby revoking the first Singapore Will, and in this later will, the defendant was named the sole beneficiary of the Queenstown property as well as to P’s assets outside of Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The defendant expressed surprise at what this meant as she was under the impression that the UK assets were to be dealt with under the UK Will<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The plaintiff alleged that difficulties arose when she was blocked from access to P by the defendant around June 2021 and that the defendant impeded the plaintiff’s ability to manage P’s assets in the UK. It was the defendant’s position that the plaintiff was attempting to sever what she believed were joint tenancies to the 2 UK properties, which the defendant in fact held with P as tenants-in-common. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff was unilaterally dealing with solicitors in the UK to effect the severance, and to do so, was attempting to activate the UK LPA to deal with matters relating to the UK assets when P was not mentally incapacitated at the time. It was the defendant’s further position that P wanted to sell all her properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       When P’s husband had passed away, the defendant flew to the UK to settle matters arising from his passing on behalf of P. A POA was executed by P on 4 August 2021 to enable this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff questioned the ability of P to execute the POA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The focus of this matter was the LPA that was executed by P on 2 August 2021 and reissued on 10 January 2022 to rectify concerns about P’s signature found on the 2 August 2021 LPA. The irregularity was rectified by having P affix her thumbprint to the LPA on 10 January 2022. It was the plaintiff’s position that P did not have the mental capacity to execute the LPA in Singapore and that it should accordingly be revoked. In this regard, various medical doctors were asked to provide their position on the state of P’s mental health at or around the time of the LPA execution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It was also the plaintiff’s position that the defendant had fraudulently and/or by exercise of undue pressure, induced P into creating/executing the Singapore LPA. A further contention was that the defendant had acted in various ways that showed the interests of P having been compromised and that the LPA ought to be accordingly revoked. The defendant disagreed with all positions taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Did P have mental capacity to create/execute a LPA? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The plaintiff sought to address the issue of fraud/undue pressure in the creation and execution of the LPA first. I was of the view that the core issue would be the mental capacity of P at time of the execution before exploration of the facts that parties relied on to show fraud/undue pressure, or the lack of it. Even as fraud and/or undue pressure are independent factors to consider in an application for a revocation of a LPA, the state of mind of P is inextricably linked to such determination as a poor cognitive state places P in a much more vulnerable position, potentially therefore leading to affirmative responses to requests or quick execution of documents to avoid prolonged conversations, questions or confusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The expression of rational will is rooted in the idea of human dignity. The execution of a LPA, at a time when an individual has the capacity to choose someone to act for him should capacity be lost, is an important expression of that human autonomy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is a challenge to determine if an individual was in fact asserting his choice of a donee of power if that individual was suffering from a neurodegenerative illness at the time. There is a presumption of capacity<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and many neurodegenerative conditions do not signal an inability to execute documents. Indeed the law speaks of the need to avoid treating a person “<em>as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help the person to do so have been taken without success</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Determining whether an individual had the capacity to execute a particular document at the particular time it was executed, must turn on examination of the evidence from medical doctors, relevant observations of those who have been with P, and an assessment of P’s own actions, both past and present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Section 19 of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (2020 Rev Ed.) (MCA) allows for the court to “<em>make declarations as to whether a person has or lacks capacity</em>.” S 4 (1) of the MCA provides the statutory definition of a lack of capacity. The law speaks of an impairment of or disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, regardless of its permanent or temporary nature [s 4(2)]. S 5 of the MCA goes on to provide that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>1</em>)     <em>For the purpose of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>To understand the information relevant to the decision;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>To retain that information;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>To use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>To communicate this decision.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     It is well established that the test for mental capacity as defined under s 4(1) of the MCA has both a functional and clinical component.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While there was some conflict with respect to the time P started experiencing symptoms associated with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the fact that she did suffer from the condition was not disputed. A fair estimation of the relevant time would be around 2010.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Often conditions such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are referred to interchangeably.

As at June 2019, P was not exhibiting any cognitive impairment. Around December 2019, P was experiencing high levels of anxiety and was referred to the department of psychiatry at a public hospital where she came under the care of Dr C. Dr X continued to see P. On 22 February 2021 and again on 8 August 2022, mental assessment tests were conducted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) conducted at Dr X’s clinic showed P receiving lower scores (17/30 and 12/30 in 2021 and 2022, respectively) than when she took a mental assessment test in 2020. Dr X stated that the test score in 2021 already indicated that P had moderate cognitive impairment (dementia).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She was of the view that P had no mental capacity in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Dr C, saw P between 17 February 2020 and 23 July 2024. She was as stated in the preceding paragraph, a consultant psychiatrist at a public hospital and the LPA certificate issuer. She had similarly issued a memorandum to support P making the UK LPA previously. She is also the doctor who issued a memorandum for the activation of the LPA on 23 July 2024. Her opinion, on assessment of P for mental capacity prior to the issuance of the LPA, was that P had the required capacity to execute the Singapore LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     A geriatrician, Dr M, had also seen P but her evidence pertained largely to P’s physical health (osteoporosis and hypothyroidism) when she saw P first on 21 February 2022 (after the execution of the LPA). Despite the limited relevance of Dr M’s evidence, I had the benefit of evidence from 3 integrated disciplines, namely neurology, psychiatry and geriatrics to come to the conclusion I did on the frame of mind of P when she executed the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I did not find the evidence of the doctors to be conflicting in any material way. While Dr X took the position that P did not have mental capacity in 2023, she was not able to say that P’s capacity to make the LPA in August 2021 (and reaffirmed on 10 January 2022) was absent. The only doctor who could provide the court with a relevant clinical assessment of P’s state of mental health at the time of the execution of the LPA was Dr C. In fact, when questioned, Dr X informed that she did not perform mental capacity assessments in her practice and more specifically, she did not conduct any for P. She stated that while mental capacity was not present in 2023, she was not able to speak to P’s capacity in 2022 when the LPA was executed and as a neurologist, she would “<em>usually defer to the psychiatrist</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> in this case, Dr C. The question then was whether Dr C had conducted her examination with sufficient rigour. I found that the answer had to be in the affirmative for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Dr C has some 22 years of clinical experience and is currently a senior consultant psychiatrist at a public hospital. P had consulted Dr C over a sufficiently long period of time prior to the assessment conducted for purposes of issuing a LPA, thus enabling a good rapport to be established.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     P was seen 6 times<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> prior to her assessment by Dr C on 2 August 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> It was Dr C’s evidence that the purpose of the meeting on 2 August 2021 was understood by both P and Dr C to be for the purposes of executing a LPA, although she could not remember whether it was P who told her that she was there for that purpose before the assessment commenced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> While the defendant was present, Dr C explained that as a matter of practice, family members and helpers who accompany patients would sit behind the patient and the answers to questions were given directly to Dr C by P. Dr C had reviewed P’s clinical history and background and was privy to the MMSE and MoCA test scores documented by Dr X during visits by P to Dr X’s clinic. Dr C was of the view that there was no need to repeat the tests as these were simplistic tools and would not have changed much from 22 February 2021 when the MoCA score was 17/30. Dr C was of the view, and rightly so in my view, that clinical assessment was of greater significance in determining whether P was in a position to appoint a donee of power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When questioned by the plaintiff’s counsel on why Dr X was of the view that as at 22 February 2021 and based on the MoCA score, P was said to be suffering from “cognitive impairment (dementia)”, Dr C explained that the terms are defined differently:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“Cognitive impairment and dementia are defined differently….so cognitive impairment just means that there are some ---uh, there was a demonstration of ---uh, deficits when somebody is objectively tested as compared to a normal population. However, dementia is defined differently. Dementia is defined as the presence of cognitive impairment that is severe enough to cause difficulties in a person’s activities of daily living. So, the scores would in---on their own, would indicate cognitive impairment. As a doctor, we would need more information that just the cognitive scores in order to determine the presence of dementia and the severity of the dementia”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 2 August 2021, Dr C observed that P was well oriented, articulate and clear in her intentions as it related to appointing the defendant as her donee to manage her affairs in Singapore. Dr C informed that while P could not tell what the date was, she knew the day and had no signs of psychosis or suicidal ideation. More importantly, P could articulate the difference between a LPA, a POA and a will and when these documents would come into effect. She was also able to give an accurate account of her assets in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> There was no suggestion that P, fluent in English and with sound mental capacity, did not read and understand the LPA before signing it and any challenge to this aspect of the process was not supported by the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Given the refusal of the OPG to register the LPA on account of irregularities with the signature of P which Dr C explained as being likely due to “<em>physical decline from progression of Parkinson’s Disease affecting handwriting</em>,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Dr C had met with P on 3 January 2022 and conducted a review again on 10 January 2022 with the same steps taken as before. During the visit on 3 January 2022, Dr C was informed that P had experienced hallucinations sometime in October 2021 and was admitted to a hospital in November 2021 to address the concerns. Equipped with this awareness, Dr C was mindful of the need to check on P’s state during the clinical assessment for purposes of reissuing the LPA certificate. The steps she had taken in her assessment were similar to those undertaken in the July 2021 session<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and the responses of P as to who she wanted to be her donee and the purpose of a donee were the same. Dr C’s report states that P was “<em>cognitively largely the same as on 2 August 2021</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_f\"></a>(f)     There was no one else who had assessed P at the time the LPA was executed. Dr X who appeared to have suggested that P “likely” did not the mental capacity to manage her affairs as at 22 February 2021, said “<em>I’ll be happy to revise my view. Because I did not do a Mental Capacity Assessment at any point. I was not required to.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Evidence other than that from the medical professionals, support the presence of functional capacity, in particular. There is considerable evidence even as late as December 2021 (after the Singapore LPA of August 2021 was signed by P) pointing to the plaintiff’s desire to activate the UK LPA so that she could deal with the UK properties even though she appears to know that P had not lost her capacity as of that date. The plaintiff wanted bank statements from HSBC in relation to an account P had with the defendant as there were suggestions that money was being withdrawn without P’s authority. In the affidavit of the defendant’s son who in refuting allegations by the plaintiff that he had tampered with P’s mobile phone to prevent communication with the plaintiff, produced a transcript of a conversation the plaintiff had with P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> From the transcript it appears that the plaintiff wanted P to allow for the activation of the UK LPA so that the plaintiff could make necessary enquiries even though she was cognisant of the fact that P had not lost capacity to act for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     A UK based solicitor also provided evidence that all her dealings with P in relation to commercial properties P held in the UK was with P directly. The solicitor made a trip to Singapore on 1 December 2022 and observed that while P was slow in speech, she was alert, could recognise the solicitor, had a healthy appetite and appeared to be well cared for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The plaintiff visited P in Singapore for a brief period between 24 September and 23 October 2019. She shared that P informed her that the defendant was making demands and using monies for her living expenses. Yet the plaintiff felt at that time that they “…<em>would eventually be settled amicably</em>” between P and the defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Neither was any real concern about P’s capacity expressed. Once the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant became tense however, the plaintiff chose to produce messages which she claimed showed that P did not have mental capacity after her return to Singapore. These messages relate to how P felt isolated and at times fearful of the defendant and her son. The plaintiff held on to a belief that P was without mental capacity even though the plaintiff was making such an observation without consistent physical contact with P. Indeed, the ability of P to call the plaintiff and to type coherent messages to the plaintiff complaining of her relationship with the defendant does not signify a lack of functional capacity. It was not disputed that P was in a state of stress and anxiety for which she was referred to Dr C as early as February 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Was fraud/undue pressure exerted by the defendant in the creation/execution of the LPA?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Where there is fraud or undue pressure placed on a donor to induce her to create or execute a LPA, the court may direct that the instrument purporting to create the lasting power of attorney, not be registered or that the LPA be revoked.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In dealing with the allegation by the plaintiff that fraud and/or undue pressure was exerted by the defendant to execute the Singapore LPA, the plaintiff sought to show that there was intense acrimony between the parties, that the defendant intentionally concealed the relevant family dynamics from the certificate issuer, that the defendant was in sufficient proximity to P during the capacity assessment to exert pressure and that the defendant’s own state of mind at the time showed that P’s execution of the LPA had an ulterior motive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Relying largely on <b><em>ULP</em></b> v <b><em>ULS</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> it was the plaintiff’s position that fraud or undue pressure could be exercised even if P had the mental capacity to execute the LPA. This is not in dispute. The facts of <em>ULP</em> however were, in my view, materially different from the instant case. So too were the facts of <b><em>VKX</em></b> v <b><em>VKW</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> which the plaintiff relies on to stand for the proposition that if Dr C was not aware of the family acrimony and dynamics, or if the mental capacity assessment was done in the presence of the defendant, these individually or collectively, should result in a revocation of the LPA. In <em>ULP</em>, the nature and state of P’s dementia, diagnosed to be “<em>moderate stage dementia of the Alzheimer’s type</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> the exceptionally high level of animosity by the son who secured a LPA, towards his father (P’s spouse) and sisters (P’s daughters), the rage displayed by the son towards his father in particular for the latter’s insistence on his son pursuing medicine at a local university instead of chasing his dream of attending an Ivy League US liberal arts college, several acts of the son done secretly including removing P from her home and his absolute refusal to allow any access to P by other family members, led the court to call for greater scrutiny of the LPA.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Indeed the acts of the son if viewed collectively, represented conduct so egregious which made the retention of the LPA unsafe and a consideration of plans for the care of P through a deputyship application was considered a more prudent approach. Similarly, in <em>VKX</em>, P’s mental health was not the same as P in the present case. In <em>VKZ</em> there were 2 feuding camps of siblings. A few of the siblings brought an action against one of their brothers who managed to secure a LPA from his mother. Just as was the case in <em>ULP</em> the feud amongst siblings was a long standing one, dating back decades and its roots entrenched. The defendant went “doctor shopping” to secure a report to validate his appointment as a donee. He removed his mother from her own home, sought a LPA to sell her home and created bank accounts in his son’s name to retain monies belonging to P. He intentionally withheld information on medical reports he was privy to from other doctors concerning the mental state of his mother and he reigned personal attacks on anyone who disagreed with him. The effect he had over his mother when present during medical assessments or even in bringing her to the assessment was of concern in the larger context of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In the present case, the plaintiff and defendant were united in their decision for P to return to Singapore and be under the care of the defendant. P and the defendant held properties and bank accounts jointly signifying that not all things had to be done together with the plaintiff. There was clarity in direction and freedom of communication with a <em>WhatsApp</em> group chat to facilitate interaction. There was a unity of purpose and a reliance by P on the defendant, with no initial resistance by the plaintiff. The fact that P wanted to have harmony amongst them was also evident. The relationship soured only more recently over disagreements with the manner in which properties and financial matters of P were dealt with after P’s move to Singapore. There was no historical hatred or animosity as seen in the cases relied on by the plaintiff. Nor was there deep pressure placed on P as was the case by the sons on their mothers in the 2 cases cited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is certainly important to inform doctors of the fact that there are other family members that may be interested in whether a LPA is issued in favour of another family member. This may likely lead the doctor to exercise even greater care to ensure that no fraud or undue pressure was being placed on P to make a choice. The question remains however as to whether the facts support fraud or undue pressure being placed on P. I was of the view that there was little to support the plaintiff’s view. P was headstrong in her dealings with the UK estate agent on the price she was prepared to sell one of the properties she held jointly with the defendant. She lived in her own apartment in Singapore and was not at the mercy of the defendant for her daily care. Her ability to communicate with the plaintiff allowed her an avenue to signal real distress and pressure if she felt that way. Dr C did not notice any such feelings when she was being assessed. In fact, P who had been seeing Dr C as far back as February 2020 never saw it fit to share about that she had a sister in the UK and the session in February 2020 was one where the defendant was not present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Individuals in any close relationship are at times influenced or even pressured by each other into acting in certain ways. This is why the law calls for evidence of fraud or <em>undue</em> pressure before a LPA can be revoked. The term “fraud” is not defined in the MCA but it is safe to draw from criminal law to look for elements of intentional deception to gain an advantage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The evidence did not support the position that the defendant concealed or represented facts dishonestly so as to compel P to execute the LPA. While fraud was alleged, the plaintiff appeared in fact to be relying largely on the allegation of undue pressure instead. In this regard, the evidence did not point to any excessive or unwarranted pressure. The fact that the defendant was present at the assessment conducted by Dr C can give rise to a suggestion of pressure on P. The evidence of Dr C however was that for mental capacity assessments, it was her practice to seat accompanying family members and caregivers “<em>behind the patient to allow the patient to speak directly to her, without interference</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Dr C was mindful of the need for P to speak freely. At the time P was assessed by Dr C for the purpose of the LPA execution, it was not their first meeting. It bears repeating that previous meetings where P’s family history was taken down and during which time the defendant was not present, would have afforded P the opportunity to share important information which Dr C would likely have addressed, if necessary, when she met P again on 2 August 2021 and 10 January 2022. It also bears repeating that P chose not to reveal the existence of the plaintiff in the UK when she spoke to Dr C as early as 2020. In August 2021 and January 2022, I had no doubt that P was not held back by the defendant in informing about the plaintiff to Dr C, if she had wanted to. The historical evidence shows that she did not think it necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I did not doubt that P would have spoken her mind on things which concerned her when she met Dr C in 2021 and 2022 for purposes of the LPA. In her medical report, Dr C stated that P was calm and coherent during her visit on 2 August 2021 and did not show signs of anxiety or stress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> To come to a different conclusion would be to reject the clinical assessment and observations of Dr C who appeared to have followed all reasonable steps to ensure that P knew what she was doing in appointing the defendant as her donee. While her physical vulnerabilities and age-related feelings of stress and isolation at times, must be acknowledged, she was not in my view, a victim of fraud nor was she labouring under any excessive force by the defendant to execute the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The interplay between mental impairment and undue pressure which was articulated by the Court in <em>Re BKR</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> would require a look at whether P was susceptible to undue pressure given the frailty of her mind. Given that I had accepted the evidence of Dr C who is the certificate issuer and the only doctor who assessed P at the time the LPA was executed, more specifically, that P was “<em>able to express independent thought without seeking reassurance from her caregiver</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that the degree of mental vulnerability did not occasion any feelings of pressure to the extent that the appointment of the donee ought to be invalidated. It must be borne in mind that the specific query before me was the ability of P to execute a LPA freely at the time it was done and not every document that was executed by P. The exercise of determining whether a will or a POA were properly executed may involve different considerations. The defendant’s counsel had asked the court to make findings with respect to the validity of various other documents and transactions. I made no findings as these issues were not before me and indeed a will is a far more complex document which would necessitate further evaluation of the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Has the defendant failed to act/will she fail to act in the best interests of P?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Any donee of power under a LPA or a deputy appointed by a court, must always act in the best interests of the person that is to be assisted. S 6 of the MCA provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)     <em>In determining for the purposes of this Act what is in a person’s best interest, the person making the determination must not make it merely on the basis of –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>The person’s age or appearance; or</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>A condition of the person, or an aspect of the person’s behaviour which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about what might be in the person’s best interests.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)     <em>The person making the determination must consider all the relevant circumstances and, in particular, take the steps specified in subsections (3) to (9).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Subsections 7 – 9 are of particular relevance and reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(7)     <em>Where the determination relates to the disposition or settlement of the person’s property, he or she must be motivated by a desire to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the person’s property is preserved for application towards the costs of the person’s maintenance during the person’s life.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(8)     <em>He or she must consider, as far as is reasonably ascertainable –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(a)     <em>the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and, in particular, any relevant written statement made by the person when the person had capacity;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(b)     <em>the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his or her decision if the person had capacity; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(c)     <em>the other factors that the person would be likely to consider if the person were able to do so.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(9)     <em>He or she must take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them, the views of –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)     <em>anyone named by the person as someone to be consulted on the matter in question or on matters of that kind;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)     <em>anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in the person’s welfare;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(c)     <em>any one of a lasting power of attorney granted by the person; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(d)     <em>any deputy appointed for the person by the court</em>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>as to what would be in the person’s best interests and in particular as to the matters mentioned in subsection (8).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The well-cemented relationship between the parties started to show cracks only in early 2021 when the defendant discovered an email thread between the plaintiff and a UK solicitor regarding the 2 UK properties that the defendant held jointly with P. The discussion related to the need to sever what she thought were joint tenancies (as opposed to tenancies in common) so that it was in line with the intentions of P in her UK will. The defendant was alleged to have then restricted the plaintiff’s communication and access to P and acted in a way that compromised the interests of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In seeking to show that the defendant was not acting or will not act in the best interests of P, the plaintiff pointed to various bank transactions in relation to joint accounts P held with the defendant. She alleged that the defendant was either removing P’s monies away from P’s reach into her own account or utilising P’s monies without proper accounting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> She also sought to show that the sale of various residential properties owned by P solely or commercial properties jointly with the defendant was without P’s agreement and not in P’s best interests. The plaintiff further pointed to the defendant’s failure to pay P’s bills in relation to her properties in the UK. She also pointed to statements made by the defendant to show that the latter threatened to withhold medical treatment for P and that P had not seen Dr C for 2 years after the LPA was executed. She attempted also to show that the defendant’s attempt to restrict the plaintiff’s access to P compromised P’s interests and so too did the execution of the Singapore will of March 2021 which she referred to as a “sham” will and one that was discordant with P’s wishes and interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The various allegations by the plaintiff relating to the mismanagement of P’s assets led the defendant to engage a forensics accountant to look specifically into the management of the 2 joint bank accounts held by P and the defendant (one with HSBC and the other with OCBC), a fixed deposit account held by the defendant (at UOB) and the management of income and expenses relating to the 2 UK properties in the name of P and the defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The accountant’s detailed report did not show any material concerns with respect to the management of P’s assets by the defendant such that it warrants a conclusion that the defendant failed to act in the best interests of P or that she will not act in the best interests of P moving forward as it relates to the administration of P’s affairs in Singapore. This does not mean that each and every transaction cannot be further questioned in an appropriate forum. Simply that for purposes of determining if the defendant had P’s interests at heart, the accountant’s report showed a pattern of the defendant acting to protect her equal share in various assets and one that ensured P’s assets are kept for her needs, consistent with the need to maintain her continued stay in Singapore. The accountant essentially took the position that the monies in the joint accounts used to receive rental incomes from the jointly held UK properties could be attributable equally to P and the defendant. Following from that, payments or transfers from that account into a Singapore account could be treated as equally owned. A significant exception being the property jointly owned by P and her late husband, the sale proceeds of which was recognised by the defendant to be P’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The report drew criticism by the plaintiff who stated that the accountant worked on the information provided by the defendant alone and there was a paucity of documentary evidence to show that certain expenses could be safely said to be P’s expenses. In response, the accountant confirmed that he worked only with the information and documents provided by the defendant and that he was open to providing a supplementary report if the plaintiff wanted to provide him with more information. None was forthcoming. Neither did the plaintiff engage her own expert to scrutinise the report. Much of the information would also be available from the UK where the plaintiff resides. While the burden of accounting for monies belonging to P was rightfully placed on the defendant, the burden cannot be an onerous one calling for perfect responses to quick allegations of mismanagement. The plaintiff had gone so far as to suggest that the accountant himself did not explicitly confirm that he relied on professional and ethical standards in drawing up his report. He had confirmed his professional standing as a chartered accountant licensed to practice in Singapore and by this fact, compelled to abide by professional and ethical standards.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also lodged a rather abrupt request for the court to make an order for the appointment of an “independent expert” when this was not a specific prayer in the originating summons. While s 18 of the MCA allows a court to direct a donee of power to render reports and accounts, it was unclear as to the basis for the plaintiff’s call for an “independent expert”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Several allegations of the plaintiff appears to be made so as to press the defendant to respond to her suspicions as opposed to any evidence that she may have. This was seen for example in her insistence that the defendant had kept P’s HSBC bank tokens from P so as to perform unauthorised transfers. This was so even when P herself had indicated that she misplaced them. The defendant had during her visit to the UK in August 2021 approached the bank to apply for a new one which could only be done with P’s authorisation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The defendant exhibited communication with a bank officer showing that she had tried to obtain a new token to replace the one that was lost and that there was a need for for P to provide the mandate for the issuance, which was later obtained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In relation to the sale of P’s properties, there is little to support the position that P’s interests were not being served. The process involving the sale of one of the UK properties held jointly with the defendant, saw P actively engaged with estate agent and insisting that it be sold at GBP 1.6 million and not anything less even as the agent pushed for a lower price which was against his own interest insofar as it related to his commission.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> P appeared to be acting independently of the defendant in entering into such a sale. The sale of a property P held with her late husband similarly saw P speaking directly to the estate agent and insisting that it be put up for sale at no less than GBP 1.35 million based on a 2022 valuation. Conversations between the plaintiff and P about discussions that P had with the defendant over the sale of these properties point to the fact that the defendant was not secretly compelling P to enter into property transactions to the detriment of P. There was a desire for all 3 sisters to discuss the plans of P to sell off her properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The change of the contents of the first Singapore Will in March 2021 and the mental state of P when this was executed were not the subject matters for determination. Regardless, there is evidence that a month prior to the execution of this will, Dr C had seen P and noted that there were no psychiatric issues that P was experiencing. Additionally, P was noted as being able to correct herself when she made mistakes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Notwithstanding, the execution of the will and P’s testamentary capacity remain an open issue. The defendant’s counsel was of the view that I should make a finding on this. I disagree on account of the fact that the matter before me involved the need to look at the nature of a LPA and the situation P was in at the time it was executed, in addressing the plaintiff’s request to revoke the LPA. Documents executed before and after may lend towards this determination but a finding on P’s capacity in the execution of each and every document was not what was sought by the plaintiff. It is an exercise far more involved, requiring an assessment of what P understood to be her assets at the time of the execution of the Singapore will in March 2021 and why she had changed her mind on who her beneficiaries were, including the import of Clause 4. The solicitor who drafted that will would also be someone whose evidence may be helpful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It was well in line with the need to care for P in Singapore that an appointment of a suitable donee based in Singapore be made. The rising tensions between the plaintiff and defendant at a time when P’s cognitive ability was on a downward trajectory made this an understandable need. There was little in evidence to show that P must have wanted to appoint the plaintiff jointly with the defendant to care for her needs and affairs in Singapore simply because there was a joint appointment for the UK LPAs. P had in the past dealt with the defendant to the exclusion of the plaintiff as evidenced by the 2016 First Singapore Will which named the defendant as the sole executor. She also held properties jointly with the defendant and not with the plaintiff. There were also numerous POAs authorising the defendant to deal with the sale and purchase of properties in Singapore for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The plaintiff’s position that the defendant had in the past threatened to withdraw medical treatment for P and her restricting the plaintiff’s access to P was more in my view, a reflection of the tensions between the parties rather than a desire to prevent the advancement of P’s interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Even though Dr C had not been consulted for the last 2 years after the issuance of the LPA, consultations continued with the neurologist Dr X and the geriatrician Dr M, in 2023 and 2024. There is a consistent position taken by all doctors who were managing her care. By early 2024, P’s condition had progressed such that palliative services were required and no further follow up was necessary with the 3 doctors. Dr C in particular had indicated that as at 2024, no treatments were necessary to treat any psychiatric symptoms or behavioural disturbances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The plaintiff’s position that the defendant and her son were restricting access to P even going to the extent of removing P’s old phone and tampering with other technological devices was not supported by the evidence. There is on the other hand, evidence showing that P managed to contact the plaintiff using P’s new phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Having said that, the tensions between the parties would make it entirely conceivable that the defendant was not making it easy for the plaintiff to have access to P. I could not conclude that this, if intentional, was targeted at compromising P’s interests even if it would be an ancillary effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The central question for determination was whether P had properly executed an LPA appointing her sister, the defendant, as the sole donee of power to handle her matters in Singapore should P lose her mental capacity to do so. If so, should she be permitted to continue with such appointment given what the plaintiff saw as acts which breached or is likely to breach the defendant’s duty to advance the interests of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The medical evidence points to P having had the capacity to make the appointment of a donee and she did so freely. The doctor who assessed P at the time the LPA was created/executed had taken all reasonable steps to accurately ascertain the capacity of P. She was aware of mental state tests done by Dr X previously, these tests being tools that provide practitioners with an idea of whether further investigations are necessary. Even as Dr X was doubtful of the capacity of P to execute the LPA, she agreed that she did not conduct a mental state assessment at any point in time and that she can only categorically state that P had no capacity in 2023. Clinical observation and assessment were only done by Dr C and was sufficiently robust for this court to rely on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Even as the plaintiff took the position that P was suffering from cognitive impairment that must have prevented P from executing an LPA that met the requirements of s 5 of the MCA, her own conversations with P even after August 2021 and the words and acts of P especially in dealing with solicitors and estate agents show not just an ability to make an appointment, but the absence of any fraud or undue pressure from the defendant in the creation of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The holding of properties jointly with the defendant, the appointment of the defendant as the sole executor of the 2016 first Singapore Will (which the plaintiff herself acknowledged was understandable given that the defendant was the only one residing in Singapore),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> the execution of POAs for the defendant to deal with the sale and purchase of the Jurong and Queenstown properties, respectively, the united understanding of the plaintiff and defendant in better times, for the defendant to care for P while she was in Singapore point collectively to the need to preserve the autonomy of P in her choice of the defendant as the donee of power. As s 3(4) of the MCA provides, respect must be had for choices made even if it is felt that P made an unwise decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The larger question was whether P’s best interests were compromised by the defendant necessitating a revocation of the LPA. The accountant’s report showed that P’s interests were not compromised such that the LPA would need to be revoked. Clearly proper accounts would need to be maintained by the defendant and she remains accountable for P’s monies, the proceeds from the sale of P’s properties and for the personal welfare of P - an obligation that has been activated and which will continue unless revoked or upon P’s passing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     A fear of losing financial entitlements is often found behind arguments that appear to be advancing the interests of mentally incapacitated individuals. Such arguments are veils. It would help parties to address these fears more directly and resolve differences between themselves, so as to mend the fracture in their relationship that has only recently surfaced.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 30 of the defendant’s affidavit of 5/9/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The are 2 brothers in the family, one of whom has passed on.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>There were 2 separate LPAs, one addressing personal welfare and the other, property/affairs.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of 29/5/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Clause 4 of the 8/3/2021 (Singapore Will).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 48 of the defendant’s affidavit of 5/9/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>As P was the joint owner of a property with her late husband, this too came to be held in her sole name upon his passing in addition to properties she already held solely in her name.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of the defendant’s affidavit of 18/11/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>S 3(2) of the Mental Capacity Act.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Ibid. s 3(3).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup><em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a> (HC); <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17722-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 81</a> (CA).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Page 24 of Dr X’s affidavit dated 18/2/2025 and page 84 of Dr C’s affidavit of 4/3/2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Tanner, C.M. &amp; Ostrem, J.L.

class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 November 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was an ancillary matters hearing where orders were made at the conclusion of hearing on custody, care and control, division of assets and maintenance. The Mother, being dissatisfied with the outcome, has appealed against the entirety of my decision. I had provided brief grounds at the conclusion of the hearing. I provide my full grounds herewith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother filed for divorce on 28 November 2023. Through the course of the proceedings, she had failed to comply with court directions and absented herself from hearing and mediation sessions on multiple occasions. This led to the present ancillary matters being heard some 21 months after the divorce was filed on 13 August 2025. In the midst of the proceedings, the Mother also filed an application under s 69 of the Women’s Charter for a lump sum maintenance of $2,580,000 for herself and her children on 3 December 2024. As interim maintenance had already been awarded, I directed that this maintenance application be heard together with these ancillary proceedings, which were originally scheduled to proceed by March 2025. It bears noting that this was not the first maintenance application made by the Mother – an earlier maintenance summons (MSS XXX/2024) filed on 3 May 2024 was dismissed on 4 December 2024 due to her failure to attend the hearing on more than one occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       By way of context, there were also various allegations of family violence and harassment traded in the course of the proceedings. The Mother first filed SS XXX/2023 on 8 December 2023 seeking a personal protection order for verbal abuse by the Father. The matter proceeded to trial but was dismissed, with the Mother being noticeably absent when the Court delivered its decision. The Mother then filed a further application for a personal protection order in SS XXX/2024 on 13 May 2024, on behalf of herself and her children, for alleged family violence on the part of the Father. This was struck off at first mentions due to the Mother’s absence from the proceedings. The Father himself filed for a personal protection order on 19 July 2024 in SS XXX/2024 alleging that the Mother had struck him on his neck and head. A personal protection order was eventually issued in the Father’s favour, and parties were ordered to attend mandatory counselling at FAM@FSC. There was also a protection from harassment suit filed by the Father in PHC XXX/2024, involving allegations of verbal harassment by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Given the complexity of the matter and the high level of acrimony between the parties, the case was docketed before myself from February 2025 onwards, to handle the remaining ancillary and maintenance applications as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       This matter concerns a 19-year marriage. The Plaintiff (“Mother”) and the Defendant (“Father”) were married on 31 May 2004. Although the Mother filed for divorce on 28 November 2023, her Statement of Claim was eventually struck out on 15 October 2024 as she had failed to file her Reply and Defence to Counterclaim despite being granted two extensions of time. Interim judgment was accordingly granted one year later on 29 November 2024, on the facts stated in the Father’s Counterclaim. Since then, the matter has been further delayed because of the Mother’s refusal to file her Affidavit of Assets and Means, as well as to comply with discovery obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Both parties are 47 years old. The Father works as a Director of Business Development at a pharmaceuticals company. The Mother is a Non-Executive Director at a family-owned manufacturing company situated in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are two children to the marriage, R and T. R is male, aged 14 years, and T is female, aged 10 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Prior to 26 May 2025, parties resided together at a rented apartment in Chancery Court. The lease for that property terminated on 26 May 2025. The Father and children then stayed together at another rented property at Belmond Green, while the Mother initially resided at guest rooms at the Tanglin Club, before renting an apartment at Stevens Road.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The parties own a matrimonial property as joint tenants (“the Proximo apartment”). This was tenanted out under a 24 month tenancy, which was due to expire on 16 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parties filed two Affidavits of Assets and Means each. The Father also sought to refer to affidavits filed in the discovery process, his pleadings, as well as related affidavits in the family violence, harassment and maintenance applications, and affidavits filed by the Mother’s former solicitors in their discharge application. The following chart lists the affidavits considered in these ancillary proceedings:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There was no agreement reached on any aspect of the ancillary matters. Accordingly, it fell to the court to determine:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The custody, care and control of R and T;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The division of matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Spousal maintenance for the Mother and maintenance for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children’s Issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties’ Positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother in her affidavit of assets and means asked for full custody, care and control for both children, on account of her track record in caring and raising them since birth. In the alternative, she sought shared care and control, with the children to spend four days with her and three days with the Father each week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father’s position was to request for full custody, care and control of both children. This request was premised on the Mother’s deteriorating emotional and psychological state over the course of proceedings, which the Father argued had manifested in erratic and volatile behaviour towards himself and the children, the Mother’s former legal team, the Father’s own legal team, and even to the Court itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In his pleadings, the Father detailed numerous incidents reflecting the Mother’s decline in mental stability. It was pointed out that throughout the marriage, the Mother had experienced sudden mood swings and personality shifts, which escalated to signs of mental instability some time in 2019. According to the Father, the Mother began isolating herself from friends and extended family and compelled the Father to do the same. She was also alleged to exhibit violent behaviour, which involved digging her fingernails into his hand and using profanity in conversations and texts directed at him, including calling him derogatory remarks such as “a sociopath”, “a eunuch”, “a fool” and “a piece of faeces”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father also detailed episodes of verbal aggression, emotional instability, irrational accusations, and unpredictable behaviour on the part of the Mother, that have directly impacted the children, the Husband, and extended family members. Several incidents were witnessed by the Mother’s own parents, close family friends, and police officers who responded to multiple non-emergency calls made by the Mother. The Father also pointed out that the Mother compulsively overspent on the children’s extra-curricular activities, depleting her own savings in the process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father specifically highlighted an incident on 15 July 2024, which was the subject of his application for a protection order in SS XXX/2024, when the Mother physically assaulted him while he was tending to their unwell daughter. This assault occurred in the children’s presence, and involved strikes to his face, head, neck and arms. The injuries were supported by medical evidence, and the Court accordingly granted him a personal protection order on 27 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father also pointed out the manner in which the Mother’s former solicitors, Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP, applied to discharge themselves following a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship. In their Discharge Affidavit dated 11 September 2024, the Mother’s lawyers averred that there was a “serious loss of confidence” between the parties. According to her former solicitors, the Mother had repeatedly questioned the firm’s competence and integrity, and accused them of siding with the Father, for example, stating that they were “<em>pandering to [Clifford Law’s] every request</em>” and “<em>constantly sid[ing] with the other party</em>.” Her former solicitors also pointed out that she refused to provide instructions for the filing of pleadings and affidavits despite multiple follow-ups, and ultimately refused to attend the court-scheduled trial on 5 September 2024 in PHC XXX/2024. The firm was granted an Order of Court for discharge on 15 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On account of her erratic behaviour, the Father argued that the Mother displayed a disturbing inability to manage her own affairs. In his view, her ongoing refusal to seek medical help raises grave concerns as to her ability to provide a stable, secure, and emotionally safe environment for the children. Accordingly, the Father sought sole custody, care and control of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     With regard to access, the Father’s position was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Mother was to have access once a week on Friday evening from 5 pm to 8 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to school holidays, the Father proposed that there be no access for a period of six to 12 months from the determination of the ancillary matters, and that there be limited access thereafter in the following manner, subject to the Mother undergoing medical treatment and being found to be of sound mind:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Two days (9 am to 5 pm only) during the one week March holidays</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       One week (9 am to 5 pm only) during the four week June holidays</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Two days (9 am to 5 pm only) during the one week September holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       One week (9 am to 5 pm only) during the six week November-December holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There be no overseas travel without the Father’s consent and the children’s agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Court’s Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Section 124 of the Women’s Charter 1961 provides that in making orders relating to the custody, care and control and access to a child, the court should take into account the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. In making this assessment, the Court of Appeal in <em>CX v CY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a> has given guidance that the court generally leans in favour of joint parenting, at [26]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">There can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus, in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     While joint custody is generally the preferred arrangement, I agreed with Counsel for the Father that there are circumstances where sole custody may be warranted, particularly where the conduct or condition of the other parent compromises the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In this particular case, having been docketed to this matter and seen parties for more than half a year, I have witnessed unusual, disturbing, erratic and offensive behaviour from the Mother both in court and in her correspondence to the court. Despite countless warnings not to write in administratively on matters before the court, to desist from copying external parties in contravention to s 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014, as well as to ensure that the other party is copied in correspondence addressed to the court as required under the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions 2014 (paragraph 168(2)), the Mother has repeatedly and flagrantly persisted in writing to court in breach of these directions. Her repeated practice of copying emails to her relatives and even her discharged solicitors is particularly egregious, as it undermines a fundamental tenant of family proceedings, which under s 10(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 should be held in private by default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother’s conduct in court has also been decidedly rude and contemptuous at various points in the proceedings. She constantly disparages the Father for being incompetent and inferior to her in intelligence and education. Her behaviour went beyond the pale at a discovery hearing on 18 June 2025, where she made derogatory comments about the caste of Father’s counsel, suggesting to the court that counsel carried no credibility because she belonged to a caste which had assassinated a previous prime minister of India. Even after being sternly warned by the court that such views had no place in Singapore, much less in a court of law, the Mother persisted in making such derogatory comments, and did not withdraw them on pain of contempt. The Court eventually did not proceed with contempt proceedings only because the Father’s counsel charitably shrugged off these comments, and expressed her preference to expedite matters rather than to cause delay with a separate set of contempt proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother’s behaviour in court is also consistent with various police reports filed by the Father, as well as affidavit evidence provided by the Father and the Mother’s father and brother, in addition to audio evidence tendered by the Father, of various disturbances and altercations caused by the Mother while she was living with the family in the Chancery Court premises, as well as her rude and disparaging treatment of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having considered the evidence in totality, I accepted that there was ample evidence in this case to suggest that the Mother would not be fit in her present state of mind to exercise joint custody over the children. She has repeatedly demonstrated behaviour that is contemptuous, rude, and most inexplicably, contrary to her own interest in the proceedings. One particularly perplexing episode involved the Mother’s repeated refusal to file her Affidavits of Assets and Means, even though it was she who had initiated divorce proceedings as the plaintiff. The court’s initial direction was for the First Affidavit of Assets and Means to be filed and exchanged by 24 January 2025. This was later extended multiple times to 7 March, 13 March, 17 March and 28 March 2025, with the final deadline accompanied by an unless order, i.e. that if the Mother failed to so file, the court would take it that she is not submitting any affidavit evidence in the ancillary proceedings. Despite these directions, by the time of a case conference held on 15 April 2025, the Mother’s ancillary affidavit had still not been properly commissioned and filed. The Mother’s explanation for her non-compliance was that she was impecunious and did not have the money to travel down to the courthouse and the CrimsonLogic Service Bureau for the purpose of commissioning and filing her affidavit. To prevent any further delay, the Court made a special arrangement for a court commissioner to be present at the case conference to commission the Mother’s affidavit on the spot, to ensure that the document was properly filed and the ancillary matter could proceed. Had the Court not granted the Mother such exceptional latitude, she would have had no evidence at all to rely on in these ancillary proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It was thus with great consternation that the Court discovered, with the revelation at the ancillary hearing of the Mother’s spending habits at the Tanglin Club after her departure from the family home on 26 May 2025, that the Mother had racked up bills amounting to $12,937.32 in the month of July 2025 and was able to make payment of $7,000 towards this expenditure (see P1). The Mother’s alleged impecuniosity was thus totally fictitious, and it was apparent that she had intentionally breached court directions and an unless order over the course of January to April 2025 by withholding the filing of her Affidavit of Assets and Means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother has further displayed her erratic and contemptuous behaviour by refusing to provide even basic discovery despite being ordered to do so. This has persisted even at the present hearing where she preferred to disregard her CPF contributions to the property rather than share her CPF statement with the Father’s counsel. Mindful that the Mother was a litigant in person, much effort was taken to explain her obligations in discovery and the implication of withholding such evidence from the Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That the Mother flagrantly refused to access her CPF statement despite repeated exhortations is clear evidence of her dysregulated behaviour and flawed decision-making process, which in turn raises serious questions about her ability to make considered decisions for the welfare of the children. While there is no medical diagnosis of the Mother’s mental state available (as the court does not have the power to compel a party to seek medical treatment in divorce proceedings), the Court must act in the best interest of the children to ensure that a parent exercising access is in the correct frame of mind to make the right decisions in regard to their care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this regard, I note that in other cases where a parent displayed a mental health condition or erratic behaviour that belies an impaired ability to make decisions in the child’s best interests, the courts have taken on board such considerations in granting sole custody to the other parent. In <em>AVM v AWH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17698-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 194</a>, the High Court granted the wife sole custody of the children because the husband’s behaviour demonstrated that he had a poor ability to make decisions for his own welfare. His conviction for possession and consumption of illegal drugs, his promiscuous lifestyle, and the circumstances by which he contracted HIV had shown a reckless failure to exercise personal responsibility, which in turn justified the grant of sole custody to his wife. In <em>ACU v ACR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0322.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 322</a>, the court accepted that the wife’s reactive depression and her threats to threats to commit suicide would have been relevant to considering the grant of care and control to the other parent (at [46]). On the facts of the case, this was not necessary as the medial report suggested that her reactive depression was temporary and did not inhibit her care of the children. The point remains though that where a parent is demonstrably unfit to make decisions in the best interest and welfare of the children, sole custody and care and control can be granted to the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I considered the present case to be an exceptional one where joint custody would not be appropriate, given the Mother’s behaviour in court and multiple incidents and altercations at the family residence. I was of the firm view that the interest and welfare of the children would be best served by giving the Father sole custody in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Turning to care and control, I note that the Father had been the primary caregiver in recent times with the Mother’s increasingly erratic behaviour, and had taken an active role in their upbringing, including the management of their schooling, the handling of their daily routines and seeing to their physical and emotional well-being. In particular, the children have resided with the Father since the parties’ separation and share a close, stable relationship with him. The Father is also assisted by a domestic helper, whom the children have adapted well to living with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In contrast, I note that even prior to the separation, the Mother had begun to withdraw from the family and isolated herself in the bedroom. She did not cook or clean for the family, chain-smoked incessantly, and lived on coffee and peanuts. The children have also complained about the cigarette smoke in the house when they were living together with their mother, which caused them to be uncomfortable with her breath.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also note that the children have expressed their wishes to live with their father and not their mother. In particular, I note that R had complained to the Father that the Mother had exposed herself in front of him and that he was shocked and embarrassed by this incident. This was expressed in an email by R to the Father dated 13 July 2024, which read as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">After my shower, I went into my sisters room to say hello to her, mama then walked in and asked if her bum looked good, then proceeded to lift her dress up and show us her bum. I was thoroughly disgusted and asked her to stop as I walked away. In the master bedroom, I was putting cream on my arms when mama walked in and asked if her breasts looked good, and lifted her dress up and showed me her breasts; without any bra on. It was truly an uncomfortable experience that I wish would never happen to anyone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I have further noted the express wishes articulated by the elder child against the Mother being granted custody, although I do note that the preferences of minor children are not necessarily a conclusive factor in the determination of what is in their best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Taking the evidence in totality, I was satisfied that the Mother’s behaviour suggested that she did not have the ability to provide appropriate care for the children on a day-to-day basis. The children had been effectively estranged from her by her erratic behaviour, and she had not participated actively in their daily care since the onset of her mood swings and extreme behaviour. I therefore agreed with the Father’s position that he should have sole care and control of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to access, as a starting point, I agreed with the Father that access could be granted to the Mother on Friday evenings for three hours from 5 pm to 8 pm. This arrangement ensures that the school week is uninterrupted, and also facilitates the Mother in arranging for full-time employment post-divorce. Going forward, a greater scope of access would be granted to the Mother if (1) the Mother attends at the IMH for a detailed assessment by a psychiatrist on her mental state of health, and attend any follow-up treatment or take any such medication that the doctor deems necessary, and (2) the doctor provides a full medical report that shows the Mother to be free from any mental condition that may impair her ability to care for the children. Should these conditions be satisfied, an expanded scope of access can be granted to the Mother as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Additional weekend meal access over three hours every week, at a time to be agreed between the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School holiday access in the format as proposed by the Father (in paragraph 19(b)(i)-(iv) above); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Three hours of access to the children by the Mother on each public holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     At a later date, should the Mother complete her consultation and her situation stabilises, parties may mutually agree to a greater degree of access, or may file the necessary variation application should they be unable to do so amicably. I would add that the passage of time alone may not be sufficient to constitute a material change of circumstances – one would need to see that the Mother has taken concrete steps to improve her mental and psychological state of mind before there can be a step up of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s position at the ancillary hearing was that this was primarily a single income marriage of moderate duration. The Father noted that in <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a>, the Court of Appeal had observed that while long single-income marriages justified an equal division of matrimonial assets, “moderate-length marriages” (of approximately 15-18 years) would justify awarding the non-income earning spouse approximately 35% to 40% of the matrimonial pool (at [113]). Accordingly, the Father submitted that a 60:40 division in his favour would be an equitable division under the <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20026-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 15</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) approach for single income marriages. To effect this division, the Father was prepared to pay the Mother 40% of the market value of the matrimonial home less the respective CPF contributions, with fees for the transfer, including all administrative fees and legal costs, to be borne equally between the parties. The Father was also willing to buy over her Tanglin Club Membership at the current market value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     At the outset, I did not consider this to be a single-income marriage to be determined in accordance with <em>TNL</em>, as both parties had worked and contributed to the household for substantial parts of the marriage. In particular, the Mother had worked in senior roles as an investment banker prior to 2014 and contributed to the household income in the earlier half of the marriage. Accordingly, the structured approach for a dual income marriage as established in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a> should apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     This approach involves the following steps:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Determine the total matrimonial pool in accordance with s 112 of the Women’s Charter (1961) by aggregating the jointly held matrimonial assets, as well as assets held in each party’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Determine the parties’ direct financial contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions to the well-being of the family, considering both financial and non-financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Derive the parties’ overall contributions by averaging the two ratios, with possible adjustments based on the circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Apply the ratio to effect a division of the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial Pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     There was little dispute over what constituted the matrimonial pool, save for a Mumbai property which the Mother had declared (at the hearing) to be purchased pre-marriage. I accepted that premise and excluded that property from the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As the Mother did not provide any evidence of other assets or the valuation of her Tanglin Club membership, I accepted the Father’s valuation that the latter would be worth at least $100,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Accordingly, the matrimonial pool, based on the available evidence provided by the Father, would comprise the following:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"

The Father noted that despite directions from the Court, the Mother had not provided any documents or explanation regarding her financial position or contributions to the matrimonial assets, save for attaching a copy of her membership cards at the Tanglin Club and the Singapore Cricket Club (which were not helpful to even estimate the value of such assets). The Father submitted that the Mother’s refusal to provide supporting documentation has rendered any evaluation of her contributions to the matrimonial pool to be virtually impossible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I accepted the Father’s arguments that the Mother was in contumelious breach of her discovery obligations. She had failed to provide even the most basic of documents relating to her income tax, CPF, bank account statements and investments in her Affidavits of Assets and Means. Neither had she provided any evidence aside from bare assertions on her direct and indirect contributions towards the matrimonial pool. Further, despite a contested summons for discovery filed by the Father (in FC/SUM 1167/2025), which was eventually granted in the whole save with regard to the Mumbai property, the Mother’s compliance affidavit was completely devoid of the required financial documents, and failed to explain whether such documents were in her power, possession or control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It was also amply clear during the ancillary hearing itself that there was a property which the Mother jointly owned with her mother, but had failed to declare in her Affidavit of Assets and Means.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The fact that the Mother could make payment in the sum of $7,000 towards her Tanglin Club bill in July 2025, and could afford her rental for her current apartment at Stevens Road, further suggests that the Mother has a bank account or some other asset which she is drawing upon for her daily needs, which she has failed to declare for the purposes of the ancillary proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     As noted above, I also found that the Mother’s excuses for non-compliance simply did not hold water. Her claim that she was homeless and impecunious after the termination of the lease of the Chancery Court apartment flies in the face of the expenditure racked up during her stay at the guest rooms Tanglin Club after moving out from the family residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I note that in <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16823-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 2</a>, the Court of Appeal held that an adverse inference may be drawn where a party has failed to make full and frank disclosure, especially when such non-disclosure hampers the just and equitable division of matrimonial assets under section 112 of the Women’s Charter. In <em>CHT v CHU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25844-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 38</a>, the Court of Appeal further held at [6] that where an adverse inference is drawn, the Court has the power to give effect to an adverse inference by either including what it finds to be the value of undisclosed assets in the matrimonial pool (the valuation approach); or by ordering that the other party receives an uplift on his/her share of the known assets (the uplift approach).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Under the present circumstances, the Father submitted that the Mother’s conduct justified the drawing of an adverse inference in the most serious terms, as it deprived the Court of the ability to properly assess the Mother’s true financial circumstances. The Father submitted that the most appropriate course would be for the Court to adopt the uplift approach and grant him an uplift of 10%. The Father also submitted that the Court in inferring that the Mother is withholding information regarding matrimonial assets in her possession, should treat her alleged entitlements conservatively when determining division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I agreed with the Father that the Mother’s breaches of her discovery obligations effectively prevented the Court from conducting a proper inquiry into the equitable distribution of matrimonial assets. The valuation approach would not even be applicable in this case as the Mother’s true asset pool is a complete black hole and there are no known assets to which a value can be effectively tagged. Accordingly, an uplift would be appropriate to penalise the Mother for her failure to disclose matrimonial assets in her possession, and also reflect that she may be concealing other matrimonial assets. In the circumstances, I granted an uplift of 8% to the overall ratio in favour of the Father, mindful that this would correspondingly reduce the Mother’s ratio by 8%, resulting in a final ratio of division of 68.1 : 31.9 as between the Father and the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders on Division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Given that the Mother had deliberately withheld her CPF statement from the Court, as well as the real possibility that she had failed to declare other substantial assets in her name, I considered it would be more equitable to apply the ratio of division to the matrimonial home only, and to allow the parties to retain the other assets in their possession. To do otherwise would be to grant the Mother a share of the assets declared by the Father that were held in his sole name, in particular, the substantial amount of $334,713.62 in his CPF Account, without any corresponding consideration to him from her own undeclared asset pool. I consider this to be manifestly unjust. Under such unusual circumstances where there has been a clear and complete dereliction of the Mother’s obligations in discovery, I decided that it would be more equitable to apply the <em>ANJ</em> ratio for division to the matrimonial property alone, and to allow the Father to retain other assets held in his own name. I also do note in this regard that there was a jointly owned asset in the form of a Land Rover, registered on 19 August 2016, with presumedly one year left to its certificate of entitlement. The net value of the car was determined to be $23,178.52 as at the date of the filing of the Father’s first ancillary affidavit (i.e. 15 April 2025), and would have depreciated further by the time of the hearing on 13 August 2025. As such, I considered this asset to be <em>de minimis</em> and disregarded it for the purposes of the division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As the net value of the matrimonial home has been established to be <b>$2,332,396.14</b>, the Father’s share at 68.1% would be <b>$1,586,029.38</b>, while the Mother’s share would be <b>$746,366.76</b>. As the Father wishes for the matrimonial home to be transferred to his sole name, he would have to transfer the Mother a sum of money that fairly represented her share of the asset. Given the Mother’s complete failure to provide discovery, I considered that her retention of the Tanglin Club Membership (the value of which is estimated to be $100,000) should be deducted from her share of $746,366.76 of the value of the matrimonial home. Accordingly, the division of assets would be effected by having the matrimonial home transferred to the Father’s sole name upon his payment of the sum of <b>$646,366.76</b> to the Mother. I would add that parties should bear all administrative and legal fees equally, and the transfer shall take place within six months. The usual Registrar’s Empowerment Clause is to be included in the terms of judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     By way of footnote, I would point out an errata in my brief grounds which reflected the Father’s share of the matrimonial home to be <b>$1,593,493.04</b>. This was a calculation error and the correct sum should be <b>$1,586,029.38</b> as reflected above. In any case, this did not affect the final order, as the amount that the Father had to transfer the Mother to reflect her share of the matrimonial home was computed based on the value of the Mother’s share, which was correctly reflected in the brief grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Recovery of Rental and Loan Repayment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As the Mother had moved out of the rented home from 27 May 2025 after the expiration of the lease, the Father should account for her share of the rental proceeds of the matrimonial home from that point until the end of the tenancy on 11 October 2025, covering a period of about 4⅓ months. This amounts to the sum of $12,458.32, which should be payable as a lump sum at the end of the tenancy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     However, I note that the Father had paid off the Mother’s Education Loan with OCBC Bank <em>after</em> the interim judgment date of 29 November 2024. While the Mother claimed that this sum should be borne by him as <em>quid pro quo</em> for her earlier payment for his MBA degree during the marriage, I did not agree and considered her contribution in this regard to be reflected as part of her indirect contributions made throughout the course of the marriage. Once the interim judgment was granted, liabilities should lie where they fall and insofar as the Father had paid up in full for a sum of $16,800 for which both parties were jointly and severally liable, I would allow him to recover half that amount (i.e. $8,400) by netting this sum off from the rental proceeds of $12,458.32 owed to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In short, the Father is to pay the net sum of $4,058.32 to the Mother by 11 October 2025 (the date of the expiry of the lease on the matrimonial home). I would also allow the Father to deduct from that sum any outstanding cost orders that remain unpaid by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Spousal and Child Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Mother sought spousal maintenance in the sum of $10,000 a month, or a lump sum payment of $2,000,000 in her maintenance application (MSS XXX/2024). I note in this regard that the Father’s monthly income is about $18,000, and his offer was to pay her $1,000 a month for a maximum period of 12 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     It is axiomatic that while the overarching principle embodied in spousal maintenance under s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter is financial preservation, i.e. the wife should be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage, the award of maintenance for a <em>former </em>wife should also take into account the fact that she should regain self-sufficiency and not assume life-long dependency on her former husband (see <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [31]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I agree with the Father’s position that the Mother should find gainful employment within 12 months, given her stated views on her capability and high earning power. By her own account, the Mother is highly educated, possessing a master’s degree, and had previously worked at a directorial position in a bank where she was paid $30,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As to the quantum of spousal maintenance, a proper analysis is made difficult by the Mother’s failure to itemise her expenses as well as any passive income from existing assets. As interim maintenance was provided in the sum of $500 in addition to the payment of her regular bills at the Tanglin Club, I would direct that a higher spousal maintenance of $1,200 should be provided to the Mother for the period of 12 months or until she finds gainful employment, whichever is earlier. I considered the Mother’s requested sum of $10,000 per month (or a lump sum of $2,000,000) to be completely disproportionate to the Father’s income of $18,000. It also disregards the fact that he will be paying for the upkeep of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     As for child maintenance, the Father has set out the children’s monthly expenses, which amount to $500 for R and $1,428.67 for T. Thus far, the Father has been solely responsible for all the children’s expenses since 2014, when the Mother resigned from her full-time employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Father’s position on child maintenance is that the Mother should contribute $1,000 per month towards the children’s maintenance upon securing employment, or after a period of 12 months, whichever is earlier. The Mother’s position, as found in her MSS application, was that each child should be paid a lump sum maintenance of $290,000. This position is superseded as the Mother will not be receiving care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     While it is a well-established principle that both parents have a joint and equal duty to maintain their children, and that the Mother should therefore contribute towards their upkeep by the Father once she achieves gainful employment, I am mindful of her present mental state, and would be cautious about imposing any requirement for her to pay maintenance at this stage. We would need to see the nature of her employment and her income level to properly ascertain the appropriate sum of her contribution towards child maintenance. This will have to be applied for at a later stage once she finds employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders for MSS XXX/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As maintenance issues have been resolved globally in the ancillary matters, I make no orders with regard to MSS XXX/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Coda on the Mother’s Mental Capacity to Conduct Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Following the ancillary hearing, and after the orders made were extracted on 21 August 2025, the Mother filed her appeal on 26 August 2025, and appointed fresh counsel to make further arguments by way of letter on 2 September 2025. The further arguments related to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Procedural Fairness</b>: Given the Court’s expressed concerns about the Mother’s mental state, and that she had conducted the proceedings without the appointment of a court friend or the benefit of independent psychiatric evidence, Counsel for the Mother requested for the ancillary matters to be addressed properly now that legal representation was secured.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Custody and Access:</b> The access order on Fridays 5-8 pm was unworkable due to the children having enrichment classes during that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Direct Contributions disregarded and uplift for adverse inference:</b> The Mother’s claimed direct contributions of $200,000 downpayment toward the matrimonial property and undisclosed CPF payments were excluded as they were not presented in affidavit form, and an uplift was applied for adverse inference. Now that the Mother has family support and legal representation, the Court was requested to reconsider how these contributions could be dealt with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Mother’s new solicitors expressed that the appeal was filed merely to preserve the Mother’s rights, and invited the court to grant a short audience to address the Court properly on the above matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     By way of a reply dated 8 September 2025, the Court declined to accept further arguments in the matter as the time for appeal had lapsed. It was clear to my mind that the Court was <em>functus officio</em> as final orders had already been extracted on 21 August 2025. In the response, it was also stated that “a perusal of the record of proceedings will show that the plaintiff was able to fully comprehend the proceedings and articulate her arguments for the case.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Nevertheless, as the issue of the Mother’s mental capacity to conduct proceedings is likely to feature in the appeal, I take the opportunity to elaborate on my observations as to the Mother’s mental capacity to conduct proceedings on her own behalf in this ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     At the outset, I would point out that it is possible for a person suffering from a mental health condition to have the mental capacity to litigate, even her mental state renders her unfit to exercise custody and have care and control over the children. The two issues involve fundamentally different inquiries. The former is concerned with a person’s ability to understand and follow the proceedings, and articulate his or her own views and responses. The proclivity of a party to make unsound judgment calls or bad decisions in the court process do not concern the court, so long as the party’s cognitive and reasoning abilities are intact. However, in assessing whether a party is fit to exercise custody, care and control over a child, the ability to make sound and cogent decisions in the best interest and welfare of the child is paramount. In this regard, a parent with sufficient cognitive skills to comprehend the conduct of litigation may in the same breath be considered incapable of exercising sound judgment in the care of a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant Legal Principles on Mental Capacity to Litigate </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The starting point when addressing mental capacity of a litigant is Rule 656 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as applicable to the present case), which states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>656.</b>—(1)    A person under disability may not bring, make a claim in, defend, make a counterclaim in, or intervene in any proceedings, or appear in any proceedings under a judgment or an order notice of which has been served on him, except by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Subject to these Rules —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>a</em>)    anything which in the ordinary conduct of any proceedings is required by a provision of these Rules to be done by a party to the proceedings must, if the party is a person under disability, be done by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>b</em>)    anything which in the ordinary conduct of any proceedings is authorised by a provision of these Rules to be done by a party to the proceedings may, if the party is a person under disability, be done by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    A litigation representative of a person under disability must act by a solicitor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Under Rule 654, a “person under disability” is defined as a person who is a minor or who is “a person lacking capacity”. The latter is in turn defined to mean “a person who lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act in relation to matters concerning his property and affairs”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The test for mental capacity is set out in s. 4(1) of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (“MCA”), which reads,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is <b>unable to make a decision for himself or herself in relation to the matter</b> because of an <b>impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain</b>.” (<b>emphasis added</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The test under s 4(1) of the MCA consists of a Functional Component and Clinical Component. The Functional Component relates to a patient or party being “unable to make a decision for himself”, while the Clinical Component relates to whether this inability stems from an impairment of the mind. The Functional Component is a matter for the Court to decide based on the evidence as to the degree that P’s mental functioning is compromised, while the Clinical Component is addressed with the assistance of medical expert evidence, per [134] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The definition of what constitutes inability to make a decision is further provided in s. 5(1) of the MCA as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.—(1)    For the purposes of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    to understand the information relevant to the decision;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    to retain that information;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)    to communicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Two observations are apposite at this point. First, the presence of a mental health condition does not automatically mean that a person lacks capacity. It must be shown that he or she was unable to make a specific decision at the material time, because of the mental health condition. For example, in <em>Re GAV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0125.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 125</a>, it was held that P had the mental capacity to make decisions for himself even though he suffered from schizophrenia. At [11], the court held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it was clear from the medical evidence that P suffered from schizophrenia, some schizophrenia patients can, with treatment, lead relatively normal lives. As such, <b>the existence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia did not in itself mean that P must automatically be determined to lack capacity</b>.” (<b>emphasis added</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Second, it is specifically provided in s 3(4) of the MCA that “(a) person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because the person makes an unwise decision”. The focus is not on the consequences of a decision, but the capacity to make that decision. The Court of Appeal elaborated on this principle in <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a>, where it stated, from [175] to [180], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An unwise decision does not, by itself, mean that he or she lacked the ability to decide on that matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The test is whether that person is able to understand the information relevant to the decision and, if yes, whether he or she is then able to use and weigh all that information in the process of arriving at the decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The ability to use and weigh the relevant information requires him or her to engage with the countervailing considerations relevant to the decision and measure the pros against the cons in a non-arbitrary manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Feelings and intuition may play a part in the decision-making process. The key lies in the ability to engage with all these factors, rather than allow one or some of them to dominate the decision-making process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother was able to Make Decisions For Herself in the Course of Proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I had the opportunity to consider the application of the above principles during my personal observation of the Mother at in-person hearings on six occasions on 6 February, 17 March, 15 April, 13 May, 18 June and 13 August 2025. She presented as a person who was confident, extremely articulate to the point of being argumentative, with a clear ability to explain her actions, raise objections and provide rebuttals against the points made by Father’s Counsel in the course of proceedings. I also noted that the Mother had a tendency to ramble about irrelevant matters, and constantly ignored the court’s guidance to constrain herself to the relevant issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     A perusal of the Notes of Evidence of the ancillary hearing on 13 August 2025 would reveal that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother was able to raise objections to the admissibility of the Tanglin Club statement of accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother was able to articulate her arguments for joint custody and the importance of topics such as health, education, religion, enrichment and other activities to be done in joint consultation between the parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother was able to rebut Father’s Counsel submission that her daughter was embarrassed by her presence at school, by pointing out that she had volunteered at the school’s Racial Harmony Day, and that her daughter had been coaxed by the Father into stating so in the affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother was able to provide supporting reasons for her having care and control in her reply on child issues, showing that she was able to understand and follow the arguments made in proceedings so far. She was also able to articulate her reasons for refusing to undergo medical examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_e\"></a>(e)     When asked if she refuted the Father’s position that she kept to the bedroom and did not interact with the children, the Mother was able to explain that she kept an arms length distance because the Father had called the police in an earlier incident which resulted in her being remanded overnight at the police station, and that she did interact with and teach the children while the Father was on business trips.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Mother had disputed the valuation adopted by Father’s counsel and adduced a more appropriate valuation of $2.67 million which was eventually agreed upon by both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Mother was able to provide relevant information to support her indirect contributions, and propose a ratio that should apply to her indirect contributions, showing that she had understood the court’s earlier explanation of the workings of the <em>ANJ</em> test.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The conclusion I came to after observing the Mother over the course of half a year was that while she was frequently irrelevant and irreverent in her responses, she clearly understood the matters being discussed in the proceedings, and was able to put forth relevant arguments to support her position. The fact that she took disadvantageous positions in respect of discovery and the filing of her ancillary affidavit does not necessarily imply that she lacked the ability to make her own decisions. As earlier observed, the ability to decide does not connote the ability to decide well. For the same reason, raising concerns over a person’s mental health condition does not <em>ipso facto</em> connote that the person lacks the mental capacity to litigate or requires a litigation representative. There was no doubt in my mind that the Mother had the mental capacity to represent herself and conduct proceedings on her own behalf in this ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Having concluded the matter, I invited the parties to address on costs. The Father’s counsel graciously submitted that there be no order as to costs. Accordingly, I directed that there be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In closing, I wish to highlight that litigants in person cannot expect to take advantage of their own ignorance or perceived inadequacies to play fast and loose with the rules of adjudication. While the judge may exercise some latitude to ensure that the litigant in person receives a fair day in court, this should not be interpreted as laxity or weakness in the face of litigants who seek to proverbially have their cake and eat it. The Mother is one such litigant. Having stymied the court process repeatedly with her absenteeism, non-compliance and complete disregard for the rules of discovery, she has to bear the price of her disregard for the court process and suffer the consequences of her refusal to abide by its rules. That she only decided to appoint counsel and seek to re-open the matter after an adverse outcome at the ancillary proceedings speaks volumes of her lack of respect for due process and fair play.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Having said this, I do urge the Mother to take stock of her circumstances and accept that the path to reuniting with the children and establishing her own self-sufficiency are one and the same – that she should consult with medical health professionals to better understand her own state of mind and regulate her behaviour accordingly. It is a pity that a long marriage had suddenly turned south in recent years due to circumstances which appear to be beyond parties’ control. There is still hope that normalcy can be achieved after the divorce, with a proper addressing of these root causes that have so unfortunately resulted in the couple parting ways. It is my sincere hope that parties can find a fresh start and head on the path to recovery and healing, and that future differences can be resolved in an amicable manner, without resort to further litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     By way of summary, I list out the following orders that were made at the conclusion of the ancillary hearing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>1.

Under that order, the Father was to pay $300 per month as maintenance for his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of this matter on 31 October 2025 and allowed the Mother’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As a starting point, there was no dispute between parties that the arrears came up to $4500 as of 31 October 2025 (including the maintenance owed for October 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Because MSS 1903 was filed on the 26 of August 2024, prior to implementation of the new Maintenance Enforcement Process,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> it is clear that the relevant provisions in force at the time, namely, s 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961, were applicable to the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Having heard the evidence of parties, it was clear that the Father had not provided good reasons as to why an enforcement order should not be made against him: <em>XHQ v XHR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32809-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 10</a> at [6] citing <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father explained to me that he was last employed as a technician from April to December 2024. He was paid a monthly sum of $1800. Since then, he had not been employed, and his bank account had been closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The reason for the closure of his bank account was because that account had, allegedly, been used for a scam. The Father had lent his bank account to his cousin. The reason for this, according to the Father, was that his cousin had told him that he had just gotten a job and needed a bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Since then, the Father had tried, but was unsuccessful, in attempting to open a bank account. The banks had flagged him as a high-risk customer and refused to let him open an account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He says he had sought the assistance of his Member of Parliament, but “nothing came out of it”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He told me that without a bank account, it was very difficult for him to find work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He told me that he had resorted to “do[ing] things”, including “illegal ones” such as selling SIM cards to survive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Even accepting that the Father had landed in this predicament because he had lent his bank account to his cousin out of the goodness of his heart, this alone, was not a good reason to not enforce the order against him. That is because this is the second time the Mother had come to court to enforce the order against the Father. As the Mother explained, the son had special needs, and she had been borrowing money to keep up with his expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given that there had already been a previous enforcement application against the Father, it should have been clear to him that he had to take the necessary steps to put his finances in order so that he could support his son. While there was some attempt on his part to do so,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> it was evident, by the fact that the Mother had to file a <em>second</em> enforcement application, that he had not done enough in respect of his finances, to keep up with his maintenance obligations towards his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I thus concluded that the Father had not demonstrated good reasons as to why the arrears should not be enforced against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As to how these arrears should be paid off, I was inclined to give the Father time to get his affairs in order, get back on his feet, and to do his part for his son. That was because the Father had told me, in his testimony, that he understood that he had a responsibility to provide for his son, and acknowledged that he could not continue to engage in illegal activities which would only land him in more trouble, and cause the arrears to snowball.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He also acknowledged that while he was unable to make payment, he was trying to “sort this out”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I ordered that the Father pay off the arrears of $4500 in monthly instalments of $50. These payments shall start from 1 June 2026 and be payable on the 1st day of each month thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     For the avoidance of doubt, because there was no application to revoke, suspend, or vary the existing maintenance order, the current maintenance remained payable.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See s 45(13) of the Family Justice Reform Act 2023 which states: “Subject to regulations made under subsection (15), despite sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(b), sections 69, 71, 71A, 71B, 71C, 74, 75, 76, 77, 121, 121G(2) and Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before the date of commencement of sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(b), continue to apply as if sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(b) had not been enacted.”.
