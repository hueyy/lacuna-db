There are two children of the marriage namely, <b>[Child 1]</b> (m) DOB xx October 2013 aged 10 years and <b>[Child 2]</b> (m) DOB xx July 2016 aged 7 years (“the said 2 children”). The marriage lasted about 10 years before the Mother filed Writ of Divorce on 7 January 2023 in FC/D xx/2023 in Singapore. The Father filed his Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) on 12 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Interim Judgement was granted on 12 June 2023 based on the fact that the Mother had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Father had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) and the marriage was dissolved by reason of the unreasonable behaviour of both Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       By consent, the issues of interim joint custody, with care and control of the said 2 children to the Mother and access to the Father, were resolved in a Court Order dated 18 April 2023. The Parties are now undergoing Discovery and Interrogatories under the divorce case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the meanwhile, the Mother filed MSS 1022 of 2023 on 8 May 2023 seeking interim maintenance for herself and the said 2 children, which application was heard before me on 4 September 2023 and 27 October 2023. In her application, the Mother sought the payment of $5,000.00 per month (being $2,500.00 per child) as maintenance for the said 2 children and the sum of $2,000.00 per month as maintenance for herself from the Father. For both hearings, the Mother was represented by Counsel whilst the Father, who is a lawyer, represented himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father’s case was that he had been paying $2,500.00 per month for the said 2 children’s maintenance and their additional miscellaneous expenses such as Coding classes and Taekwondo, when presented with the receipts by the Mother. The Father was of the view that the Mother’s claim for $5,000.00 per month as maintenance for the said 2 children, was inflated and unreasonable<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father was also of the view that no maintenance should be payable by him to the Mother as she had started working since July 2023 and she had the ability to earn a significantly higher salary than what she was currently earning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. The Father submitted that up to 2019, the Mother was a Senior Staff Nurse at [A] hospital dealing with chronic diseases and could earn about $5,000.00 per month. The Father also submitted that the Mother had not made any effort to find a full-time job commiserate with her experience and it was a deliberate decision by the Mother to take on a part time job at $2,000.00 a month when she had a full-time helper<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s case was that prior to their separation in December 2022, the Father was solely bearing all the family’s expenses of around $6,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. It was submitted that the Mother’s total monthly expenses was at $2,483.33 and the elder child’s total monthly expenses was at $3,458.50 with the younger child’s total monthly expenses at $3,226.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the Mother’s position was that the Father’s payment of $2,500.00 per month for the said 2 children’s maintenance was grossly inadequate<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. It was also submitted that the Father used to pay $500.00 for the Mother’s maintenance until he stopped paying this after June 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was further submitted that the Father had an earning capacity of up to $22,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and that he had confirmed that he would not pay what the Mother considered to be reasonable maintenance, without an Order of Court. The Mother asked for a fixed maintenance sum as it was submitted that it was “impossible” to get reimbursement from the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also wanted the maintenance payable by the Father to be back-dated to January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s Appeal</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As the Father’s appeal was filed first in time, I will deal with the Father’s appeal first. The Father has appealed against Clauses 1 to 5 of my Court Order in MO 489/2023 dated 27 October 2023. In effect, that is the entire Court Order that I made regarding the Mother’s application for interim maintenance for the said 2 children as I did not order any maintenance to be payable for the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In making my decision on the Mother’s application, I noted that the caselaw principles for interim maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter is clear. The Court of Appeal had said in the case of <b><em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0506.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 506</a></em></b> that the objective of section 69 applications is to provide the Wife and children with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help them overcome their immediate financial needs having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors listed in section 69(4). The “immediate financial needs” approach was adopted because section 69 applications are not final maintenance applications as this comes after the Ancillary Matters in the divorce case is finalised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Therefore, in my view, the key considerations for the payment of interim maintenance for the said 2 children were (i) the reasonableness of the monthly expenses of each child (ii) the income ratio disparity of the Parties and (iii) the Parties’ financial capacity to pay such maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I was also guided by the case of <b><em>APE v APF <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a></em></b>, wherein the Honourable Justice Tan Siong Thye held [at paragraph 43] that “<em>It is trite that maintenance is ordered in order to meet the reasonable needs of the child and if the child’s lifestyle is overly extravagant, the husband should not be made to bear the costs of it</em>.” And [at paragraph 45]: “<em>In arriving at my decision, I noted that the wife was indulging the child in many things which might be nice to have but were not reasonably necessary for the child’s needs</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My assessment of the said 2 children’s reasonable monthly expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I was of the view that as the Parties were currently undergoing divorce proceedings, it would be in the best interests of the said 2 children to minimise the acrimony between the Parties by providing for fixed maintenance wherever possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     However, at the same time, I also took into account the Father’s position he was happy to pay in full for the said 2 children’s maintenance expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> but that he needed proof of what he was paying for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, to be fair to the Father, I was also of the view that variable expenses would require the Father’s prior consent before he should be made liable to pay for such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In consideration of the above, and after taking into account the Parties’ positions, my assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses for the elder child was in the last column below as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.28145629125825%\"><col width=\"29.005801160232%\"><col width=\"20.4440888177636%\"><col width=\"22.0844168833767%\"><col width=\"21.1842368473695%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>ITEM</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">School related items </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$200.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Additional school fees of $65 and also school excursions at about $20.

At the same time, I assessed that the income ratio disparity of the Parties was at 85% (Father) vs 15% (Mother), which was confirmed by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the issue of capacity to pay, I noted that the Father had testified that his current income was at the nett amount of $11,297.00 per month and after paying his own total monthly expenses, which included the sum of $2,500.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> that he was currently paying for the said 2 children’s maintenance, this would leave him with the monthly disposable income of around $4,000.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> or the sum of $6,500.00 disposable income per month excluding the said 2 children’s maintenance. I further noted that the Father had himself testified that he was willing to bear the entirety, that is to say 100% of the said 2 children’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I also took into account the fact that I had agreed with the Father than no maintenance was payable by him for the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> at this stage. However, I was aware that as the Parent with care and control of the said 2 children, there would be many daily miscellaneous expenses that the Mother would be incurring in her care of the said 2 children, on her current nett income of $2,000.00 per month less her own monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this regard, I was guided by the case of <b><em>AUA v ATZ <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a></em></b> [paragraph 41] wherein the Court of Appeal held that “<em>both Parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was also guided by the case of <b><em>BPC v BPB [2019] SGCA 03</em></b>, wherein the Court of Appeal held [at paragraph 111] that section 68 of the Woman’s Charter, does not mandate that each Parent should bear an equal share of the burden of providing maintenance for their children. The Court of Appeal said that “<em>We do not accept that s68 mandates such a result. Although Parents do indeed share an equal responsibility for looking after their children, this ought not to necessarily translate into each Parent bearing an equal share of the burden to provide maintenance for their children. This is because the extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors enumerated by s.114(1) of the Charter.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     On a balance of all the above factors, I was of the view that the Father should pay the sum of $3,000.00 per month based on my assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses of $1,525.00 for a 10-year-old (elder child) + $1,480.00 for a 7-year-old (younger child) = $3,005.00 rounded to $3,000.00 as fixed maintenance per month for the said 2 children. This was provided in Clause 1 of my Court Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In fact, my assessment of the elder child’s reasonable monthly expenses was less than what the Father himself accepted was reasonable at $1,758.48 plus reimbursements (see table at Paragraph 19 above). The same for the younger child, as the Father’s figure was at $1,557.48 plus reimbursements (see table at Paragraph 20 above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As for Clause 2 of my Court Order, after taking into account the Mother’s repeated concern that it was “impossible” to get reimbursement from the Father, balanced against the Father’s position that he needed proof or supporting documents for what he was paying for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>, I was of the view that a separate provision was required for the agreed enrichment activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> with proof of payment after. This was capped at the current amounts in the monthly sum of $1,511.00 as stated in Clause 2 of my Court Order. In this way, the Father was only obliged to pay for what had already been agreed upon and the Mother was only required to provide proof of payment to confirm what the Father had paid for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Therefore, the total monthly amount payable by the Father for the said 2 children’s monthly maintenance, was in the sum of $4,511 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> which, in my assessment, was at about 40% of his nett income and within his monthly disposable income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In Clause 3 of my Court Order, I also provided for the said 2 children’s other variable expenses in another separate provision on a reimbursement basis because these were ad hoc and not fixed monthly expenses.

If the applicant had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance. On the other hand, if the applicant had been able to manage with the pre-ordered maintenance, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for back-dating would be weaker</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The evidence showed that it was not disputed that the Father had been paying maintenance of over $2,000.00 per month for the said 2 children since January 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In addition, it was not disputed that from January 2023 to June 2023, the Father also paid what he called “a contribution” to the Mother in the sum of $500.00 per month because she was not working at the time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I noted that it was the Mother’s case that the Father had been solely bearing the family’s expenses prior to December 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> when the Parties separated. However, other than a bare assertion that she had to borrow money, which was at paragraphs 18 and 24 of Exhibit C (Mother’s Affidavit-In-Chief), there was no evidence to show what the Mother had to do to make up for the shortfall, if any, of the Mother’s and said 2 children’s expenses from January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My Decision on the Mother’s Case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Complainant Mother and the Respondent Father had entered into a consent order on all ancillary matters, which included an order for joint custody to the parties, sole care and control to the Complainant, and various maintenance obligations on the Respondent’s part, including the payment of their children’s childcare and school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In July 2023, the Complainant filed an enforcement application, claiming 3 months’ worth of preschool fees for C3 that the Respondent had refused to pay. After hearing the parties, I granted the Complainant’s application and ordered the Respondent to pay the full arrears of $4,547.43 claimed. The Respondent has since appealed. I now set out my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Complainant and the Respondent were married in October 2011. There are 3 children to the marriage, who were respectively 10, 8 and 4 years old at the time of the application. I refer to them in descending order of age as C1, C2 and C3 respectively (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Complainant and the Respondent attended mediation under the Family Dispute Resolution Division of the Family Justice Courts (“FDR Mediation”), where parties reached a global resolution of all ancillary matters. This was recorded as part of the interim judgment entered on 14 May 2019 (the “Consent Order”). Both parties were represented by counsel at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Consent Order provided that parties were to have joint custody of the Children, with sole care and control to the Complainant. The orders relating to the Children’s maintenance were set out at Clause 3(f) of the Consent Order, which reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The [Respondent] shall pay $3,000.00, being $1,000.00 for each child, as monthly maintenance for the Children with effect from the last day of May 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month into the [Complainant’s] designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In addition, the [Respondent] shall pay for the following expenses incurred by the Children directly to the third party or on a reimbursement basis to the [Complainant]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Childcare/student Care/school fees and all education expenses including school allowance, school bus, ad hoc school expenses, school uniform, stationeries, textbooks, tuition and enrichment classes and school trips;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Medical and dental expenses; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Insurance premiums for existing insurance policies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Provided that the [Complainant] moves into rented accommodation to stay with the Children, the [Respondent] shall pay an additional $1,000.00 per month towards the [Complainant’s] rental for accommodation pending the completion of the transfer/sale of the Matrimonial Home. The [Complainant] shall provide the tenancy agreement as proof of rental.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the time that the Consent Order was granted in May 2019, C3 was just under one year old. After the Complainant moved out of the matrimonial flat and into a rented apartment in Bedok North, she enrolled C2 and C3 into Sparkletots, with C2 in Kindergarten and C3 in infant care. C1 was already in primary school by then. This Sparkletots centre was situated at the ground floor of the block next to the Complainant’s apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Sometime in January 2022, the Complainant enrolled C3 into MindChamps Performing Arts International Preschool @Changi Business Park Pte Ltd (“MindChamps”), in anticipation of the Complainant’s move to her current residence at Bedok South. By this time, C2 had progressed to primary school. The preschool fees at MindChamps were about $1,600.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. These fees were deducted from C3’s Child Development Account (“CDA”) until the balance therein was insufficient to pay for any further fees. When this happened, the Complainant asked the Respondent to top up C3’s CDA for the purposes of paying C3’s fees at MindChamps. The Respondent refused to do so. The Complainant therefore took a loan from her parents to make payment of the outstanding fees of $4,547.43, being the fees owed to MindChamps for December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023. This is the amount that the Complainant claimed as the arrears she sought to enforce in this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The applicable legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Complainant’s enforcement application was made under Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “Charter”). Section 71 of the Charter sets out the court’s powers to make various orders in the event that a person fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       While Section 71 of the Charter itself does not provide for any statutory exceptions or mitigating circumstances under which the arrears claimed should not be enforced, it is well established that the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is the opportunity for the respondent to “show cause” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full or in part: <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> (“<em>Lai Ching Kin”</em>) at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Whether a respondent has “shown cause” or not is ultimately a fact-sensitive exercise. The touchstone of the inquiry is whether, given the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be inequitable to make an enforcement order or if doing so would lead to injustice: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> at [20]-[22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Complainant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant claimed that the Respondent was obliged to pay her the sum of $4,547.43, being C3’s MindChamps fees for November 2022, December 2022 and January 2023, in accordance with his obligations under Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order. The Complainant argues that the express terms of the order made the Respondent responsible for these preschool fees, without exception or restriction, and that the Respondent should therefore be held accountable as such.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In short, the Respondent refused to pay for C3’s fees at MindChamps because he had not consented to it. To his mind, there was no need for C3 to be enrolled into a preschool as expensive as MindChamps. C3, like C2, was previously enrolled at Sparkletots at Bedok North. The Respondent did not feel that children of C3’s age needed to attend “good schools”, and that money spent on a “good school” was not worth it, given C3’s young age<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent was of the view that C3 should have remained in Sparkletots.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Respondent accordingly proposed that C3 be transferred back to Sparkletots, in which case he would pay for C3’s Sparkletots fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Alternatively, if the Complainant wanted C3 to continue attending MindCamps, the Respondent said that he would contribute $750.00 per month, being what he estimated would be the cost of C3’s fees for his age group at Sparkletots<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. At the hearing on 30 October 2023, the Respondent clarified that his offer was to pay $750.00 per month for C3’s fees for the year 2022, and a reduced monthly amount of $150.00 for the fees in year 2023, being what he felt was the appropriate fee for the year given C3’s progression into Kindergarten 1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">On a plain reading of the order, is the Respondent required to pay for C3’s school fees?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As provided in Section 71 of the Charter, the court’s power to make an enforcement order is triggered when a person “fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order”. The first inquiry is therefore whether or not the Respondent was <em>required</em> to make the payment of $4,547.43 under the terms of the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To determine whether or not a payment is <em>required to be made under a maintenance order</em>, the starting point must be to examine the plain language of the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the outset, I note that the Respondent does not dispute that this clause could apply to C3’s preschool fees <em>generally</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>: the Respondent only disputes the Complainant’s <em>choice</em> of preschool, and would have had no qualms paying for C3’s preschool fees pursuant to this clause, if C3 had continued in Sparkletots instead. Indeed, Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order requires the Respondent to either pay directly or reimburse the Complainant for the Children’s “Childcare/student Care/school fees and all education expenses including school allowance, school bus, ad hoc school expenses, school uniform, stationeries, textbooks, tuition and enrichment classes and school trips”<em>.</em> From the inclusive and permissive language used, I infer that this intended to encompass all of the Children’s education-related expenses until the Children completed formal schooling. Even though this clause does not specifically state that “nursery”, or “kindergarten”, or “preschool” fees would be included, I find that the definition of “childcare” or “school” in this clause would be wide enough to encompass preschool fees. In any event, it was not disputed that this clause could apply to C3’s preschool fees:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Notwithstanding this, the Respondent does not believe that he is required to pay for C3’s preschool fees <em>at MindChamps</em>, primarily because the Complainant had enrolled C3 into MindChamps without his consent. The logical conclusion of the Respondent’s argument is this: if the Respondent was not <em>required</em> to make this payment under a maintenance order, then there are effectively no arrears to enforce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In <em>VCL v VCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23785-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 122</a> (“VCL v VCM”) (at [31]), the court held the view that where there was no express order stipulating that the paying party’s consent had to be obtained before he paid for certain expenses provided for in the maintenance order, “it would be untenable to adopt the position that there be consent – and express consent at that – on an intended course of action undertaken by a child, before a payer of maintenance pays anything”. The danger of adopting this position is that it “would create a perverse incentive for payers of maintenance to refuse blithely their consent on major decisions in a child’s life, in order to avoid paying the necessary and attendant expenses.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the facts, I find that there was no requirement for the Complainant to first obtain the Respondent’s consent before C3’s preschool fees at MindChamps could be payable. The wording of Clause 3(f)(b) of the Consent Order is clear and unambiguous. There is no express proviso stating that the Respondent’s obligation to pay for any of these specified expenses would be subject to the Complainant first seeking and obtaining the Respondent’s agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The agreement on the terms of the Consent Order was reached at FDR Mediation, where both parties were represented and had the benefit of legal advice. If there was any intention for the Respondent’s consent to have been sought first as a precondition before any of the expenses stipulated in Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order were incurred, this should have been expressly worded into the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Similarly, if there was any intention for C3 to be enrolled only into Sparkletots or another preschool in a similar, if not the same, cost bracket, this should also have been stipulated in the order. In this regard, I note that Clause 3(f)(b)(iii) of the Consent Order (which relates to the payment of the Children’s insurance premiums) expressly caveats that the Respondent would be responsible only for the premiums of <em>existing</em> insurance policies. This suggests that parties <em>were</em> aware of and <em>did</em> apply their minds to the option of inserting restrictions and limits into the wording of the clauses. To my mind, the inference that arises is that parties were therefore contented <em>not</em> to place any such restrictions on the other expenses listed, including that of the Children’s education expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore find, without difficulty, that on the plain reading of Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order, the Respondent was indeed required to pay for C3’s preschool fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Does the order for joint custody imply that the Complainant was required to obtain the Respondent’s consent before enrolling C3 into MindChamps? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Respondent nevertheless argued that because he was granted joint custody of the Children, he has a “50% stake in the decision-making process of the children.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> As such, the Complainant should not have enrolled C3 into MindChamps without his consent, even if the express terms of Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order did not specifically provide for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     However, on the facts of this case, I find that the order for joint custody does not stretch so far as to require the Respondent’s consent to C3’s enrolment into a preschool, and at least not to the extent where it would nullify his obligations under Clause 3(f)(b) of the Consent Order. I elaborate as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Court of Appeal in <em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (“<em>CX v CY</em>”) at [31] described “custody” as the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a “care and control” order. A “care and control” concerns the day-to-day decision-making of a child and dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. In contrast, residual “custody” concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The concepts of “custody” and “care and control” were more recently summarised in <em>VJM v VJL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26170-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 16</a> (“<em>VJM v VJL</em>”) at [18] as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our law adopts the legal constructs of ‘custody’, ‘care and control’ and ‘access’, which are used to support families in which the child’s parents have separated. As ‘custody’ refers to the decision-making authority and responsibility in major aspects of the child’s life, ‘custody’ is not directly dependent on having physical time with the child. In contrast, ‘care and control’ involves physical time with the child, caregiving, and the residence of the child with the parent as well as that parent’s decision-making responsibility over day-to-day matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In <em>CX v CY</em>, the Court of Appeal broadly observed (at [35]) that matters pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues were examples of the type of decisions that would generally be covered by a “custody” order. However, in my reading, one must be careful not to construe the Court of Appeal’s observations as a pronouncement that <em>every</em> decision relating to these issues must be made jointly (where a joint custody order is granted). Rather, the key inquiry is whether, to use the Court of Appeal’s words, the matter “would be considered [an] important and longer-term [decision] concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Parents routinely make a wide range of education-related decisions throughout their children’s lives. Some decisions will invariably be more significant and of greater consequence than others. Where an order for joint custody is granted, which is now the norm, it could be counter-productive to a child’s welfare if every education-related decision had to be made jointly. This is especially so where parties do not readily see eye-to-eye (which is not unusual between separated parents), or where an access parent who has minimal or irregular contact with the children is effectively given a veto on matters that would affect the children’s – and consequently the primary caregiver’s – day-to-day lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As such, it is natural that in a situation where a joint custody order is made with an order for sole care and control to a parent, that the care and control parent is trusted with the freedom to make various decisions, without the need to obtain the other parent’s consent. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s views at paragraph 30 of <em>CX v CY</em>, which left room for some education-related decisions to be made by the care and control parent (rather than necessarily jointly between parents with custodial rights), depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In other words, a “custody order” only gives the parent the residual right to decide on long-term matters affecting the child’s welfare. For instance, the right to decide on the type of education resides with the parent(s) with custody as it concerns the more important and long-term aspects of a child’s upbringing. The right to decide the particular school may also reside with the custodian(s) <b>depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education</b>.” [emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the present case, there was no dispute as to the <em>type</em> of education that C3 should receive at his age: both parties were agreed that C3 should be sent to a formal preschool, rather than other alternative forms of education such as homeschooling. Rather, the dispute at hand here was of the <em>choice</em> of preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my view, given the level of importance of choosing a child’s <em>preschool</em>, relative to the importance of choosing other institutions that the child may stand to be enrolled for in the future (for instance, for the child’s primary, secondary and tertiary education), this could conceivably be a decision left to be made by the parent with care and control. Unlike primary school education, which is mandatory for Singapore citizens under Section 3(1) of the Compulsory Education Act 2000, preschool education is completely optional. There are no formal examinations at preschool level, and how “well” a child “performs” at their preschool has no formal bearing on the child’s subsequent entry into his or her primary school. The selection of preschool, to put bluntly, is a decision of limited long-term academic impact on a child, relative to every other institution the child may subsequently be enrolled into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Furthermore, many parents, even in functional marriages, regard preschool as a form of childcare; a place to mind one’s children while they work. As such, besides choosing a preschool for reasons such as the types of activities offered, the teacher-to-child ratio, and the use of a bilingual curriculum, many parents also prioritise other practical factors such as proximity to their residence and their place(s) of work, and whether or not a preschool offers a full-day programme. These are factors that relate to the management of a child’s caregiving arrangements and day-to-day affairs, which fall within the scope of a care and control parent’s responsibilities as defined in <em>VJM v VJL</em>. This supports my view that once the decision to send C3 to preschool has been made by the parties, the <em>choice</em> of preschool could reasonably be left to the Complainant, being the care and control parent, to decide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     All things considered, I did not find the difference between preschools – in this case between Sparkletots and MindChamps, to be so significant and important to C3’s welfare as to fetter the Complainant’s prerogative as the care and control parent to decide where C3 should be enrolled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Having said this, I would caveat that my views as above should not be taken by the Complainant as a <em>carte blanche</em> to incur expenses in an uninhibited manner, or with disregard to the Respondent’s views. It remains open to the court hearing an enforcement application to decide that it would be unjust to enforce an expense that the Respondent was not at least consulted on, especially if the expense is a significant one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As referenced above, the court in <em>VCL v VCM</em> found that the payor’s consent was not a prerequisite to his obligation to pay for the necessary expenses where there was no express order to this effect. However, the court was also of the view that the payor should not be made to blindly pay for new or additional expenses he had not been informed of. To this end, the court highlighted the importance of <em>both parents</em> consulting and cooperating with each other, particularly on expected milestones (at [34]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Particularly where expected milestones such as primary school registration, graduation etcetera are concerned, an access parent should exercise initiative and broach the topic for discussion, and not always expect the care and control parent to approach him/her to consult him or her first. This is because the access parent is in no less a position than the care and control parent, to know when such major life events will be arising, and has an equal right to start the consultation process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Furthermore, a complainant’s <em>right</em> to incur various expenses is tempered by the expectation that such expenses must be reasonably incurred, or the complainant may find difficulty in enforcing the full sum claimed as arrears. To illustrate, a complainant may choose to spend an astronomical amount on expensive, branded stationery her children, and indeed she could be entitled to do so. However, the complainant’s expenditure may not necessarily be endorsed by the court should she seek to enforce the full cost of her luxurious spend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Ultimately, even where the arrears may be established and unarguable, a respondent will be given the opportunity during enforcement proceedings to show good cause why the arrears should not be enforced. In my view, the more <em>unreasonable</em> the expense incurred by a complainant, and the more <em>unreasonably</em> a complainant has conducted herself, the easier it may be for the respondent to show good cause for refusing to pay these arrears. At this juncture, I reiterate that the court will not compel a respondent to make payment where it would be inequitable for him to do so. In this vein, I proceed to examine if the Respondent in this case has shown good cause why the arrears of $4,547.43 should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Is there nevertheless any good cause why the arrears should not be enforced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To restate the court’s observations in <em>Lai Ching Kin</em> (at [10]), enforcement proceedings provide the respondent with an opportunity to “show reason” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full or in part. At the heart of this process is the desire to prevent injustice by ensuring that the maintenance orders are not “blindly enforced in the face of legitimate reasons for the failure of husbands and fathers to make payment.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     This being the Respondent’s opportunity to show cause, the burden of proof logically rests on him. In the present case, the Respondent’s chief argument is that C3 should have remained in Sparkletots, and not enrolled into MindChamps. The corollary of this is that the Complainant had therefore acted unreasonably in enrolling C3 into MindChamps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having considered the evidence and submissions, I find that the Respondent failed to sufficiently prove that the Complainant had acted so unreasonably, or that C3’s enrolment into MindChamps was so unreasonable, that it would be considered “good reason” for the Respondent to refuse payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41      <em>Firstly</em>, I accepted that the Complainant had legitimate reasons for enrolling C3 into MindChamps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Complainant’s reasons were, in summary, as follows. Although C3 (together with C2) used to attend Sparkletots near their previous residence at Bedok North, this was only a temporary arrangement and a function of where the Complainant was living at the time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> After C2 graduated, the Complainant was informed by Sparkletots that C3 had to be placed on a waiting list if he were to continue there because of the quota on the number of students progressing to the next level.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When the Complainant was about to move out of her rented apartment and into her current residence in Bedok South, she placed C3 on the waiting list of various schools which were more conveniently located for her, including a Sparkletots and a My First Skool. However, as only MindChamps was able to enrol C3 immediately, the Complainant proceeded to enrol him there so to avoid disrupting his education<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In any case, having observed C2’s struggles in keeping up with the curriculum in primary school after graduating from Sparkletots, the Complainant felt that MindChamps would better prepare C3 for primary school than Sparkletots would. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>Additionally, the Complainant’s change in residence meant a different route to her workplace, such that a switch to MindChamps (which was located along the way to her workplace) would save her about 15-20 minutes of travel time each way<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Respondent did not rebut the Complainant’s evidence at trial, nor did he offer any compelling reason to doubt the veracity of the Complainant’s evidence and her reasons. On the face of the evidence, I found the Complainant’s reasons to have been legitimate and mostly motivated by C3’s welfare, if not a function of the change in her living arrangements. There was no basis for me to find that this enrolment was done for an untoward parallel purpose, such as inflating the Respondent’s financial outlay. If the Complainant’s intention was simply to take advantage of the Respondent’s agreement to pay for the Children’s expenses pursuant to Clause 3(f)(b), the Complainant could have signed C3 up to a more expensive preschool or incurred a host of other expenses in the name of the Children’s “education” to claim the same from the Respondent. This was not the situation here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I also found that the Respondent’s objection to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps was premised less on C3’s interests, but more on his reluctance to pay the sums sought. The Respondent never offered any reasons as to why C3’s enrolment into MindChamps would be <em>contrary</em> to C3’s welfare. The Respondent in fact acknowledges that MindChamps is a good preschool, but simply posits that “children at his age… do not need to attend good schools” and that “money spent on a good school at that age is not worth it.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Respondent did not ask for C3 to be removed from MindChamps, nor has he taken out any application to that effect. It therefore appears to me that in terms of C3’s welfare and interests, the Respondent does not actually have any objections to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps. In my view, this diluted the strength of the Respondent’s reasons for refusing to consent to C3’s enrolment, and fortified the reasonableness of the Complainant’s decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45      <em>Secondly</em>, I find that the Complainant, on account of the Respondent’s conduct and acquiescence, had reason to believe that she could decide on C3’s preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     It does not escape me that the decision to enrol C3 into Sparkletots was one that was effectively made unilaterally by the Complainant in the first place. The Complainant had enrolled C2 and C3 into a Sparkletots centre that operated from the block next to her rented apartment at Bedok North, ostensibly choosing to do so out of convenience more than anything else as she needed somewhere nearby that had both infant care and childcare services. In the Respondent’s own words, “[the Complainant] moved out of her mum’s house so [C3] had to go somewhere and. I don’t know whose idea it was, but end up Sparkletots, I accepted it, you know.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Prior to this, C1 and C2 attended preschool at the Kindergarten at the Church of Holy Trinity in Tampines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, which was the church that the parties attended as a family. There was no evidence that the Respondent demanded that C3 similarly be enrolled in this church kindergarten, and by all accounts the Respondent was happy for C2 and C3 to be enrolled into Sparkletots and had no issues with the Complainant’s choice. In my view, this state of affairs gave the Complainant good reason to believe that the Respondent would have no issues with C3 unilaterally deciding on C3’s enrolment into MindChamps, given that he never raised any issue with her choosing to enrol C2 and C3 into Sparkletots previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the same vein, the Respondent never actually raised any objection to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps until he was asked by the Complainant to make monetary top-ups into C3’s CDA sometime in September 2022. By this time, C3 had already been enrolled in MindChamps for 9 months or so, having started in MindChamps in January 2022. The Respondent continued to have access to C3 throughout this period, and would have known of C3’s new enrolment if not through his conversations with C3, then from the very fact that C3 would show up for his weekday access with the Respondent in a MindChamps uniform<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> instead of a Sparkletots one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In <em>VCL v VCM</em>, the court espoused the importance of <em>both</em> parents communicating meaningfully, and emphasised the responsibility of the access parent to proactively communicate his or her views. I find the court’s observations to be apposite to the present situation, and I quote the salient portions in full for the benefit of the parties (at [33] and [35]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    All too often, the care and control parent is blamed – rightly or wrongly – for failing to inform the access parent of events and happenings in a child’s life. However, <b>where joint or no custody orders are concerned, it is clear to me that the responsibility for consulting and cooperation falls equally on both parents</b>. Of course as a matter of practical realities, the care and control parent would usually be the one keeping tabs of, and being the first to know of a child’s significant life events or milestones. <b>But being involved in a child’s life such that the joint custody order is meaningful and its purpose achieved, means that both parents are to be proactive, not just the care and control parent</b>. It cannot be the job of the latter to ensure that the access parent has perfect information on the major events of a child’s life – the access parent has to be responsible for seeking such information too. In fact, one may suggest that precisely because the access parent does not live with the child, it behoves him or her to actively engage the child or care and control parent on developments and updates in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35    In my view, <b>generally, once there has been communication to the access parent of an impending life event or milestone or decision to be taken, the burden is then on the access parent to respond to those communications and offer his or her views and input</b>. There is no need for the care and control parent to invite the access parent to proffer views – it is the entitlement of the latter and <b>he or she should exercise that right without need for solicitation.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Respondent does not dispute that the Complainant had asked him about enrolling C3 into MindChamps sometime in late 2021, before C3 was formally enrolled in January 2022. If the Respondent held strong objections to C3’s enrolment in MindChamps, he should have communicated this to the Complainant at the earliest possible juncture. The Respondent however chose to remain silent in a situation that warranted a clear and constructive response. The Respondent’s position was, in his own words, that “at no point did I give my agreement… which to me, means I disagree.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This, to me, is unsatisfactory. It does not behove him to sit on his hands when consulted about sending C3 to MindChamps, only to be up in arms when he is asked to make payment, especially where he would have been aware of his maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I therefore find in the circumstances that the Respondent had tacitly acquiesced to the Complainant enrolling C3 into MindChamps, and that in this context, the Complainant had not acted unreasonably in doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51      <em>Thirdly</em>, and relatedly, I find that the Respondent was not so proactive and communicative in discussing C3’s options in November 2022 (the month of the first MindChamps bill claimed as part of the Complainant’s arrears), that it would in the circumstances render it unreasonable for the Complainant to have continued with C3’s enrolment into MindChamps thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While the Respondent objected to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps once he was asked to pay for it, he never proposed any concrete, reasonable alternative, bearing in mind the reasons for switching C3’s preschool as explained by the Complainant. There is no evidence of any attempt by the Respondent to engage or address the Complainant on her concerns and reasons for the switch, apart from him making the sweeping statement (via text messages sent on 12 November 2022) that the quality of preschool education “makes no difference to [C3’s] development.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> When the Complainant expressly told him that she had already given him her reasons for enrolling C3 into this school, and that he therefore “cannot just say that it’s just all the same”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, the Respondent’s reply was brief and without elaboration: “U may feel that his new school is good but i don’t agree. I didn’t agree to mindchamps and u went ahead anyway”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Respondent’s bottom line appeared to be as communicated in his text message to the Complainant: “if u make decision urself, u have to deal with the consequences.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Respondent seemed most concerned about the limits of his liability, rather than with trying to do what he felt was truly best for C3, telling the Complainant “U always just spend my money like its free”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, and “since u made the decision urself, u have to pay for it.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     On the evidence, I find that the Respondent did not leave the Complainant with any options to consider besides re-enrolling C3 into Sparkletots or continuing with MindChamps with limited monetary contribution from him. The Respondent’s only other suggestion was for the Complainant to withdraw C1 and C2 from their after-school student care (which he had been paying for), which would save the Respondent an additional $500.00 per month which he could then divert toward C3’s MindChamp fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. This struck me as a facetious suggestion given that the Complainant was not able to make alternative childcare arrangements for C1 and C2, and given that Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order had expressly contemplated the need for student care services. It appeared to me that the Respondent simply did not want to increase his financial outlay. Further, despite the Respondent’s professed willingness to contribute $750.00 per month towards C3’s preschool fees, I note that the Respondent never voluntarily made any such payment to the Complainant at all, which, in my view, diminished the sincerity of the Respondent’s offer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. In this context, and given the Complainant’s reasons for withdrawing C3 from Sparkletots which were not rebutted by the Respondent, it cannot be said that the Complainant had acted unreasonably in continuing with C3’s enrolment in MindChamps from November 2022 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55      <em>Lastly</em>, I did not find the cost of C3’s fees at MindChamps to be so exorbitant as to be unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     It was not disputed that at or around the time the Consent Order was granted, C3 was enrolled into infant care at Sparkletots. This cost around $2,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>, which is about $400.00 more than C3’s average monthly fees at MindChamps. It is Respondent’s evidence that he paid this, without more, even though he felt, in his own words, that “it was quite a lot of money”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     With this in mind, I find it reasonable for the Complainant to have chosen to enrol C3 into a school that cost less than an amount that she knew the Respondent had previously paid. While I find that the sum of about $1,600.00 per month is objectively high, given that the Respondent had previously paid for a higher fee without issue, I do not find it unreasonable for the Complainant to have considered this to be beyond the scope of what the Respondent could pay, or what he may reasonably be expected to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I note that C3’s preschool fees for January 2022 to October 2022 had been paid for using C3’s CDA monies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, even though this was supposed to have been paid for by the Respondent. The Respondent had ostensibly benefitted from at least 9 months’ worth of non-payment, which even at the monthly fee of $750.00 he was willing to pay, would have amounted to $6,750.00 in savings and is exceeds the arrears claimed by the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     All things considered, I therefore did not find that the Complainant had acted unreasonably in enrolling C3 into MindChamps, and thereafter in continuing with C3’s education in MindChamps past November 2022. Consequently, I do not find any good cause why the arrears of $4,547.43 should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Having established the Respondent’s obligation to pay for the arrears, and given the Respondent’s candid admission that he has the ability to pay the amount of $4,547.43 in full<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, I so ordered that the Respondent pay to the Complainant the full sum of $4,547.43 by 15 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As costs follow the event, I also ordered costs fixed at $1,000.00 (all-in, including disbursements) payable by the Respondent to the Complainant, also by 15 November 2023. I made this order in consideration of the costs incurred by the Complainant in these proceedings including the costs of attendance at a half-day contested trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     For completeness, while the Complainant additionally sought an order for a banker’s guarantee, I declined to make such an order. I found that there was no need for it in the circumstances and noted that the Respondent had, to his credit, been faithfully making payment on the other aspects of the Consent Order that were not in dispute. As this was not appealed against, I do not elaborate any further on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It is unfortunate that much of the present dispute arose from a difference in parties' understanding as to the scope and application of the order for joint custody, which led to their inability to reach a consensus on how to deal with the payment of three months’ worth of preschool fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In delivering my oral judgment, I conveyed to the parties that an order for joint custody is more than just a veto that either party holds, but represents a commitment made by both parties to work proactively and collaboratively towards the interests of the Children. I hope that with better clarity on each party’s obligations as parents and as partners in this joint-parenting endeavour, and with a more charitable view of each other’s choices, further dispute can be avoided.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for hearing on 30 October 2023 (“NE”), p 25</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Respondent’s Affidavit dated 19 September 2023 (“RAEIC”), [6.1]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>RAEIC, [6.2.1]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>RAEIC, [6.2.2]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE, p 30-31</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE, p 28</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE, p 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“CAEIC”), [12], [14];

The family relocated in Singapore in 2016. The Husband held an Employment Pass while the Wife and children (18 and 14) were dependents under the Husband’s Employment Pass. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife applied against the Husband for maintenance for herself and her two children. At the conclusion of the hearing, I held largely in favour of the Wife, as the Husband’s evidence was bare and largely unsupported. The Husband has since filed an appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties were represented by counsel, who consented to have the hearing proceed in chambers without oral testimony and cross-examination. I note with disapproval the Husband’s filing of the reply affidavit and written submissions the day before the trial (26 December 2023) at 11.36pm, long after they were both due – the reply affidavit was due on 6 December 2023, while the submissions were due on 18 December 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Court was not informed, nor was leave sought, to file the reply affidavit and submissions out of time. This was regrettable. The affidavit was also filed in the form of a solicitor’s cover affidavit. As of the date of these written Grounds, the Husband has not filed his affidavit in the proper form.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Further, the reply affidavit contained mostly bare assertions, spanning over just four pages of substantive text. This was despite his counsel seeking leave to file a reply affidavit at the mention on 16 November 2023 on the basis that he would like to respond to the allegations in the Wife’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Thus, the Wife’s evidence was largely met with unhelpful bare denials.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I now turn to and briefly summarise the Wife’s evidence. In 2021, the Wife received letters from the Husband’s solicitors on the topic of divorce. However, the Husband continued to provide for the family. From early 2022, the Husband started to meet with the family again and returned home every week.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In 2023, the Husband’s lawyers wrote to Wife again on the topic of divorce. He limited communication with his family thereafter. From July 2023, the Husband stopped providing for the family. In the same month, he wrote to the Wife, stating that his salary was cut to $18,000 a month and that they had to return to India. He also terminated the rental agreement of the apartment where the Wife and the children lived. The Wife signed a fresh tenancy agreement so that she could continue to stay in the same apartment. In addition, in an email to the Wife, he wrote that the Wife’s and the children’s passes will be cancelled.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband also wrote to the school of the younger child to withdraw him on the basis that the child will be moving back to India. Similarly, the Wife wrote to the school separately, and successfully had the son re-enrolled.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife exhibited various correspondence in support of her evidence. This was in contrast to the Husband’s bare reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary objection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I turn to a preliminary objection. The Husband stated for the first time in his reply affidavit filed one day before trial that the marriage was void, and that on this basis, the Court could not make an order for maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, at the time of the hearing, the Husband had not initiated nullity proceedings, nor did he tender any evidence in these proceedings that the marriage was void. On these grounds alone, the preliminary objection could not stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       For completeness, I address the submission that the Court could not in principle make an order for maintenance. Counsel for the Husband cited <em>ADP v ADQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/65246-M.xml')\">[2009] SGDC 489</a> in support of this submission. That decision was however reversed by the Court of Appeal in <em>ADP v ADQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0143.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 143</a> (“<em>ADP v ADQ</em>”), where the Court held that it had the power to order the division of assets and maintenance in void marriages under Part 10 of the Women’s Charter 1961. It was of concern that a decision which was reversed on appeal was cited to me, with no reference to the appellate Court’s decision. For completeness, I note that <em>ADP v ADQ</em> was not a case like the present one where a spouse sought maintenance under Part 8 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to address this point given that the Husband had not even begun to prove that the marriage was void.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance of the Wife and Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     A complainant must first prove that the respondent has neglected to provide reasonable maintenance. The Court will also assess the quantum for maintenance, considering factors at s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Further, Professor Leong Wai Kum has written in <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>, LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, 2018 at paragraphs 12.111 and 12.113:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The author suggests that the maintenance of a wife during marriage should be appreciated as the provision of emergency financial help so that the goal in assessing her maintenance must be to ensure that her basic needs are met to the extent which the husband is able to meet them. The same must be true of maintenance of a child by her parent… The relationships… between the child and her parent… are continuing. Intervention by the court into such continuing relationships should be as minimally invasive as possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Such reported cases as there are demonstrate that the amounts ordered tend to be fairly modest. The courts use the law of maintenance to order the defendant to meet the child’s modest needs to the extent that she can…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     At the same time, the standard of living is relevant when the Court determines maintenance: s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Thus, what amounts to “basic needs” differs according to the standard of living of each family. The maintenance ordered does not need to be limited to basic sustenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Importantly, the Courts adopt a “budget” approach on a broad-brush basis when assessing maintenance: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29178-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 3</a> at [10], [30] and [31]. This is not an exercise in checking off receipts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Neglect</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s evidence that he had not paid maintenance since July 2023 was not disputed by the Husband. The Husband wrote in his reply affidavit:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">my change in circumstances since (i.e. a reduction in my fixed monthly salary) plus additional necessary expenses of rent, utilities, personal expenses, credit card repayments and taxes (as set out in pages 13 to 16 of my Respondent’s Bundle of Documents) do not allow me to continue maintaining the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As I had found that the Husband’s change in circumstances was self-induced (see immediately below), I found that the Husband had neglected to provide maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s income and earning capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     A key plank in the Husband’s case, apparent from above, was that he could no longer afford to pay maintenance because his income had been reduced to about $18,000 a month. His income tax Notices of Assessment of 2021 and 2022 stated that his annual income exceeded $1 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> However, no explanation was given at all as to why there was such a drastic drop in his income. The Wife’s undisputed evidence was that the Husband had deliberately changed employers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> At the hearing, his counsel confirmed that he had no instructions and that it was a “personal decision”. Since the Husband had not explained why he had chosen to take such a large pay-cut, I found that the reduction in income was self-induced. Thus, in determining reasonable maintenance, I took into account his previous salary. Indeed, a paying party’s earning capacity is relevant, as stated at s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s income and earning capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I also did not consider it reasonable for the Husband to expect the Wife to return to the job market quickly after being a housewife from 2005. His submission that the Wife was living off him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> was a plain attempt at minimising her non-financial contributions to the family, which the Courts have time and again disapproved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assessment of quantum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In assessing maintenance, I declined to consider the Husband’s proposal that the Wife and children move back to India. His case was that parties should move back to India because of his reduced earnings. Given that I had found that his reduction in income (even if true) was self-induced, I could not accept this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Counsel for the Wife confirmed that her client’s final lists of expenses were set out in her written submissions. She sought $9,900 for herself (including $3,600 for renting the apartment), $9,200 for her elder child (including $5,042 in school fees) and $11,500 for her younger child (including $5,800 in school fees), as well as specific reimbursement for expenses incurred for the family dog and for monies borrowed to meet expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Considering the principles set out above at [10] to [12] above, I found that the list of expenses the Wife had set out in her written submissions to be on the high side. For instance, $1,500 on grooming and spa and $750 on entertainment a month could not be said to be a sum that is necessarily to fulfil her basic needs. Similarly, it was not easy to see why it would be necessary for teenagers to spend about $1,000 each on clothing, personal grooming and entertainment, especially when a separate sum of $667 each had been set aside for dining out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In calculating maintenance, I also split the monthly rent of $3,600 between the Wife and the two children, as that reflected the sum each needed more accurately, given that they all stayed in the same household. I also took the view that it would be preferable for the school-related fees and expenses of the children to be borne on an ad-hoc basis, especially as the elder-daughter’s university arrangements appeared to be fluid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As stated at [12] above, a broad-brush approach would be appropriate. I also note that the Husband did not dispute each specific expense listed by the Wife, but made the broad point that he could not afford to pay because of his alleged reduced earnings. Hence, I do not propose to list down each specific expense. Bearing in mind everything above, including $1,200 each for rent, and applying a broad-brush approach, I ordered the Husband the pay the Wife monthly maintenance of $5,700 for herself and $4,200 each for the two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition, I ordered the Husband to pay:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     any school fees, tuition fees, fees associated with enrichment classes and co-curricular activities for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     one set of return economy class tickets to Canada annually on a full-service airline when the daughter starts school in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the son’s outstanding school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As alluded above, since many of the above expenses were ad-hoc, it would be more reasonable for the Husband to pay them as they were incurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I also backdated maintenance to July 2023 as the Husband did not dispute that he had failed to pay maintenance since July 2023. I did not think that the maintenance ordered, including backdated maintenance, was unreasonable given the Husband’s earning capacity. I did not provide separately for the Wife’s debts incurred for the purposes of providing for herself and the children, as I had already ordered backdated maintenance, and doing so would involve double-counting. I also did not provide separately for expenses relating to the family’s late pet dog, as the sum for backdated maintenance was already rather substantial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I ordered costs at $3,000 to be paid by the Husband to the Wife. This was on the low side given the Court attendances, affidavits and submissions filed, and the fact that the Wife was substantially granted what she had sought. Given the Husband’s conduct, especially his late filing of the reply affidavit and submissions, I was prepared to grant more.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s AEIC at paras 5 to 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 9 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Minute sheet of the mention on 16 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 17 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 33 to 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 47 to 49.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s reply affidavit at paras 5 to 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s reply affidavit at para 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s bundle of documents at pp 22 and 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s reply affidavit at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Wife’s written submissions at para 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Wife’s written submissions at paras 38 to 44.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Divorce","Women’s Charter","Leave to file writ of divorce notwithstanding that 3 years have not passed"],"date":"2024-02-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons 74/2023","title":"WTY v WTZ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 8","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31012-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lee Chay Pin (Chambers Law LLP) for the Husband","The Wife did not appear."],"timestamp":"2024-02-08T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheik Mustafa bin Abu Hassan","html":"<root><head><title>WTY v WTZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WTY <em>v</em> WTZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 8</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I heard the learned counsel for the Husband. I dismissed the application. The Husband filed an appeal. Here I give the reasons for my judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       This application was filed by the Husband in September 2023. The Husband and the Wife had married 6 months earlier, in March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       They have no children from the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband wished to have a divorce based on the unreasonable behaviour of the Wife. He listed the following facts in his proposed statement of particulars:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Sometime after the marriage was registered, the Husband and Wife’s families had dinner together. The Husband went to the Wife’s home. The Wife went straight into her bedroom, packed her clothes and informed the Husband that she had to return to Malaysia to meet suppliers. Although it is not clear from the statement of particulars, this appeared to have happened on the wedding night itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The Husband claimed that since then the Wife went to live a separate life from him in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. She did not divulge her location to the Husband. She claimed that she needed to rent the apartment there in order to regularly meet her suppliers in her ornamental fish business, and she wanted to avoid the traffic jam at the Causeway. Whenever she came to Singapore she would nevertheless return to Johor on the same day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     Before the marriage, the Wife had told the Husband that she wanted to have 2 children, a boy would be named G***, and a girl to be named S***. She told the Husband that she wanted to tattoo the names G***, S***, and the Husband’s name on her arms. However, the Husband discovered that the Wife got a tattoo of G*** only, and he also discovered that the Wife’s name was tattooed on the arm of another man, also named G***, whom the Wife claimed G*** to be a friend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     A few days after the wedding, the Husband discovered that the Wife was in a relationship with G***.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_v\"></a>(v)     The Husband’s sister-in-law was expecting a baby. The Wife obtained copies of the CT scan containing the baby. She sent it to G***’s wife. The Wife claimed that she was expecting a child by the Husband. The Wife told G***’s wife that the Husband was not ready to have a child, and that G*** was prepared to raise the child as his own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     The Husband confronted the Wife, and the latter claimed that it was all a misunderstanding. However, not long thereafter, the Husband discovered a post shared by G*** showing himself intimately with the Wife, titled “Happy Monthsary”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_vii\"></a>(vii)     The Wife admitted to committing adultery with G***.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_viii\"></a>(viii)    The Husband also relied on the Wife’s other conduct. He alleged that she showed up at his aunt’s funeral but refused to partake in funerary rituals. She spent the whole duration talking to G*** or texting him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ix\"></a>(ix)     The Wife requested the Husband to withdraw his name from their joint BTO application and allow G*** to take over instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_x\"></a>(x)     The Husband had to bear the pain of the Wife’s conduct and he was frequently questioned by his family members about the Wife’s whereabouts. He claimed that he was plagued and traumatised by thoughts of the Wife’s infidelity behind his back. He felt so stressed and sick that he vomited from the thought. His mental health was badly affected and he moved out of the Wife’s parents’ flat. He also claimed that the strain places him at risk of accident in his job as a ship operation executive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Based on the above, the Husband’s counsel argued that the Wife had acted in extreme depravity, and so divorce proceedings ought to be allowed to be instituted within the 3 year bar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 94 of the Women’s Charter provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">94.—(1)    No writ for divorce is to be filed in the court unless at the date of the filing of the writ 3 years have passed since the date of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court may, upon application being made in accordance with the Family Justice Rules made under section 139, allow a writ to be filed before 3 years have passed on the ground that the case is one of exceptional hardship suffered by the plaintiff or of exceptional depravity on the part of the defendant…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    In determining any application under this section for leave to file a writ before the expiration of 3 years from the date of the marriage, the court is to have regard to the interest of any child of the marriage and to the question whether there is reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To succeed in his application, the Husband must show either :</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_i\"></a>(i)     that he has suffered exceptional hardship or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     that the Wife committed exceptional depravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     He must also show that there is no reasonable probability of a reconciliation between him and the Wife before the expiration of the 3-year period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the case of <em>Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0195.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 195</a>, the High Court stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The statutory moratorium of three years is to impress upon married couples that marriage is not an event that one can sign in and out as they fancy. In the meantime, there are alternative remedies and relief in cases of abuse and they include applications for a personal protection order. The aggrieved party may also leave the other party, as this plaintiff has done. The moratorium is intended to hold out the hope of reconciliation – and who is to say that even in extreme cases of abuse, the abuser may not see the error of his or her ways and reconcile with the other?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In terms of evidence, the Husband files a singular piece of evidence: his proposed statement of claim and statement of particulars. He did not exhibit any documents to support or corroborate his allegations. I found it hard to accept that in this day and age, the Husband was not able to adduce any of the texts or the postings that he referred to. This left his case at the status of a bare allegation. Nevertheless, I was conscious that I could not at this stage decide whether the allegations are true. However, it did not mean that I was to accept the evidence uncritically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     With this in mind, I found that the Husband had not shown that his case, even if true, had attained the level of exceptional hardship. This does not deny that, prima facie, he may have sufficient grounds to obtain a divorce based on unreasonable behaviour of the Wife. However, section 94 expressly requires the hardship to be of an exceptional degree. I find that the Husband has failed to show this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Similarly, I found that the Husband failed to show that the Wife committed exceptional depravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I also found that the Husband failed to show that there was no reasonable probability of reconciliation between the Husband and the Wife. The marriage is less than a year old. The parties are in Singapore or Johor Bahru. This fact alone distinguished this case from the facts in <em>Ng Kee Shee v Fu Gaofei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48932-M.xml')\">[2005] SGHC 171</a>, where the High Court held that there was nothing left to reconcile in that case because the Wife had deserted the Husband and returned to China after repeatedly avowing never to return. I found that the facts of the present case were closer to those in of <em>Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence</em> instead, and that there remained, however residual or unlikely, a probability of reconciliation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In view of the above, I could only conclude that the Husband did not show that he suffered from exceptional hardship, nor that the Wife had committed exceptional depravity, nor that there was no reasonable probability of reconciliation. I therefore dismissed the application.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of Maintenance for Child – Variation of Division of Assets"],"date":"2024-01-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2465 of 2021 (Summons No 966 of 2023)","title":"WSG v WSF","citation":"[2024] SGFC 7","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30975-SSP.xml","counsel":["David Nayar (David Nayar and Associates) for the Plaintiff","Michelle Elizabeth Woodworth, Yap Tong, Hitomi (Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-02-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>WSG v WSF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WSG <em>v</em> WSF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30975-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 7</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2465 of 2021 (Summons No 966 of 2023)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 January 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kenneth Yap </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> David Nayar (David Nayar and Associates) for the Plaintiff; Michelle Elizabeth Woodworth, Yap Tong, Hitomi (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the Defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WSG — WSF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of Maintenance for Child</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of Division of Assets</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 January 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff in this case (hereinafter referred to as the Mother) sought to enforce maintenance arrears against the Defendant (hereinafter referred to as the Father) in MSS 659/2023. In response, the Father filed FC/SUM 996/2023 for a downward variation of child maintenance and mortgage payments under the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both applications were consolidated to be heard together, with the Father’s application for variation proceeding first. In his application, the Father sought a reduction of his monthly payments from $10,700.00 to $1,000.00. On 4 October 2023, I allowed the variation in part, reducing the total monthly quantum payable by the Father from $10,700.00 to $8,800.00. Parties were then given time to consider amicable resolution of the Mother’s enforcement application in MSS 659/2023. As they were unable to resolve matters, the variation decision was finalised on 17 October 2023 with costs of $2,000.00 (all-in) awarded in favour of the Mother. The Mother’s enforcement application proceeded to trial thereafter and is still ongoing at the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Dissatisfied with the outcome of his application, the Father filed the present appeal against the variation order on 26 October 2023. I had earlier provided the parties with brief grounds on 4 October 2023. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties were married on 8 August 2011. Ten years later, the Mother filed for divorce on 21 May 2021. Parties agreed to settle, and Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was entered into by consent on 14 July 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There is one child of the marriage, aged 11 years and attending Primary 5 at the time of hearing (henceforth referred to as “the Child”). The Father has two other children: an 18 year old son from his first marriage (“Child B”), and a 2 year old daughter (“Child C”) born outside of wedlock in June 2021. The Mother does not have any other children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As part of the divorce proceedings, the parties reached an agreement on ancillary matters. Interim Judgment was entered into by consent on 14 July 2021 and judgment was made final on 18 October 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Under Order 3(a) of the IJ, the parties were granted joint custody, with shared care and control of the Child. Although the IJ specifies that the Child would be under the Mother’s care from Sunday 8.00 pm to Friday 8.00 pm, and under the Father’s care from Friday 8.00 pm to Sunday 8.00, in practice, parties resided in the same household after divorce until an incident on 30 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The relevant financial terms of the IJ are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Order 3(c)(a):</b> The Mother retains all rights, title and interest in the Scotts Property and the Father waives all rights and claims to the same, provided that he “shall be entitled to reside at the Scotts Property for as long as he wishes until the property is sold”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Order 3(c)(b):</b> For as long as Child A is attending his present primary school, the Mother shall not sell the Scotts Property without the Father’s express consent. Upon the sale of the Scotts Property, the Mother shall use the sale proceeds of the Scotts Property for the sole purpose of purchasing another property in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Order 3(c)(c):</b> Once the Child completes his education at his present primary school, the Mother would be at liberty to rent out the Scotts Property. She would not need the Father’s consent to sell the Scotts Property.

Scotts Property, until the occurrence of an unfortunate incident on 30 March 2022. On that evening, the Mother had brought her friend, a gym instructor, to the master bedroom of the Scotts Property. The Father returned and discovered the gym instructor disrobed in the Mother’s bedroom. An altercation ensued, which ended with the Father hitting the gym instructor on the head with a wine bottle. The police were called and the Father was arrested. After the Father’s arrest, the Mother changed the lock to the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022. The Father was not able to reside at the Scotts Property thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Arising from the incident, the Father was charged and convicted with a criminal offence, and was sentenced to serve a short detention order.

obligations was premised on two grounds. First, he claimed that there was a material change in circumstances due to an increase in expenses that had resulted in his total outgoings exceeding his income (“the First Ground”). Secondly, he sought to rely on his eviction from the Scotts Property on 30 March 2022 as a material change that justified a rescission of his obligation to pay $5,700 towards the mortgage and MCST fees (“the Second Ground”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     With respect to the Father’s First Ground, the gist of his arguments were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There had been an increase in his expenses of $18,465.50 arising from (i) increased mortgage financing for his Marina Way Property held in his sole name, (ii) payment of rental for an alternative residence following his eviction from the Scotts Property, (iii) a rise in property tax for the Marina Way Property, and (iv) the need to make maintenance payments for the Child following the depletion of the ring-fenced funds. These components collectively amounted to $27,507.50<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, and with his other monthly expenses amounting to $6,607.15, as well as personal monthly expenses of $3,050 per month, far exceeded his salary of $8,000.00 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There had been an increase in his expenses in relation to the Father’s children outside of the marriage. The Father attributed the increase to (i) his obligation under a Consent Order entered on 18 November 2022 with his former wife to fully pay for Child B’s university education in Australia, the costs of which amounted to $$4,446.00 each month, and (ii) an increase in Child C’s expenses by about $1,000 each month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While the Father’s income had increased from $10,400.00 at the time of the IJ to $16,097.00 at present, the Mother’s income had increased more substantially from $8,000.00 to $15,000.00 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There has been a depletion of the Father’s savings because of an investment-related fraud by a Maybank remisier, which resulted in a loss to the Father of USD $1,200,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In addition, the Father submits that the maintenance sum of $5,000.00 for the Child is not justified, and he estimates that schooling, tuition and food costs for the Child only amount to $2,044.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     With respect to the Second Ground, the Father submits that his eviction from the Scotts Property amounted to a radical and material change in circumstances which released him from his obligation to contribute $5,700 towards the mortgage every month. He objected to the characterisation of this sum as part of child maintenance, and emphasised that his obligation under the IJ was to pay this sum only if the Scotts Property was not rented out or sold.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s Submissions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother took the position that the Consent Order was crafted to safeguard the living arrangements for the Child near his present school, and that the residence of the Father at the Scotts Property was therefore irrelevant. She submits that the component of $5,700 is for the Child’s housing needs, and formed part of the Father’s agreed maintenance obligations towards the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. They should not therefore be varied as there was no change to the needs of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In response to the Father’s assertion that his financial standing had changed adversely, the Mother advanced the following arguments:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s expenses were already far more than this alleged income at the time of the Consent Order and his lifestyle and spending habits suggest that he is not in financial difficulty. Notably, at the time of the IJ, the Father’s alleged total monthly expenses of $22,124.20 were already more than twice his income of $10,400.

In this regard, sections 118 and 119 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provide as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary orders for maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>118</b>.    The court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance… on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made … where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreements for maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>119</b>.    Subject to section 116, the court may at any time and from time to time vary the terms of any agreement as to maintenance made between Father and wife … where it is satisfied that there has been any material change in the circumstances and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any such agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Section 127 of the Women’s Charter further provides that Parts 8 and 9 of the Women’s Charter apply, with the necessary modifications, to a maintenance order for children made pursuant to divorce proceedings. This requires the Court to consider the following two provisions under Part 8 relating to spousal and child maintenance. First, section 72(1) gives the Court the power to vary or rescind any maintenance order, provides further elucidation for the test for variation as set out in s118:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Rescission and variation of order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and <b><em>on proof of a change in the circumstances</em></b> of that person, his wife or child, or for <b><em>other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</em></b>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit. <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Next, section 73 emphasises that any variation of child maintenance must be reasonable and must be in the welfare of the child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreement for maintenance of child</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>73</b>.    The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child … notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The power to vary an order relating to division of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The power of the Court to vary an order relating to the division of assets is found in section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>112.</b>—(1)    The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a>, it was noted by the Court of Appeal that at [24] that “the invocation of s 112(4) is justified where a court order is unworkable to begin with, or has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances which have arisen”. Such new circumstances would have to change the situation such that the implementation of the order is radically different from what was intended, at [25]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We are of the view that where new circumstances have emerged since the order was made which so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which is radically different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability, and the court would make, inter alia, the necessary variations to deal with such unworkability…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     One significant difference between the variation of an order relating to division of assets as opposed to child maintenance is that in the latter, regard should be had to the welfare of the child when considering issues in relation to maintenance. This was underscored by the Court of Appeal in <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a>, at [48]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the court is considering the issue of division of assets, the focus is on the <em>proprietary entitlements</em> of the parties to the marriage <em>inter se</em>. No interests of third parties like children are at stake. It therefore stands to reason that any agreement which has been freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties upon legal advice should be almost determinative of the outcome and the role of the court is greatly circumscribed: it is there only to ensure that the agreement would not effect injustice. In contrast, where the court is considering the issue of maintenance for the child, the focus of the court’s inquiry is the <em>financial needs</em> of the child – a <em>third party</em> who had no say in the conclusion of the agreement but whose interests are nevertheless directly implicated. In this context, the court assumes a more prominent custodial role and the overriding objective is that the welfare of the child must be safeguarded and adequate provision must be made for his/her upkeep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant factors in considering whether a material change justifies a variation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Two further observations are apposite when the Court considers whether to vary the orders relating to maintenance or division of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The first is that the courts generally attach significant weight to an agreement relating to financial matters in a divorce. In <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19150-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 41</a>, Chao Hick Tin JA noted at [31] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is a matter of common sense and justice that the existence of an agreement for the division of matrimonial assets in contemplation of divorce should be accorded due weight when the court decides what is a just and equitable distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">His Honour went on to observe, at [32], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Simply put, if parties have reached an agreement on division which they have <em>freely and advisedly entered into</em>, then it is surely “just and equitable” that the terms of this agreement are adhered to. We recognise that the distributions accepted in a postnuptial agreement will not necessarily reflect what the parties would have received had they gone to court for adjudication. However, this can hardly be surprising. All settlement agreements, no less marital agreements, are a product of compromise. The distributions entered into reflect the benefits, both tangible (in terms of saved legal costs) and intangible (the psychological value of repose), of dispute avoidance. Parties often accept less than what they would otherwise properly be entitled to in order to find closure. This is entirely understandable, and it is also to be expected and respected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the context of agreements on maintenance, the court would also be circumspect in varying an order reached by consent, as parties are in the best position to appreciate their own financial circumstances, and may have made compromises or concessions that were pre-conditions to settlement. This was observed by the court in <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<em>UNC</em>”) at [24(b) – (e)]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    In this regard, agreements for maintenance are different from general orders for maintenance as the terms reached were those constructed by the parties themselves. The parties are in the best position to appreciate their own circumstances, and to decide what allowances or concessions to make.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Given their special position, the proposals and agreements they make carries with it a <em>greater legitimate expectation</em> that they would be fulfilled. It is for this reason why the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a>, in the context of varying of consent orders relating to matrimonial assets, stated (at [25]) that any new circumstances must “radically change” the original intent of the order for it to be aried. This underscores the seriousness the courts place in agreements reached between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    In the premises, parties are, in my view, expected to ensure that they have done the necessary due diligence to ensure a reasonable level of robustness to their promises…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)    Accordingly, if a party had constructed the agreement such that he or she were placed in a situation where any change would affect the ability to satisfy the terms of the agreement, this Court should be more circumspect in granting the variation sough after. A party who knowingly enters into a bad or unsustainable bargain cannot subsequently seek refuge from this Court to seek absolution for their own failures. To allow this would make a mockery of parties’ legitimate interests in reaching an amicable resolution of their disputes. It would also devalue the oft-overlooked fact that their agreement has now been clothed with the stature and force of a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The second observation I would make is that foreseeable and/or self-induced changes of circumstance would not provide sufficient justification for variation. In the Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore (Foo Siew Fong gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia 2016) (“Law and Practice”), it was noted at [7.4.35] that parties cannot rely on foreseeable changes of circumstance to justify variation of an agreement:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">What constitutes material change justifying a variation of an agreement for maintenance necessitates a comparison of the present circumstances of the parties with the circumstances when they entered in the agreement. Where an <b>upcoming material change was expected to happen and known to the parties at the time of making the agreement</b>, the party agreeing to pay cannot make use of such a change in circumstances to later seek variation of the maintenance agreement. [<em>Emphasis added</em>].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Where the material change is self-induced, a variation would similarly be disallowed. In the Court of Appeal decision of <em>CDV v CDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25101-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 100</a>, Steven Chong JA noted at [88] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of an application to vary a maintenance order, it is well established that a variation will be disallowed if the adverse change is circumstances is self-induced (see, for example, <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> at [24]; <em>VCF v VCG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23778-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 120</a> at [58]; and <em>UWY v UWZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23246-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 60</a> at [22]). It seems to us that there is no reason why this principle should not apply in a similar manner in the context of an application to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets. Where the order becomes unworkable due to a self-induced change in circumstances, the court should not permit a variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In a similar vein, it was pointed out in <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<b><em>UNC</em></b>”) at [23] that “if a change was foreseeable or self-induced, this would not justify a variation”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In essence, it can be discerned that for a variation of maintenance to be granted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant cannot rely on a circumstance or fact that existed at the time the agreement was constructed between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the change relied upon was foreseeable or self-induced, it would not justify a variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant has to prove a change in the circumstances that is “material” and in the context of any variation of the maintenance of a child, it has to be reasonable and in the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Bearing in mind the parties’ positions and the relevant law, I considered the following issues in arriving at my decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Father’s financial situation presents a material a change of circumstances that warrants a downward variation from the monthly child maintenance of $5,000.00;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Father’s eviction from the Scotts Property constitutes a material of change in circumstance that justifies a downward variation of the monthly mortgage payment and MCST fee of $5,700.00; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether any downward variation should be backdated to May 2022, which is the first date of default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Whether the change in the Father’s financial position constitutes a material change in circumstances that justifies a variation of the child maintenance orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Having reviewed the evidence and submissions, I disagreed with the Father’s First Ground that the rise in his expenses justified a downward revision of his monthly payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The first observation I would make is that the Father’s net income had risen since the IJ. The Father had two sources of income, being salary from TFP, which had risen from $4,000.00 to $8,000.00 over the material period, and rental returns from his Marina Way Property. With regard to the latter, while mortgage repayments had risen amidst higher interest rates, this was mitigated by a corresponding rise in rental. From the table below, it can be seen the Father saw an increase of $3,3134.50 in his net income, from $1,358.00 at the point of the IJ to $4,492.50 at present:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"21.5756848630274%\"><col width=\"25.0949810037992%\"><col width=\"23.995200959808%\"><col width=\"29.3341331733653%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>At the time of the Consent Order</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Current</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Income</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Salary</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4,000.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$8,000.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Rental Income </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$6,400.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$9,300.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expenses</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mortgage, Marina Way (H’s sole property)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$8,642.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$12,133.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tenanted Periods: </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">27 March 2021 – 26 March 2023; 14 April 2023 – current</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Property Tax</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$400</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$674.50</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Net income</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,358.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4,492.50</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Increase of $3,134.50</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is trite that a material change in expenses <em>per se</em> would not be sufficient to warrant a variation if the applicant has seen a corresponding rise in income. In the Court of Appeal case of <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a>, the father in that case had sought to reduce child maintenance on the basis that educational expenses borne by him had increased significantly following the children’s relocation to the U.K. In declining the variation, Steven Chong JA observed, at [14] and [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.    First, in examining the question of material change in circumstances, the inquiry is not simply whether there has been any material change <em>per se</em> since the Maintenance Order. The change must be sufficiently <em>material</em> such that it is no longer fair to expect the <em>status quo</em> to remain… Here, there is no dispute that the Father’s increase in income significantly outstrips the increase in the children’s educational expenses … No suggestion has been made that the Father is unable to afford the increase in the educational expense and indeed the evidence militates against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15.    Second, the increase in the children’s educational expenses cannot be said to be unforeseeable… The Father must therefore have foreseen that he would have to find means of independently financing the increased educational expenses resulting from the children’s move. There is also no suggestion that the children moving to the UK to pursue their studies was an unexpected and sudden decision. Accordingly, we do not consider the increased educational expenses to constitute a material change of the circumstances under s 118 of the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On the present facts, the phenomenon of an interest rate hike should have been reasonably foreseeable to any property investor. It was incumbent upon the Father to have made provision for such fluctuation, before agreeing to the terms of the consent judgment. In any case, the change was not material as the rise in his income could clearly cover the increased monthly outflow occasioned by the retention of the Marina Way Property. There was therefore no change in circumstance that was sufficiently material to expect a change of the status quo. I would venture to add that, even if the Father had experienced a net loss, there was no explanation as to why he could not sell this non-performing asset in order to reduce his monthly outflow.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn next to consider the increase in maintenance obligations towards Child B and Child C. With regard to Child B, the Father’s maintenance obligations were increased from $1,250.00 per month to $4,446.00, on account of the Father agreeing to a consent judgment dated 18 November 2022 in proceedings brought by his ex-wife to render him solely responsible for cost of university education for Child B in Australia. The Mother argues that this increase is voluntary and self-induced, and was unfair because it apportioned resources to child B even though the Father had been in arrears of his payment obligations for five months at that point. To be fair to the Father, I would not consider the increased expenditure to be self-induced simply because it arose from a consent judgment. By the Father’s explanation, Child B needed to take up overseas education as he was struggling academically at junior college. Nevertheless, I noted that this change of circumstance was foreseeable and could not for that reason justify a variation. Child B was nearly 17 years of age at the point where parties entered into the IJ by consent on 14 July 2021. The need for overseas education would have been foreseeable at that point, and the Father should have provisioned for this accordingly. I would therefore not consider Child B’s university expenses to be sufficiently material to justify a variation for the purposes of s 118 of the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As for Child C, the Father submits that there is a monthly increase of $400 in paediatric costs and $600 in miscellaneous costs for the upkeep of the child. I note that Child C was born in June 2021, one month before the IJ was entered into. Any normal and reasonable costs in relation to the bringing up of a toddler would have been completely foreseeable at that point. The Father has not shown that the costs currently incurred by Child C are in any way unusual or unexpected. These costs likewise cannot justify a downward variation of maintenance for the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I would add that even if expenses had risen for the Father’s other children such that there was a need for financial belt tightening, there was no reason why such austerity should be visited only on the Child of this marriage. It is incumbent upon the Father to manage and balance his obligations towards all his children equally and fairly, and not allocate sacrifices arbitrarily to any particular child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The third change of circumstance the Father seeks to rely on is a depletion of his savings. It was submitted by Counsel for the Father that the Father’s expenses stood at a sum of $46,035.23, far exceeding his disclosed monthly income of $16,097.00, resulting in a monthly deficit of $29,938.23<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. The Father also highlights that his financial position has suffered greatly due to a loss of USD 1,200,000.00 which he suffered due to a fraud perpetrated by his Maybank remisier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I disagreed with the Father’s characterisation that his savings had been depleted for several reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     First, it was clear that he had entered into the IJ on the basis that he would be drawing down on his savings rather than relying on his income to meet his payment obligations. The fact that, following the depletion of the ringfenced sum, he is now out of pocket on a monthly basis cannot <em>ipso facto</em> mean that he is facing financial difficulty. It is incumbent upon the Father to be prudent in financial planning to ensure that he retains sufficient savings to make good on the agreed payments when they materialise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Indeed, as earlier cited, it is clear that a party who “knowingly enters into a bad or unsustainable bargain cannot subsequently seek refuge from (the) Court to seek absolution from their own failures”: see <em>UNC</em> at [24(e)]. Where parties have voluntarily entered into an agreement following negotiations, it is reasonable to assume that the terms entail a reasonable level of contemplation and sustainability. The Court should be wary to disturb the sanctity of such agreement, save where the change in circumstances is not reasonably foreseeable <em>and</em> fidelity to the terms presents a radical departure to the financial standing of the applicant. Hence, on the facts of <em>UNC</em>, the court held that the father who entered into a consent order to pay maintenance and relied on his savings to fund such payments could not later rely on the depletion of those savings as a material change of circumstance, at [27]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In this regard, I was of the view that the depletion of the sale proceeds was not a material change in circumstance at the time he made the agreement to the present time. On the plaintiff’s own miscalculations, he was already dipping into the sale proceeds <em>before any change to his salary</em>. In other words, the depletion was not directly linked to the plaintiff’s reduction in salary. The depletion of the sale proceeds was not an event which the plaintiff could not have foreseen. On the contrary, the plaintiff knew or would have known that the depletion of sale proceeds was a real eventuality in the future. The fact that the plaintiff was required to dip into the sale proceeds at the outset underscored the unsustainability of his agreement under the IJ, and his financial management as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Second, the Father’s total asset worth is not entirely clear and it is therefore difficult to conclude that his asset base is near depletion. He was by all accounts a successful businessman and had on 3 March 2020 sold the shares in his company, TPL to Under Armour Europe B.V., for which he received approximately US$5,600.000 (equivalent to about S$8,000,000). In his reply affidavit, the Father accounted for these funds as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had invested the proceeds in businesses that the Mother runs, with all proceeds debited into his Singapore UOB account;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had bought the Mother gifts over the years;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Investments were made toward the end of 2020 and the restaurant business that the Mother now runs began operations in December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Prior to the sale of the business, the father had transferred money to the Mother to buy a property in Shanghai, and had transferred other assets to her and made monthly payments to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     These responses lack specificity, and no documentary evidence was provided to trace the whereabouts of the $8 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. At the hearing, the Father’s counsel sought leave to file a further affidavit to address this issue, but this was declined as the hearing had already proceeded in earnest and in my view, the Father should have taken the opportunity early on to respond to and clarify this averment in his reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I would add that the Mother had requested that the Court draw an adverse inference for the Father’s failure to provide full and frank disclosure in relation to the proceeds of the sale of TPL. I declined to go to such an extent, because no discovery application had been filed by the Mother following voluntary disclosure by the Father. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the Father had done himself no favours by failing to fully account how he had managed to deplete the S$8 million over a period of about two years from the receipt of the funds in March 2020 to May 2022, when he first started to default on payments. The evidential burden lies with the Father to demonstrate how such a substantial sum of money was no longer available, and the lack of a satisfactory explanation casts significant doubt on his claim that his savings had been depleted by the time of the variation application on 29 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Further, it appears that the Father has other assets that can be applied towards his payment obligations. He owns 45% of the shares in TFP and is in the board of directors of TFP<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. He is also a director of EUTSPL, a company incorporated following the Consent Order, in which he is a 51% shareholder<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. There is no satisfactory explanation of why the Father considers himself to be impecunious despite his substantial shareholdings in both companies, which are going concerns. Turning to other assets, the Father could also choose to liquidate the Marina Way Property in order to improve liquidity until his business fortunes improve. He also owns other valuable assets, in the form of three motor vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Coupe and Harley Davidson Roadster, which are fully paid up<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, and a Mercedes-Benz E200 AMG Line, which has an outstanding loan of $74,704.00.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> There is no indication why any of these assets could not be sold to cover the increased expenses faced by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Third, I turn to the Father’s reliance on his loss to a fraudulent trader in the sum of USD 1.2 million as a reason for his financial difficulties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. While this was an unfortunate incident, it should be remembered that an investor incurs risk for return and must perform the necessary due diligence to safeguard his investment. The Father had acted on his own volition by choosing to invest in products purportedly offered by the remisier. It would be inequitable for him to now evade his obligations under the IJ to cover his incurred losses. Further, given that there are gaps in the asset position of the Father, it is difficult to ascertain the precise impact that the fraud had on his overall financial standing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Fourth, I find the Father’s spending patterns to be in conflict with his purported impecuniosity. A snapshot of his personal expenses on a single credit card in the month of November 2022 shows that he had spent $39,626.61 on food and beverage, entertainment and luxury items in the month of November 2022 alone, despite having been in arrears since May 2020. The extracted entries from his credit card is tabulated as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\"

This list of transactions is non-exhaustive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Apart from the above, other personal expenses by the Father include the purchase of wine as a gift at the 1855 The Bottle Shop, Singapore on 24 January 2023, amounting to $653.00 on 24 January 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. He had also purchased three gift watches worth $9,650.00, $12,040.00 and $7,900 on 11 November 2022, 19 November 2022 and 22 April 2023 respectively. In his reply to interrogatories, the Father confirmed that one watch was purchased on behalf of a friend from Malaysia, one watch was a gift to his ex-staff, and another was purchased for his own investment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. The Father has also clarified that he had made a purchase of a limited-edition whisky for a sum of $125,000.00 as an investment on behalf of EUTSPL, by taking out a shareholder’s loan<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is particularly telling that the Father had seen fit to spend large sums on luxury items, entertainment and gifts, while claiming that his savings had been depleted by increasing expenditure and his loss to fraud of USD 1.2 million. Taken in totality, I find that the Father’s spending habits and lifestyle patterns are not those of somebody who was as impecunious as he claimed to be (see in this regard, <em>TOF v TOE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26792-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 2 SLR 976</a>, at [55]). For this reason, I do not consider there to be any material change due to depleted savings that would justify downward revision. I further did not find any reason to doubt that the continued payment of $5,000.00 in child maintenance would be to the benefit of the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     At this point, I would add a footnote to address the Father’s argument that his contributions be reduced on account of the Mother’s income having increased from $8,000.00 to $15,000.00 per month. To my mind, the Father’s level of discretionary expenditure revealed above clearly puts paid to this argument. If he can spend nearly $40,000 in one month on luxuries and entertainment, then it cannot lie in his mouth to require the Mother to shoulder a greater share of the maintenance and mortgage sums in his stead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I accordingly found the Father’s First Ground that there was a shortfall between his expenses and income due to rising expenses to be insufficient to reduce his maintenance payments. The Father still possesses considerable resources, and has yet to demonstrate that his cash and assets had depleted to such an extent that it would be inequitable for him to continue his monthly payments. To succeed in this or any subsequent variation application, the Father has to show that his resources are exhausted to the point that it is inequitable to expect him to honour his obligations under the agreed terms of the IJ. He cannot, merely two years after the consent judgment, expect the Mother to share his financial burdens for the sole purpose of preserving his current asset base.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Whether the Father’s eviction from the Scotts Property constitutes a material change in circumstances that justifies a variation of the mortgage payments </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Turning to the Father’s Second Ground, I did find greater traction with his argument that his eviction from the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022 justified a reduction of the mortgage payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Father was effectively denied his licence to stay at the premises when the Mother changed the locks to the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022. This was a breach of the terms of Order 3(c)(a) of the IJ, and I did not find it to be justified on the basis of safety considerations. While the Father’s initial reaction in the altercation was wrong, he had been convicted of a criminal charge and had paid the price for his actions. I did not see that that his singular action necessitated a complete eviction from the property. Parties were still on talking terms thereafter and could have established the necessary boundaries that were required for divorced partners to stay under the same roof for the sake of the child. For example, a clear demarcation of living areas and the installation of room locks could have ensured that proper boundaries would be observed between the parties. I also note that the Mother did not see fit to apply for a personal protection order against the Father in the aftermath of the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It follows that I do not accept the Mother’s argument that the Father’s eviction was self-induced, i.e. that his eviction was necessitated by his behaviour on the evening of 30 March 2022. The Mother also seeks to resist the variation on the basis that the payment of $5,700 should be characterised as part of child maintenance, and as the needs of the child had not changed, there would be no justification to reduce the payment even if the Father no longer enjoyed the use of the property. However, I did not find this categorisation to be accurate. Under the IJ, the Father’s obligation to pay $5,700 towards mortgage repayments and MCST fees would terminate when the Scotts Property was rented out or sold (per Order 3(c)(c) and 3(f)(a)(iii)(b)), and it was further provided that the Mother could unilaterally sell the Scotts Property after the Child ceases to attend his present primary school (Clause 3(c)(b)). Accordingly, the obligation to pay $5,700 was not envisaged as a contribution towards the child’s maintenance. It is apparent that the preservation of the Father’s right to stay in the Scotts Property (despite a transfer of title to the Mother in the division of assets) was designed to provide continuity for the child to reside near his primary school, and to facilitate shared care and control by both parents under the same roof post-divorce for this limited period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Instead, I was of the view that the payment of $5,700 represented the Father’s obligation to pay the imputed rental for the family nucleus to continue residing at the Scotts Property during the Child’s primary school years. That being the case, I did not agree that the Father’s eviction justified the termination of his obligation to pay in entirety. The consent judgment did not specifically provide that the Father’s right to stay was a condition precedent of his payment. Nevertheless, as the Father no longer receives the benefit of living in the Scotts Property, it is equitable for the mortgage payment obligation to be pro-rated accordingly. I therefore apportioned the mortgage payment in equal shares between the three family members, and determined that while the Father should be released from paying his share of the mortgage payment, he should continue to pay two thirds of the mortgage payment for the continued benefit of the Wife and the Child. Hence, the mortgage payment would be reduced by a third from $5,700 to $3,800, and consequentially, the term guaranteeing the Father’s entitlement to reside in the Scotts Property (under clause 3(c)(a)) would be deleted from the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     For completeness, I did consider the Father’s argument that his alternative rental cost of $4,000.00 a month should be taken into consideration in the downward variation. I would simply point out that the loss of his right to reside as one of three family members in the Scotts Property did not necessitate the need to rent an entire apartment for himself. The reduction of $1,700.00 in his payment obligations would be sufficient to allow him to find shared accommodation in another equivalent property. I accordingly did not adjust the pro-ration on account of this argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Whether the variation should be backdated </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Father had sought for any variation of the terms of the IJ to be backdated to the 30 March 2022 incident. I declined to do so for the reason that the Father was aware of but did not seek to vary the IJ until one year later on 29 March 2023. I did not see why the Father could not have filed for variation earlier, given that he had by his own account experienced financial difficulties that led to default on the payments since May 2022. Further, to retrospectively backdate the reduced sum may unduly prejudice the Mother. For this reason, I declined to backdate the variation, and directed that the reduced sum of $3,800 for the mortgage repayment should apply from the date of the application on 29 March 2023. The reduced sum would thus take effect for payments from 1 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     With respect to costs, Counsel for the Father submitted that parties bear their own costs on the basis that the Father had succeeded in two out of the four prayers that he had sought<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, whilst Counsel for the Mother sought costs of $2,500.00 and $1,722.00 in disbursements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.

The plaintiff is the wife of the deceased, and the defendants are the lawful children of the deceased from the latter’s previous marriage. The plaintiff sought orders under Rule 786 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 and Sections 5 and 7 of the Intestate Succession Act 1967. Essentially, she applied for a declaratory order that she had rendered a just and true account of the estate of the deceased and sought permission to distribute to the beneficiaries of the estate their respective shares, after discharging the debts and liabilities of the estate. I allowed the application. The defendants appeal against the same, the notice of appeal having been filed on 22 September 2023. Leave was granted in HCF/OSP 6/2023 to extend the time to file the notice as attempts to do so within legislated timelines were unsuccessful for various reasons. There is no appeal against the order on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Factual Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The deceased passed away on 21 April 2020. The parties jointly applied for and obtained a grant of letters of administration for the estate. The order in terms of the prayer for such appointment in FC/P 2371/2020 was granted on 30 June 2020. An estate account was set up by the plaintiff for which the parties were joint signatories. The Schedule of Assets was filed 9 months later on 15 March 2021 with a supplementary affidavit signed by all parties confirming the accuracy of the Schedule. Subsequently, the grant of letters of administration was issued on 3 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In his lifetime, the deceased had set up an electrical engineering business which was registered as a private limited company. It ceased operations in 2018 which is approximately 2 years prior to his passing. Among the assets of this business was a property along Aljunied Road (Aljunied property). The Aljunied property comprised an office and a factory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In June 2020, the plaintiff engaged in discussions with the defendants on the sale of this Aljunied property. The parties agreed that it should be sold. This meant that there was a need to clear the property of chattels to enable delivery of vacant possession to the eventual purchaser.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 15 August 2020, there was a meeting between the parties at the Aljunied property and the defendants were informed of the need to dispose the chattels. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants agreed to let the plaintiff handle the disposal. The plaintiff accordingly engaged a contractor who disposed the chattels on 1 December 2020. The plaintiff claimed that she received $1 000 for this and deposited the same into the business account on 3 December 2020. The sale of the Aljunied property was completed on 14 October 2021 and an amount of $687 616.71 was received and deposited into the estate account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The plaintiff then took steps to divide the estate monies, but the defendants were initially unresponsive to the plaintiff’s request to endorse the accounts of the estate prepared by her and later resistant to the plaintiff’s account of how she dealt with the chattels at the Aljunied property. On 3 January 2022, the plaintiff received a letter demanding that she provide a just and true account of the estate of the deceased. The defendants disputed the position of the plaintiff that they had consented to her disposing the chattels, pointing to a lack of information on when it was to be disposed and a lack of agreement on the value that it could be disposed for. They alleged that the plaintiff must have received a much higher sum than declared as the chattels comprised more than wires and scrap material. They suggested that she may have pocketed the proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In <b><em>Tacplas Property Services Pte Ltd</em></b> v <b><em>Lee Peter Michael (administrator of the estate of Lee Ching Miow)</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Court of Appeal, having considered conflicting authorities on the point, was of the view that administrators of an estate must act jointly and the act of one administrator cannot be said to be binding on the estate unless the other administrators had ratified the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Where an administrator and a third party enter into an agreement, the co-administrator cannot challenge that agreement if there is clear and unequivocal representation on his part that he had consented to the agreement. This consent can be implied.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Silence or a lack of action alone however would not be sufficient to indicate consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As seen in <b><em>Tacplas</em></b> however, there is a line recognised to exist between mere silence and silence even when there was a duty to act. A lack of action by a co-administrator when there is a duty to act may give rise to arguments rooted in the doctrine of estoppel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application of the Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It was the position of the plaintiff that there was only scrap material and wire at the premises and that she had the consent of the defendants in disposing these to deliver vacant possession to the buyers. It was the contention of the defendants however, that they had seen much more than scrap material and wires when they visited the premises in August 2020. As a contractor himself, the first defendant said he was able to provide an estimate of the value and did so as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.72%\"><col width=\"50.28%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cables and Wires</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$6 000+</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Electrical components</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">approximately $2 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tools and Equipment</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$3 000 to $4 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Other metal materials</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">approximately $4 000</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the affidavit of the first defendant, he exhibited messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> sent on <em>WhatsApp</em> messenger between him and the children of the plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Part of the exchange on 3 July 2021 is reproduced as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"44.12%\"><col width=\"55.88%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">First Respondent (1<sup>st</sup> R):</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Where are all the thing in the factory?</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Applicant’s children (AC):</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Sold and cleared</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1<sup>st</sup> R: </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>and the money recovered?</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AC:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Paid off the debts</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1<sup>st</sup> R:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>please clearly indicate thanks</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AC:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Yup.

This led to the plaintiff providing the name of a representative of the management agency that ran the Aljunied Industrial Complex as an alternative. This representative informed the first defendant that the plaintiff dealt directly with the contractor. The plaintiff shared that this contractor was a “specialist collection company”. The representative shared that he informed the plaintiff that she should check with all the stakeholders before disposing the items.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The representative of the management agency did not however file an affidavit. The defendants believe that the lack of proper information on the disposal company points to the plaintiff’s mismanagement of the business assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I was of the view on the totality of the evidence that the plaintiff had discharged her obligations as an administrator and the orders reflect this position. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 15 August 2020, the plaintiff had asked the defendants for their attendance at the Aljunied property. They were told by the plaintiff to take from the property anything that they had wanted to keep, and the defendants had accordingly taken some items. The plaintiff could not recall what the specific items were. I had asked for clarification from the defendants’ counsel as to whether there was anything taken by their clients belonging to the deceased which were not included in the Schedule of Assets. The counsel by way of correspondence to the Court on 31 January 2023 confirmed that the first defendant had taken a mobile phone and a smart watch while the second defendant had taken a gold ring. These were allowed by the plaintiff. No value was ascribed to them, and these are not reflected in the Schedule of Assets. These were in fact taken prior to the filing of the Schedule of Assets and the supplementary affidavit confirming the accuracy of the Schedule by both the plaintiff and the defendants on 15 March 2021 and before the issuance of the grant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Schedule of Assets similarly makes no reference to the chattels at the Aljunied property that is the subject of this dispute. If there was a view by the defendants that these were assets of the business and that these were of significant value, this Schedule would not have been endorsed, or should not have been endorsed, by them. They chose to confirm the accuracy of the Schedule by way of their supplementary affidavit affirmed on 4 March 2021 and filed on 15 March 2021. Additionally, other than what the first defendant says the value of the chattels seen at the property is likely to be, a view anchored in the fact that he is a contractor by vocation and appreciates the value of equipment, there is little basis to support this position. In his tabulation, he refers to items generally and estimates value without any indication of possible depreciation or whether these were working items, even on the tenuous assumption that he recalls what he saw at the meeting in 2020 with sufficient clarity. While it is clear from the <em>WhatsApp</em> messages that the first defendant did not agree that the value of the disposed items could be accepted at $1 000, he appears to have agreed to it being disposed. He appears to have been satisfied with the plaintiff doing the needful to dispose those items. It was never the desire of the plaintiff to oversee all matters. The fact that the defendants were comfortable with her handling the estate is telling. To point to the fact that the plaintiff was the sole director of the business after the deceased’s passing and was therefore better placed to handle matters relating to the business premises at Aljunied does not place on her a higher burden as co-administrator. She certainly owes fiduciary duties to beneficiaries of which she is one, to call, collect and convert assets into cash and to pay towards funeral and testamentary expenses as well as debts and other liabilities of the estate (<b><em>VIK </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>VIL &amp; Ors</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This is equally applicable to the defendants as co-administrators. The plaintiff was not standing in the way of the defendants’ involvement as co-administrators even as it relates to the business of the deceased. What may have been a convenient arrangement for the defendants to leave it to the plaintiff given her directorship, it should not now be used to defend a lack of action on the part of the defendants on the specific issue of the chattels at the Aljunied property when there was always a duty to act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The business ceased operations for 2 years prior to the passing of the deceased. It is unclear what remained at the premises and its value. The defendants did not appear to know and instead appear to have had very little care when parties met at the premises on 15 August 2020, at least until a value that they were not comfortable with was presented. The document that was produced and which shows an amount of $1 000 having been received suggests that the items after approximately 2 years since the business ceased, had depreciated significantly. I accept that the document speaks little about the items that were disposed, who disposed it and how the value was determined. Other than the defendants’ disbelief however, there was no evidence to show clearly that the plaintiff had falsely reported the facts in particular the value of the chattels. The difference between the plaintiff’s position that they were valued at $1 000 and the defendants’ estimation of $16 000 is $15 000. The value of the items that were taken by the defendants from the premises which are not accounted for in the Schedule of Assets may be of equal or more value. If anything, the administration by all the parties may be said to be lacking in diligence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It would be practically impossible for the plaintiff to retrace steps to prove the value today. Vacant possession was delivered to the buyers with the consent of all the administrators. The timing of the deposit of the $1 000 into the business account, i.e., on 3 December 2020, suggests that the plaintiff had accounted for the money shortly after it was received and did not do so only upon the threat of legal action. The likelihood of this being a fabrication was low, especially as pointed out above, the items were not stated in the Schedule. The defendants did not question the omission in the Schedule. They were in fact allowed to retain personal belongings of the deceased and the defendants did so without any concern that these should typically be included in the Schedule of Assets, rationalising it as something that the plaintiff permitted. Even though the <em>WhatsApp</em> exchanges between the plaintiff or through her children and the defendant, more particularly the first defendant, were often tense, the defendants were content to continue relying on the plaintiff to do all that was necessary to call in the assets and prepare for distribution. What effectively stands against the plaintiff in taking steps to discharge the debts of the estate and distribute the assets is the issue of the disposal of items carried out in 2020 which is challenged on an unsupported allegation that it was valued at about $16 000. This comes after consenting to have the plaintiff take steps to dispose the items. The difficulty in going beyond what has been documented by the plaintiff and the Schedule makes any further enquiry likely to be futile while adding costs disproportionate to the value of the subject in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The defendants took the position that there was no need for a “specialist collection company” to take away scrap material and that could have been left to a rag-and-bone man. The fact that it was not done by a rag-and-bone man, they contend, must mean that the items were much more than scrap material. There was no evidence to support such a conclusion. Having said that, it can be safely assumed that there are many disposal companies in Singapore, and they transact in different ways. While the plaintiff could certainly have done things better even though she may not have realised the gravity of poor record keeping at the time and could have insisted on better documentation from the company that disposed the items, the picture that the evidence paints is one that suggests that she had the endorsement of the defendants to act in the way she did. The timing of the disposal which was well before the letters of administration were granted and the lack of reference to the items in the Schedule accepted by all parties, provide relevant context supporting this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The defendants had effectively given the plaintiff the task of managing key matters in the administration of the estate when they could have been more actively involved in the same. The defendants as co-administrators are not spectators who sit back and approve or disapprove the performance of the main player, in this case, the plaintiff. Even if the defendants were comfortable to allow or felt compelled to allow the plaintiff to take control of matters, the plaintiff had in fact taken steps to engage the defendants on the issue of the items at the Aljunied property. The agreement to allow the plaintiff to dispose the items but later sharing their discomfort with not having been informed of the date she was going to do it or the value that was offered, may certainly suggest a lack of unequivocal representation of consent. The first defendant’s affirmative answer when asked by the plaintiff if she could dispose the items however, and by not taking any steps to have it valued himself make the challenge by the defendants, in the larger context of the other factors highlighted above, unmeritorious. The delay in administering the estate over this dispute has also stood in the way of attending to the debts and liabilities of the estate fully and the plaintiff had in my view, little choice but to seek the orders that she did.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/3814-M.xml')\">[2000] SGCA 5</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraphs 38 and 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 62</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See also <b><em>Foo Gee Finance Co Ltd </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>Liu Cho Chit and another action</em></b> [1998] 2 SLR 121</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Page 6 of the first defendant’s affidavit of 27 October 2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Similar exhibits are found in the plaintiff’s affidavit of 25 November 2022 at Tab 1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Tab 1 of the affidavit of first defendant dated 27 October 2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Without edits</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>See in particular page 73 of the plaintiff’s second affidavit of 25 November 2022 for full text of the discussion in this regard.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24850-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 12</a></p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2023-12-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 664 of 2022","title":"WSN v WSO","citation":"[2023] SGFC 33","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30779-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mohamed Hashim Bin Abdul Rasheed and Sofia Bennita d/o Mohamed Bakhash (A Mohamed Hashim) for the Mother","Mohamed Fazal Bin Abdul Hamid (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Father."],"timestamp":"2023-12-21T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Zhi Xiang","html":"<root><head><title>WSN v WSO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WSN <em>v</em> WSO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30779-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 33</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I dismissed the application for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I first address the Mother’s application for spousal maintenance. The application was dismissed because her reasonable expenses did not exceed her income. The Mother’s estimated expenses were around $1,700 a month, or $1,300 a month taking into adjustments for joint household expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It appeared from the Mother’s submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that she wanted the Father to pay her expenses fully. This was despite the Mother’s own position that she was earning $1,000 a month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It was also notable that the Mother’s declared expenses included $600 a month for allowance to parents, and $221 a month for holiday expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It bears emphasis that as divorce proceedings were underway in the Syariah Court, any order that I could have made would have been interim in nature, to address the parties’ immediate financial needs without a full investigation of the parties’ respective financial positions, and that any order would have been intended to provide modest maintenance (often calculated on a conservative basis) to tide the parties over pending the final determination of the parties’ divorce: see <em>VVQ v VVR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26548-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 97</a> at [21], citing <em>UEC v UEB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20614-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 92</a> at [10] and <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0506.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 506</a> at [22]); see also an academic view at [11] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I did not think that the Mother could reasonably expect the Father to pay for the maintenance of her own parents. The sum of $221 a month for vacations was also rather high taking into account the interim nature of these proceedings. Considering these factors, the Mother’s declared salary was sufficient to cover her expenses, whether calculated on an actual or adjusted basis. Indeed, even during re-examination by her own counsel, the Mother accepted: “the salary I’m earning is only for my---e---enough for---for my personal expenses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I came to this conclusion without even considering the Mother’s rental income and earning capacity, which was likely to be higher than her current income given her higher past salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother’s application for maintenance for herself was therefore dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother’s application for the children was dismissed because she had not shown that the Father had neglected to pay reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As a preliminary point, I clarify that in coming to my decision, to give the Mother the maximum benefit of the doubt, I assumed that, save for the eldest child’s university fees, the Mother’s stated reasonable expenses of the children were reasonable. The children’s reasonable expenses were likely to be significantly lower given that for each of the four children, the Mother included $221 <em>per month per child</em> for “entertainment and holiday”, and $70 a month for “furniture and electronic”: <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> see [11] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother’s case was that the Father had neglected to pay for the children’s reasonable expenses. In particular, she pointed out that her employment by the Father was terminated, and that the Father had terminated the utilities account and the tenancy at one of their properties. The Mother also submitted strenuously that the Father was hiding his income and assets and could afford the maintenance she was seeking. The Father’s case was essentially that he had not failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The law on the reasonableness of maintenance is set out in <em>UHA v UHB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> (“<em>UHA v UHB</em>”). Aside from the reasonableness of the nature of quantum of expenses, the Court also considers the reasonableness of communication of expenses. Thus, “to find neglect or refusal to provide maintenance, the alleged non-paying party must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses”: at [48]. The Court further added at [59] and [60]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… The Mother has to communicate the child’s needs and expenses reasonably. The Father has to have an opportunity to provide reasonable maintenance before the matter is escalated to court. Regardless of how extensive court proceedings are, I do not think the request should be found only in an affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I find that despite the Father’s requests, the Mother did not provide any information on the child’s expenses before commencing the maintenance application. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is clear from the above that the child’s needs and expenses must be communicated <em>before</em> the application for maintenance is filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Professor Leong Wai Kum has also written, in relation to maintenance for children (<em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>, LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, 2018 at paragraphs 12.111 and 12.113):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The author suggests that the maintenance of a wife during marriage should be appreciated as the provision of emergency financial help so that the goal in assessing her maintenance must be to ensure that her basic needs are met to the extent which the husband is able to meet them. The same must be true of maintenance of a child by her parent… The relationships… between the child and her parent… are continuing. Intervention by the court into such continuing relationships should be as minimally invasive as possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Such reported cases as there are demonstrate that the amounts ordered tend to be fairly modest. The courts use the law of maintenance to order the defendant to meet the child’s modest neds to the extent that she can…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Discussion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As alluded above, the overarching issue was whether the Father had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. This was the threshold issue that the Mother had to prove before the substance of her claims could be analysed. In my view, she had not crossed this threshold for two independent reasons. First, she had not proven that there was a shortfall between the Father’s contribution and the children’s expenses. Second, she had not shown that even if there was a shortfall, the Father was aware of the shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether there was a shortfall between Father’s contribution and children’s reasonable expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   Lack of clarity in the Mother’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In a case like this, the usual approach would be to first determine the children’s reasonable expenses, then apportion the expenses between parents in accordance with legal principles. The Father’s determined portion (which I assumed was 100% in my analysis here to give the Mother the maximum benefit of the doubt) will then be compared against what he has been providing <em>in fact</em> to determine if there was neglect. However, the Mother’s analysis appears to have stopped at the first step.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In particular, aside from the table at paragraph 14 of her written submissions (discussed at [19] below), the Mother had not set out her own calculations or even estimates, supported with evidence, of the Father’s <em>actual</em> contributions to the children’s expenses. All the Court had to work with were bits and pieces set out below. Thus, it was not possible to even begin calculating if there was a shortfall. I explain with reference to the Mother’s evidence at trial and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the last day of trial, the Mother accepted the Father’s statement in his final affidavit R11 that “I have always paid for the children’s daily expenses, their school fees, and the family holiday”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Her evidence was that both parties contributed:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes, Ma’am. So sorry if I am being confusing, but I’m referring to my client’s latest affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Latest one, okay. R9, okay. Page 3, right?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Page 3, that’s correct. Item 8, can you see? The column.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Uh, yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes. Under children’s expenses, just for the record.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    So, if I could repeat my question? Confronting you with this a---this---this evidence that my client have---</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    he is able to provide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Okay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Are you denying that he pays for all these?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I’m not denying---</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    You’re not denying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    he paying, yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I’m also paying also.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    That’s fine. Yes. Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    So, this is on top of what I’ve paid. Yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Both parties are paying, isn’t it?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yah, correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    That is a point. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I digress briefly to clarify that while Father’s counsel referred to R9 instead of R11 according to the transcripts, the Mother was clearly looking at the correct affidavit, in light of her answers to counsel’s questions. The Father’s counsel also specified that he was referring to the Father’s “latest affidavit”, which was R11. The same reference in R9 relates to the completely different issue of the financial documents for a property, so there could not have been any misunderstanding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother also accepted that the Father had paid at least part of the children’s expenses. In particular, the Mother also accepted that she was not able to bear witness to all the expenses that the Father spent on the children, and that the Father paid for at least some of the children’s food.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Mother also accepted that the Father passed the children money directly when asked.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In re-examination, the Mother, when pushed by her counsel, hesitantly offered a figure of $300 to $400 as the sum that the Father would spend on the children monthly. However, in the same breath, the Mother quickly added that the Father also paid for the children’s clothing when asked, and purchased for the children tickets for a Taylor Swift concert which cost more than $1,000, and that he had also bought them tickets to a Blackpink concert.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father had also exhibited documentary proof that he had paid substantial sums for family holidays.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Clearly, the Father was not as stingy as the Mother sometimes sought to portray him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     More confusingly, there was also a table in the Mother’s submissions where she addressed the Father’s claims on his reasonable expenses on himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Under the second column of the table, it was recorded that the Father claimed that he spent $3,400 per month on the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Under the third column of the same table, it was recorded that the Mother’s assessed “reasonable amount” was $2,004.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> What is this “reasonable amount”? The Mother placed this table here in her submissions with virtually no explanation. Be that as it may, this appears to be amount that the Mother accepted that the Father had been paying a month. If so, why had the Mother not given the Father credit for these payments in her calculations at paragraphs 2 and 7 of her closing submissions? Does this also not contradict her figure of $300 to $400 a month which she mentioned at trial (see preceding paragraph)? In any event, I was unable to accept the revised figure of $2,004, because the Mother’s reasons for revising the Father’s figure downwards was not put to the Father in cross-examination at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In light of the above, I considered that there was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Lack of clarity as to the Mother’s position on extent of the Father’s contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Lack of clarity as to the extent of the Father’s contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Both were independently fatal to the Mother’s case, as the burden was squarely on her to show that the Father had failed to provide adequate maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In relation to (a), even if I had given the Mother the benefit of the doubt and accepted her position as what she had written in the letter of Court of 6 November 2023 (that the Father “was only paying the children’s meals and some expenses on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I was unable to find in her favour because even on the Mother’s own evidence, the Father went beyond contributing to basic necessities and provided for expensive non-essential spending such as holidays and concert tickets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The lack of clarity in the sense of (b) above was more fundamental. Because of the various concessions made by the Mother that the Father had been contributing to the children’s maintenance (see [15] to [18] above), it was important that she set out her calculations on how much the Father had been actually paying, and the shortfall she had to top up. Without the numbers to back her claim, her assertion that the Father had not maintained the children adequately was nothing more than a bare assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Instead, as highlighted above, the Mother’s analysis stopped at the first step: see [13] above. At paragraph 2 of her written submissions, the Mother had claimed almost fully for the children’s reasonable expenses, without giving credit to the Father for his contributions, save for his share of the rental proceeds of a property. Insofar as the Mother sought to argue that she did not take into account the Father’s contributions because they were <em>de minimis</em>, I rejected this argument for the reasons set out in the discussion above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To be clear, it was not sufficient for the Mother to show that she had been paying part of the children’s expenses. She may had, like other loving parents, paid for expenses which went beyond what a Court would consider reasonable and necessary. It was also not sufficient for the Mother to show that her employment by the Father was terminated, or that the Father had terminated the utilities account or the tenancy at one of their properties. All these, if true, would count towards the Father’s contributions (or lack of) when the Syariah Court divides the matrimonial assets. But they did not by themselves show that there was a shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Thus, on this ground alone, I found that the Mother had not proven that the Father had not been contributing adequately to the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Failure to challenge the Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In any event, compounding these difficulties in the Mother’s case was that almost the entirety of the Father’s cross-examination was spent on examining the Father’s assets and means, and whether parties had agreed to settle (an issue which I will address below). As a result, the Father’s evidence that he had been contributing to the children’s maintenance substantially ($3,400)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> was unchallenged in cross-examination. This is striking because the sum of $3,400 is close to the sum which the Mother claimed were the children’s reasonable expenses, a sum which was in any event significantly inflated; if necessary I would have found that the children’s reasonable expenses did not exceed $3,400: see [7] and [11] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I note that a brief part of the Father’s cross-examination was spent on the Father’s claims that he had been spending certain sums on the children ($1,000 on food and groceries, $200 for eating out and $1,150 for entertainment and outings).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Mother was seeking to use this aspect of the Father’s evidence to justify the Mother’s list of expenses, <em>ie</em>, because the Father was spending these sums on the children on top of the Mother’s rental proceeds which she had been spending on the children, it could be argued that the Mother’s list of expenses for the children were not inflated. At no point in this line of cross-examination was the Father’s alleged spending on the children challenged. Indeed, it appears from counsel’s strategy that he accepted the Father’s claims that he had spent those sums on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Further, the Mother, in her letter of 6 November 2023 filed (without leave) in response to the Father’s closing submissions, did not deny that the Father was not cross-examined on this issue, but instead tried to explain this inadequacy in her case by arguing that “the [Father] is well aware of the [Mother]’s case and his case was presented to the [Mother] … and the [Mother] extensively engaged the same”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This missed the point, which was that the Mother’s case that the Father did not contribute adequately to the children’s expenses was not put <em>to the Father</em>. And while the Mother cited case law stating that the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> should not be applied rigidly, the issue of the extent to which the Father had been contributing to the children’s expenses was a key (if not, <em>the</em> key) issue in this case, and the failure of the Mother’s counsel to touch on it on cross-examination was a serious deficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In particular, as stated above at [19], the Mother explained at paragraph 14 of her written submissions her reasons (for each particular expense) for not agreeing with the Father’s claim on how much he had been spending on the children. These reasons were not put to the Father in cross-examination, and hence the Father was not given a chance to rebut the Mother’s position. For example, the Mother disagreed with many of the Father’s declared expenses on the children because the statements tendered were dated 2020, “when the marriage is [sic] still good”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In my view, it did not necessarily follow that the Father would spend less on the children because his relationship with the Mother deteriorated. It was a point that should have been put to the Father during cross-examination. Thus, while the Father was aware of the Mother’s case <em>broadly</em>, he was not aware of the Mother’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> as to the <em>specific expenses</em> in his list of children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I also note that while the Mother had argued that the rule of <em>Browne v Dunn</em> should not be applied rigidly, she also submitted that the Father had failed to put specific questions to her in cross-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> She clearly accepted that important points of a party’s case must be put to the other party. I further note that she argued that it was not put to her that her declared expenses on the children were inflated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In my view, this was misguided. I have expressed my view above that the declared expense of $221 a month per child for holidays was extravagant. In this case, it was not disputed that both parties had spent significant sums on overseas holidays, <em>ie</em>, there was no dispute of <em>fact</em>. The question whether such expenses amounted to reasonable expenses (and whether the Court should in principle order a parent to spend on non-essentials like holidays) is a question of law that could and should be addressed in submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In light of the Mother’s failure to challenge the Father’s evidence on his spending on the children in cross-examination, it would be inequitable for this Court to reject the Father’s evidence for the reasons set out by the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> This, along with the lack of clarify of the Mother’s case as to how much the Father had been spending on the children, made it impossible for this Court to find on a balance of probabilities that the Father had neglected to maintain the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Father was aware of the children’s needs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In any event, even if there was a shortfall, the Father did not neglect to maintain the children because the Father was not aware of the shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The law on the reasonableness of maintenance is set out above. Save for the eldest child’s private university fees, the Mother did not expressly communicate the children’s needs to the Father. She accepted during cross-examination that “You are right to say I never asked for more maintenance, yah”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The Mother confirmed her answer in response to her counsel’s clarification in re-examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay. The follow up---a clarification to that when you say you decided to ask him, did you inform him of the amount you require?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Uh, no, actually, no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Okay. You---no, no, no, I---I am not---I can’t rephrase the question but I’m asking for clarification in answer to the question, right? Whether you’ve him to provide more maintenance. That was the question. Whether you did ask him to provide more maintenance. And you said that you’ve never asked for more maintenance. Right? Can you explain that? Can you clarify?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Okay. I did not ask him for more maintenance, but I did ask him to pay for the son---the son’s tuition fee, which is part of the maintenance, lah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother’s position is that the Father should have asked her whether she had enough money,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and that in any event, she had asked the Father through this application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This is plainly not the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>UHA v UHB</em> is instructive here because the Father here, like the father in <em>UHA v UHB</em>, had been paying some maintenance. He was not a parent who has disappeared from the children’s lives and left them to fend for themselves with their mother. He had made an effort to provide for the children, and if that was not enough, it was incumbent on the Mother to inform him before filing this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It bears noting that in a letter of clarification from Mother’s counsel dated 19 October 2023, the Mother’s counsel did not point the Court to any instance when the Mother had communicated the children’s needs to the Father, save for the eldest child’s private university tuition. While I will address the merits of the Mother’s claim on the eldest child’s private university fees separately below, I will just observe here that it is not clear why the Mother felt able to raise the question of tuition fees but no other aspects of maintenance to the Father. In re-examination, the Mother sought to explain why she did not ask the Father for additional money for the children’s maintenance:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I have to justify what I am spending. I have to justify to get more money. It was a chore to ask him. Right?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     If it was a “chore” to ask the Father for more money, or if there was any other unspoken reason, why was the Mother able to expressly ask the Father to pay the eldest child’s private university tuition, but not for the children’s other expenses? This, in my view, highlights the fact that the Mother had not sufficiently explained why she had not sought maintenance from the Father before the application was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Shortly before the decision of this matter was delivered, the Mother filed further submissions on 6 November 2023. A new argument in the letter was that <em>UHA v UHB</em> could be distinguished on its facts, and that the touchstone is whether the respondent in an application of maintenance must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs. The Mother submitted that because the Father had terminated her employment and the tenancy at one of their properties, the Father must have been aware that she needed more money for maintenance. I was prepared to accept the Mother’s submission that <em>UHA v UHB</em> does not require express communication in every case, and that a respondent’s awareness of the children’s needs can in principle be inferred from the circumstances. However, even if that were correct, I did not think that the circumstances were such that the Father was or ought to have been aware of any shortfall in the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Mother did not dispute that the Father had been contributing to the children’s maintenance (see the discussion from [14] above). As such, it did not necessarily follow from the Mother’s allegations of the Father’s conduct (even if true) that the children were not being reasonably maintained by either or both parents. The Father could have assumed that what he had been providing, together with the Mother’s fair contributions, were largely sufficient. In any event, it was not put to the Father that he must or should have been aware that the children were in need of maintenance because of these reasons. Thus, I did not accept, even on the Mother’s reading of <em>UHA v UHB</em>, that the Father was or ought to have been aware (even if true) that there was a shortfall in the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     For completeness, it was also significant that the Father had obliged when the children asked for money: [17] and [18] above. This showed that he was willing to pay extra if it was made known to him that the children required more money. This further cemented my view that Court intervention was not appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Private University tuition fees</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I address this expense separately because it was undisputed that the Mother had informed the Father about this expense before the claim was filed. The Mother gave evidence that when she informed the Father about the eldest child’s private university tuition fees, the Father did not want to pay because he was of the view that the eldest child should have enrolled in ITE.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The quantum of fees can also be determined easily. Thus, the above discussion does not apply to this specific expense. I am hence prepared to consider this expense on its merits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Nevertheless, I am of the view that the Father should not, at least at this juncture, be ordered to pay the eldest child’s fees. In <em>UYT v UYU and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24272-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 8</a> (“<em>UYT v UYU</em>”), the High Court, faced with a similar situation, remarked that the Court was placed in an unenviable position to compare and assess different courses. However, this was not even possible here as the Mother’s evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> only explained why she had enrolled the eldest child in a private university – she did not lead evidence as to why she had chosen to enrol the eldest child in a private university <em>instead of pursuing other more affordable options</em>. No attempt to weigh the different options was clear from the evidence. In my view, this was a necessary step to show that the decision to enrol the eldest child into a private university was reasonable. This was especially since the fees at the private university were not negligible – the Mother was claiming more than $23,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The fact that the Mother had decided to enrol the eldest child in a private university did not mean that the Father was automatically obliged to pay for the tuition fees. As the High Court held in <em>UYT v UYU</em> at [12]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… s 69(5)(c) WC, which the court below relied upon, does not create a specific obligation on the parent to pay for the tertiary education of the child. Section 69(5)(c) is to be read with s 69(2) WC, and that is a provision for the duty of a parent to provide maintenance. Maintenance, as we know, does not mean maintaining fully or of an unreasonable amount. To say that a parent has a duty to maintain a child is not the same as saying he must pay for all the expenses of the child’s education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, this expense did not become reasonable simply because the Father could afford it: see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a> at [50]. It also bears emphasis that there was no Court order granting the Mother unilateral authority to make decisions on the eldest child, nor was there an order for the Father to pay for the eldest child’s general education expenses. Thus, given that the Mother had not adduced evidence as to why it was reasonable to enrol the eldest child in a private university as opposed to other more affordable options, I declined to order the Father to pay those fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I also considered the possibility of ordering the Father to pay a reasonable amount for the eldest child’s tertiary education expenses. However, as I was not addressed on this point, nor was any evidence led on what would have been a reasonable amount, I did not make such an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Agreement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother also raised a collateral issue on whether there was an agreement to settle the matter. In my view, this was not relevant save as to costs. The parties had not recorded an agreement through the offer-to-settle regime, nor had they recorded a consent order in Court. Insofar as the Mother sought to argue that parties had entered into a private agreement, this was a matter for contract law, for which this Court has no jurisdiction to apply. To be clear, this Court can take into account an agreement while making orders pursuant to s 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961, but as explained above, this was not possible because the threshold issue of neglect (which must be crossed before s 69 can be invoked) had not been crossed. There is also no order provision in the Women’s Charter 1961 that empowers a Family Court to directly enforce a private agreement on maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I considered the possibility of setting out my views on both parties’ assets and means and the maintenance I would have ordered if I were wrong on the above issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     However, I decided against that. First, doing so could result in inconsistent findings between this Court and the Syariah Court, which is hearing the divorce and the ancillary matters. It would also not have been right for this Court to serve as a forum to obtain ammunition for the Syariah Court proceedings. Thus, it would be appropriate to express my views on these issues only if absolutely necessary. Second, the Father had not had an opportunity to respond to the specific allegations on his assets and means in the Mother’s written submissions. If the proceedings were remitted back to me, I would prefer to grant the Father a right of reply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I dismissed the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I stress again that in coming to this conclusion, I assumed that the Mother’s case on the children’s reasonable expenses were reasonable, and that the Father should be responsible for all of the children’s reasonable expenses. Both assumptions were made for the benefit of the Mother and were highly unlikely to hold true if a full analysis were carried out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I fixed costs at $30,000 to be paid by the Mother to the Father. In fixing costs, I took into the account the number of trial dates, the offer-to-settle made by the Father, and the Father’s disruptive and discourteous conduct at trial, in contrast to the Mother whom I find to be an honest and earnest witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I also note that this was an extraordinary case which had taken too long to conclude considering the nature of the matter. The Mother had served requests for discovery and interrogatories totally more than 100 items right on the doorstop of trial, which necessitated a lengthy adjournment. A large proportion of time was also spent on cross-examination of the Father’s assets and means, an issue which had become moot. The Father’s difficult conduct had also contributed to the delay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I also register my disapproval at the Mother’s filing of further submissions by way of letter on 6 November 2023 without leave. It is trite that such conduct is a discourtesy to the Court, and the Court is at liberty to disregard such submissions: <em>WJM v WNN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29555-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 18</a> at [13] and <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/28897-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 2 SLR 380</a> at [9]. I had only addressed the arguments in the letter to show the Mother that her case would fail even if I were to consider all her arguments. It should not be taken as encouragement for any counsel to do the same in the future.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\"

District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The breakdown of any long-term relationship can bring about significant complications. The breakdown of a union involving transnational parties has the potential to bring about even more complex issues, particularly when there are disputes over the care arrangements of young children and where they should live.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This matter involved competing applications under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (“<b>GIA</b>”), by both the Father and the Mother, who were divorcing transnationals, in relation to two (2) young children: the 1<sup>st</sup> son aged 6 (“<b>Eldest Son</b>”) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> son aged 2 (“<b>Youngest Son</b>”) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “<b>Children</b>”). The Father filed FC/OSG 8/2023 (“<b>OSG 8</b>”) and the Mother filed FC/OSG 40/2023 (“<b>OSG 40</b>”). The Father is the Plaintiff in OSG 8 and the Defendant in OSG 40 (the “<b>Father</b>”) and the Mother is the Plaintiff in OSG 40 and the Defendant in OSG 8 (the “<b>Mother</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       At the crux of this case, the Court was given the heavy task of intervening when the transnational parents could not reach a consensus on the care arrangements for their two (2) young Children, including which of two (2) countries they would reside in. Additionally, the Court also had to grapple with the issues of the custody, care and control of and access to the Children and the sharing of parental responsibilities for the maintenance of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father is in his early 40s. He was an Indian Citizen but acquired Singapore Citizenship in 2005 after completing his university studies in Singapore. He is, however, still considered as an Overseas Citizen of India (“<b>OCI</b>”; a form of permanent residency available to people of Indian origin and their spouses which allows them to live and work in India indefinitely).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother is in her mid-30s and is an Indian Citizen. She, however, acquired Singapore Permanent Residency (“<b>PR</b>”) Status in 2013. Her PR status was then renewed in 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties were married on 8 July 2012 in Singapore, and shortly thereafter, had further wedding celebrations in India. Parties only resided together in Singapore from March to December 2012 for about 9 months. Then, in 2013, the Mother relocated to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“<b>UAE</b>”) for a period of time, with the Father making regular weekend trips to visit the Mother in the UAE. In 2014, the Parties jointly relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America (“<b>USA</b>”) for the Mother’s Master of Business Administration (“<b>MBA</b>”) studies. The Father initially only found work a state away in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, in August 2014 and would do weekly commutes to be with the Mother. He then managed to find work in Boston, USA, in May 2015 and continued to work there until 2020. The Father also managed to get a USA Green Card (i.e. USA Permanent Residency Status).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Eldest Son was born in Boston, USA on xxx 2017. The Parties continued to reside there for another 3 years thereafter. In April 2020, the Father found a new and better job in Singapore, and the Father, the Mother and Eldest Son relocated to Singapore. This was during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Mother continued to work for her USA-based company remotely, before subsequently finding work with a Singapore multinational technology company headquartered in Singapore. In June 2021, the Parties purchased a luxury condominium at the seafront (the “<b>Matrimonial Home</b>”), which was held in the Father’s sole name as the Mother was only a Singapore PR and not a Singapore Citizen. The Father applied for Singapore Citizenship for the Eldest Son, but this was withdrawn, purportedly because the Mother did not want the Eldest Son to have Singapore citizenship. This was disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In July 2021, the Eldest Son, the Father and the Mother, who was then 33 weeks’ pregnant with the Parties’ 2<sup>nd</sup> child flew to Houston, Texas, USA, for the birth of the Youngest Son on 23 August 2021. After the birth, they continued to reside there for about 3 months before returning to Singapore. It is disputed as to whose idea this was for them to have the birth of the Youngest Son in Houston, USA, but the intention was to allow the Youngest Son to have USA Citizenship, similar to the Eldest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Thus, at all material times, the Children were USA citizens and were residing in Singapore under Long-Term Visit Passes (“<b>LTVPs</b>”). The Father did eventually apply for the Children to be Singapore PRs, purportedly without the Mother’s Consent in November 2022, after they had already left for India and this Singapore PR Status was only approved in July 2023 in the middle of the contested proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In March 2022, Parties encountered marital issues. Both Parties accused the other of committing abuse. In any event, it is undisputed that the Mother took the Children to India. The Parties had initially been planned for a short trip of about a week, but the Mother stayed there with the Children for about 3 months. This was the Parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> separation. Parties managed to reconcile and the Mother and the Children returned to Singapore in May 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 20 November 2022, there was an alleged event of family violence, where the Mother claimed that the Father had, among other things, strangled her. The Father also alleged that the Mother was violent to him. These allegations were disputed. While the Mother initially filed for a personal protection order in Singapore, she did not pursue it. The Mother purportedly raised these allegations for determination in Indian proceedings. As of the reporting of this decision, there has been no court determination on these allegations either in Singapore or in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     After this alleged event in November 2022, the Mother took the Children and left the Matrimonial Home to reside with a friend in Singapore. After a couple of days, she decided to take the Children overseas to India to be with her family. This was a few days earlier than an overseas trip that had been planned prior to the incident. The Father subsequently travelled to India to try to reconcile with the Mother but was unsuccessful and returned to Singapore by himself. The Mother and the Children then failed to return to Singapore from India in early January 2023 as previously planned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 17 January 2023, the Father promptly filed for the guardianship of the Children in OSG 8 and, among other things, requested for the Children to be returned to Singapore. At the 1<sup>st</sup> Case Conference for OSG 8 on 25 January 2023, by consent, the Father was granted interim virtual access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Subsequently, the Father also filed for divorce in Singapore on 21 February 2023 (“<b>Divorce Proceedings</b>”). As at the time of this decision, pleadings have completed and Parties were due to proceed with a contested divorce trial. However, both parties have filed multiple interim applications, which is elaborated on subsequently in paragraph 28.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother, on 27 March 2023, also filed for the guardianship of the Children in OSG 40, which included seeking on order for the Court to allow the Children to continue residing in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Parties attempted Court-mandated mediation for OSG 8, OSG 40 and the Divorce Proceedings holistically, but were unable to resolve their issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Overall, parties filed multiple affidavits for the contested OSG 8 and OSG 40 proceedings:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"10.56%\"><col width=\"18.94%\"><col width=\"70.5%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Affidavit</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">17 Jan 23</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father’s Supporting Affidavit for OSG 8</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">19 Jan 23</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father’s Affidavit of Service in OSG 8</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">27 Mar 23</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother’s Supporting Affidavit for OSG 40</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(d)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">24 Apr 23</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father’s Reply Affidavit in OSG 8 &amp;

Both the Father and the Mother initially had legal representation, but by the time of this hearing, both of them had discharged their lawyers and were self-represented. The Father filed a Notice of Intention to Act in Person on 20 June 2023 for OSG 8 and the Divorce Proceedings. The Mother then filed her Notice of Intention to Act in Person on 8 July 2023 for OSG 8, OSG 40 and the Divorce Proceedings, after the 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions had been filed by her lawyers. The Father then filed a Notice of Intention to Act in Person in OSG 40 on 9 July 2023. With regard to the Mother’s initial lawyer and then, replacement lawyer, the Father made certain allegations of conflict of interest, before the Mother had discharged their services. In any event, throughout the proceedings of OSG 8 and OSG 40, both the Father and the Mother confirmed with the Court that while they did not have legal representation for the contested proceedings of OSG 8 and 40, they consulted lawyers within Singapore on various matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At the 1<sup>st</sup> half-day hearing on 11 July 2023 (the “<b>1<sup>st</sup> Hearing</b>”), significant issues were raised. Given the significant number of issues raised in the hearing, oral arguments could not be completed within that 1<sup>st</sup> half-day hearing. Additionally, Parties were directed to provide further written submissions and affidavits on a list of issues. As such, further urgent half-day hearings were fixed on 10 August 2023 (the “<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing</b>”) for the completion of oral arguments and on 31 August 2023 (the “<b>3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing</b>”) for rebuttals, decision and costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     By consent, further interim virtual access orders were made at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, which helped to clarify the Father’s and Mother’s responsibilities in facilitating such access (“<b>Interim Virtual Access Orders</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Between the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, the Father filed FC/SUM 2355/2023 (“<b>SUM 2355</b>”) in OSG 8 on 25 July 2023 for leave to commence committal proceedings against the Mother for purported breaches of the Interim virtual access orders. However, the Father decided to withdraw SUM 2355 at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, when procedural irregularities were highlighted to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father filed his 2<sup>nd</sup> Written Submissions on 4 August 2023 (“<b>Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions</b>”) with a supplementary bundle of authorities, and then filed a 2<sup>nd</sup> supplementary bundle of authorities on 7 August 2023. The Mother filed an Affidavit on 17 August 2023 as her written submissions on the outstanding matters (“<b>Mother’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Parties completed their oral arguments in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing. A day after, the Father filed in the Divorce Proceedings on 11 August 2023, an <em>ex parte</em> application seeking a Mareva Injunction (“<b>Mareva Injunction Proceedings</b>”). The Father was heard by a duty judge on 14 August 2023 and was directed to provide further evidence and to notify the Mother. On 21 August 2023, Mareva Injunction Proceedings was heard on an <em>ex parte</em> basis, with the Mother observing on a watching brief having been provided 2 hours prior notice of the hearing. Given the evidence provided and arguments made, a Mareva Injunction was ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the 3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing on 31 August 2023, having carefully considered Parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions and various oral arguments, I rendered my oral decision.

The Mother did not appeal against either of my decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On 9 September 2023, the Father filed for an expedited appeal in DCA 87 and 88, which was heard on 18 and 20 October 2023 and dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Separately, since my decision in OSG 8 &amp; 40, as at the time of this reported decision, Parties have also filed other summons proceedings in the Divorce Proceedings:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Father, on 11 September 2023, also filed an application for leave to commence committal proceedings on the basis of the Mother’s failure to make disclosure pursuant to the Mareva Injunction, which was allowed on 15 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother filed an application to set aside the Mareva Injunction, among other things (“<b>Setting Aside Proceedings</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Father filed an application for committal proceedings against the Mother (“<b>Committal Proceedings</b>”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Mother filed an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in favour of Indian divorce proceedings which were filed after the decisions in OSG 8 and 40, but were purportedly yet to be served on the Father (“<b>Stay Proceedings</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The Setting Aside Proceedings was dismissed on 8 November 2023 and the Mother was found to be guilty of breaching orders of disclosure in the Committal Proceedings. Stay Proceedings have yet to be determined as of the date of this reporting. Hence, contested Divorce Proceedings have not commenced pending the determination of the Stay Proceedings. It is fairly evident that matters remain fairly contentious between the Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In the circumstances, the full grounds of my decision are provided below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the different positions taken by the Mother and Father, the following issues that had to be considered in this matter were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether to reverse relocation or to order the return of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Care and Control of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Education of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Access to the Children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Children Maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There were also some preliminary issues that were raised, which I have touched on briefly before delving into the key issues:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether Singapore has the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matters;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether OSG 40 should have been applied as a summons application in the Divorce Proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the Family Court has the power to direct the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority to prevent a person from leaving Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Whether the Family Court can direct that thee be Mirror Orders in Indian Proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 1: Whether Singapore has the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matters?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The OSG 8 and 40 proceedings were complicated by the fact that the Mother had also simultaneously pursued Indian proceedings which include a custody petition and a domestic violence case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     There were no concurrent personal protection order applications in Singapore on family violence, even though the purported acts occurred in Singapore, and instead, these allegations were pursued in India. In any event, the Indian domestic violence case did not significantly overlap with the subject matter of OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     However, the Mother’s custody proceedings in India had a clear overlap with both the OSG Proceedings and the Divorce Proceedings in Singapore, which could result in a multiplicity of proceedings with potentially different outcomes. The Father had claimed that his Indian Counsel had filed for the dismissal of the Mother’s case in India on jurisdictional issues, but such a hearing would take a further 6 to 8 months. It is unclear whether there has been any determination of this after my orders in OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Both Parties admitted that the progress on the Indian custody proceedings had been slow and could take a few years if it is not dismissed on jurisdictional issues, whereas for the OSG 8 and 40, were heard within a few months from commencement and determination was rendered in a significantly shorter time frame.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Both Parties also acknowledged that there were mechanisms to enforce Singapore orders in India, and that deference may be given to the Singapore Orders in OSG 8 and 40 for international comity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It is noteworthy that neither side had filed for a stay of Singapore OSG Proceedings or an anti-suit injunction to prevent the Indian Proceedings from moving forward. Hence, I did not have to make a determination as to whether Singapore was the most appropriate forum to adjudicate these issues in OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Both the Father and the Mother submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts for the proceedings under the GIA and would be bound by the decisions reached in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 2: Whether OSG 40 should have been applied as a summons application in the Divorce Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I move on to the next preliminary issue that was raised by the Father, of whether OSG 40 should have been a Summons Application in the Divorce Proceedings, instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     When OSG 8 was commenced, there were no divorce proceedings, but when OSG 40 was commenced, the Divorce Proceedings had already been filed. The Father initially argued that this was improper, but in subsequent submissions he acknowledged that this was not a crucial issue on hindsight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, given that the Father filed OSG 8, the Mother was at liberty to file OSG 40, as this would be competing claims on an equal footing. If the Mother were to commence proceedings under the Divorce Proceedings the effect of any order made would have the status of being an interim order as opposed to a final order in the OSG matters. Additionally, I took the Mother’s point that if there were any withdrawal of the divorce, then that would invariably do away with her case. Hence there was valid practical effect to have it filed as OSG 40 instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Most importantly, there is no prohibition, in law, that prevents a party from commencing proceedings under the GIA, when there are divorce proceedings commenced. While there may be practical considerations for the management of such cases, the Mother was not incorrect in commencing OSG 40 when Divorce Proceedings had already been commenced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 3: Whether the Family Court has the power to direct Immigration and Checkpoint Authority to prevent a person from leaving Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As part of OSG 8, the Father was initially seeking an order for the Court to direct the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“<b>ICA</b>”) to prevent a person from leaving Singapore and/or removing the Children from Singapore, assuming that the Court were to agree in ordering the return of the Children to Singapore. This is very different from the power of the Court to restrain a party from taking of the Children out of Singapore pursuant to section 131 of the Women’s Charter 1961, which is imposed on the parent and not the ICA. The Father subsequently acknowledged that the Court did not have the power to order the ICA to do such things and abandoned its pursuit in response to directions for further submissions on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As an alternative, the Father instead sought for the Children’s travel documents to be held by him or a neutral party. The possession of the Children’s Passports is an issue that does come under the ambit of custody issues, which is dealt with subsequently in this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 4: Whether the Family Court can direct that there be Mirror Orders in Indian proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In relation to the Father’s request for this Court to order that any orders made in OSG 8 and 40 be mirrored in the orders in India, I had questioned him about the legal basis for the Singapore Family Courts to make such an order to bind the Indian Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In response, the Father had cited the high court decision of <b><em>VLI v VLJ </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26340-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 27</a></b> (“<b><em>VLI v VLJ</em></b>”) decided by Justice Debbie Ong was in relation to whether the Family Courts had the power to direct a husband to apply for a pass for the wife in divorce proceedings. While this is not the same as the Husband’s request, it is an analogous on the basic principle that the Family Court cannot go beyond the provided statutes to exercise inherent jurisdiction to make orders and also applies in relation to preliminary issue 3 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Ordering that the orders reached in Singapore be mirrored in India would be an issue of international comity. Just as our Family Courts would have to consider the foreign orders and relevant arguments before making any mirror orders in Singapore, the Family Court would not be able to insist that the Indian Couts mirror the orders made here. It would, however, be practical for the Parties to make the necessary orders to be mirrored, but the Court is in no position to impose this obligation on the Indian Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 1: Custody of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having addressed these preliminary issues briefly, I move on to the key issue of the custody of the 2 Children aged 6 and 2 years respectively. As explained to the Parties, this entailed a bundle of rights involving major decisions, such as relocation, education, religion and major medical intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Both Parties had began their respective applications both seeking sole custody of the Children. At the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, I had highlighted to Parties to consider the landmark Court of Appeal case of <b><em>CX v CY </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a></b> (“<b><em>CX v CY</em></b>”) that for the Court to depart from the default position of joint custody, that there would need to be exceptional reasons as to why sole custody needed to be ordered (see particularly at [39] of <b><em>CX v CY</em></b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father subsequently clarified at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing and in the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions that he sought sole custody for the primary reason of preventing any further purported abduction of the Children, and since considering the case of <b><em>CX v CY</em></b>, he was willing to agree to joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With regard to the Mother’s position, she was of the view that cooperation with the Father was “<em>impossible</em>” given that the Father was purportedly raising further acrimony. The Mother had argued that if the Father were willing to work on his behavioural issues and take steps towards reducing acrimony, that only then, would she find joint custody to be appropriate. The Mother cited the Father’s purported abusive acts towards her, being allegedly deceitful in hearings and also cited an incident on 20 May 2023 where the Father had gone to the Eldest Son’s School in Noida. She had also raised the issue of the Father’s foul and abusive language over correspondence. The Mother alleged that the Father had made false accusations about access and that he had meddled with the marital finances and made unilateral decisions against the Children’s best interest and had jeopardized the Children’s education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In relation to the allegations of abusive acts, it was undisputed that there was an alleged incident on 19 November 2022, however, the alleged violent acts were unclear save that there was a purported strangling. A personal protection order application was filed and withdrawn and that there was no determination on such allegations in the Indian domestic violence proceedings. The Mother did confirm at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing that there had not been any physical abuse of the Children. The Mother, however, alleged that the Father had called them names and had thrown items around the house, even though it was not directed at any particular person. These allegations, even if they could be proven to be true, did not amount to the issues of abuse that would disqualify a parent from having joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Regarding the Father’s unkind words, having reviewed both sides’ correspondence, it is fair to say that both Parties have exchanged some heated words and could have been a lot less acrimonious in their exchanges, but that also did not rise up to the level that it would make it so acrimonious to disallow joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Allegations of financial abuse and/or mismanagement were definitely troubling, and this would need to be further investigated in the appropriate forum at an appropriate time, but once again, that would not disqualify a parent from sharing joint custody. This similarly applied for disputes over access arrangements, while the Court may need to intervene to resolve issues, this did not warrant granting only 1 parent sole custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     On the issue of the Father’s purported unilateral decisions and messing with the Children’s education, it is noted, that the Mother has made unliteral decisions as well. The fact that there were such allegations of unilateral decisions actually makes it more pertinent that the parents were to be reminded that they cannot make major decisions on their own and that they have to make major decisions for the Children as co-parents. If such agreement was not forthcoming, then the Court would need to intervene and make the relevant decision, but only as a last resort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I agreed with the Father that as stated in <b><em>CX v CY</em></b> at [26] that has since been oft-repeated in multiple subsequent cases that “<em>the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The understanding is that a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In the circumstances, I found no reason to depart from the status quo of joint custody. It is in the Children’s best welfare that both their Parents remain involved in the necessary decision making for major decisions and that the Parents are reminded of this joint responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 2: Whether to reverse relocation and to order the return of the Children?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Having determined that the status quo of joint custody should be maintained, I next delve into the key issue of where the Children should reside, i.e., whether to order that the relocation of the Children to Noida be reversed and order their return to Singapore or to allow them to continue to reside in Noida.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Before we delve into the law on relocation, I first deal with the factual dispute as to whether or not the Father had consented to the Mother on the relocation, which is discuss below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Was consent provided?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Given that there was no order on custody and that joint custody remained unchanged, all major decisions for the Children should have been made jointly instead of unilaterally. The issue of relocating from Singapore to India would definitely be a major decision. Additionally, enrolling the Children in a school and applying for Permanent Residency status would also be major decision, which will be touched upon below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     With regard to this, the Mother claimed that she had embarked on the relocation with the Father’s knowledge and consent, whereas the Father insisted that she had instead abducted the Children and that all he had consented to was for her to bring the Children to India for a planned holiday, albeit a few days early.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother’s case was that the Court should believe her that the Father had provided consent for the relocation of the Children because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     she and the Children had resided in India during the previous separation, between March and May 2022, after a purported incident of the Father beating her when the Eldest Son had a high fever. The Mother further asserted that in a conversation in April 2022, the Father had proposed for them to either continue living in India or to figure out how they were going to reside in Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     then in October 2022, the Mother had stated that if there were to be a divorce, she would not continue to live in Singapore and would want to go back to India, to which, the Father purportedly responded that “<em>that is for you to decide</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     subsequently, on 20 November 2022 after the purported incident of family violence on 19 November 2022, when the Mother was staying with a friend in Singapore, the Father purportedly sent a message that “<em>[y]ou are welcome to come back anytime …. I don’t mind if you need to take them to India</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d\"></a>(d)     additionally, in the 9 months prior, the Mother alleged that relocation had been discussed and the Father had purportedly agreed to relocating back to India; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_e\"></a>(e)     in general, the Father had purportedly allowed the Mother to “<em>figure out children’s arrangements</em>” by herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     While, on the face of this narrative, there appeared to be an agreement for the Mother and the Children to spend some time in India, there did not appear to be sufficient evidence to support the Mother’s case that the Father had unequivocally agreed to a permanent relocation of the Children to India. A past living arrangement for a separation period did not mean that there was consent for a future permanent relocation. The statements made in October and November 2022 were also ambiguous and subject to interpretation. More importantly, the purported discussions on relocating back to India were not corroborated by any documentary evidence and seem to indicate her personal views on wanting to return to India as opposed to a joint position. Additionally, just because the Mother claimed to be the primary parent making arrangements for the Children did not mean that this provided her with <em>carte blanche</em> or implicit consent for a permanent relocation of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Apposite to the Mother’s arguments, the Father strongly denied that he had provided any such consent for relocation. He had provided evidence of him sending emails to certain law firms. He claimed that this was to seek legal advice on how to apply for an injunction to prevent the Mother from removing the Children from Singapore. In this regard, the emails provided only went as far as to show that the Father was looking for legal advice, but did not specifically go towards corroborating his intention to seek an injunction. However, what is significant is that very shortly after the Mother and the Children failed to return back to Singapore after the intended date of return of 3 January 2023, the Father did apply for OSG 8 swiftly by 17 January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In the circumstances, given that the Mother had the burden to prove her assertions, I found that she had not discharged her burden to prove that the Father had provided consent for the Mother to permanently relocate the Children to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     While parties can consent to the relocation, the lack of consent is not fatal to the application. The Court can still determine whether the relocation should be allowed. In this case, the Mother had jumped the gun and unilaterally relocated herself and the Children without seeking the necessary Court intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Is the Hague Convention/International Child Abduction Act 2010 applicable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father had initially argued that the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction (25October 1980) 1343 UNTS 89 (entered into force 1 December 1983) (“<b>Hague Convention</b>”) should apply. However, while Singapore is a signatory, India is neither a contracting party with Singapore, nor is India a signatory to this Hague Convention. Hence, there is basis for an immediate return of the Children to their place of habitual residence before this change in residence, which would have been Singapore, pursuant to section 6 of the International Child Abduction Act 2010 (“<b>ICAA</b>”). The Father then argued that by analogy, the principles applicable to the Hague Convention should also apply to the present case. However, to do so, would be circumventing the intent under the ICAA which only applies to contracting states.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Moreover, the application for the return of the child to the former place of habitual residence under the Hague Convention and the International Child Abduction Act 2010 only relate to the forum to determine issues of the child’s welfare. As clarified at [29] to [34] of <b><em>TDX v TDY </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a></b> (“<b><em>TDX v TDY</em></b>”), particularly at [31], that under the Hague Convention regime, “<em>the habitual residence of the child is the sole criterion in determining which court should decide on the child’s substantive welfare</em>”. Upon application, the Court would still need to determine where the child should reside as a part of the child’s substantive welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     A clear example of this is shown in the case of <b><em>UYK v UYJ </em></b><b>[2020]] SGHCF 9; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a></b> (“<b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>”), where the father had successfully obtained orders in the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”) under their Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (c 60) (UK), which obligated the mother and child to return to Singapore. The mother then applied for sole care and control of the child and relocation of the child from Singapore to the UK. This was granted by the district judge and upheld on appeal. Hence, even though the Hague Convention and ICAA were inapplicable in this case, given both Parties’ submission to jurisdiction, the Court is at liberty to determine the substantive child welfare issues raised in OSG 8 and 40, such as the relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relocation Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Hence, I move on to the relevant authorities and applicable legal principles on relocation for guidance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The key principles that the Court has to consider for a relocation, as stated in the Court of Appeal case of <b><em>BNS v BNT </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a></b> (“<b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>”) is the paramount consideration of the best welfare of the children. Providing further guidance on this, is the High Court case held by Justice Debbie Ong in <b><em>UFZ v UFY </em></b><b>[2018] SGHCF 823; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a></b> (“<b><em>UFZ v UFY</em></b>”) that 2 important factors to balance are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver: and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the children’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Each case is an intensely fact centric exercise. The factors that the Court can consider include “<em>the child’s age, the child’s attachment to each parent and other significant persons in the child’s life, the child’s wellbeing in her present country of residence, as well as the child’s developmental needs at that particular stage of life, including her cognitive, emotional, academic and physical needs</em>” (See <b><em>UXH v UXI </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a></b> (“<b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b>”) at [28])</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Court in <b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>, the High Court also delved into the issue of well-settledness at [51] to [52]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">51    The Father’s case heavily emphasised C’s well-settledness in Singapore. I agreed that whether a child is wellsettled in Singapore is a relevant factor that should be given appropriate weight. It was also important, however, to bear in mind that in a globalised world, families are geographically mobile and adaptable, and the <em>weight to be placed on well-settledness will depend on other related circumstances including how many years the child has lived in that country, the age of the child, and whether that country has been the family’s home for many years.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">52    Well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life… [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Overall, the Courts duty is to balance all considerations for the welfare of the Children. Applying these principles, there have been cases where relocation was allowed and other cases where it was not, which a briefly reviewed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In the recent case of <b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>, as briefly described above in paragraph 69, the mother, who was the primary caregiver, had brought the child to a planned vacation in the UK and did not return. As stated above, the child was ordered to be returned to Singapore, where, upon return, the mother applied for sole care and control and for leave to relocate, both of which were granted. The Father appealed, but the appeal was dismissed. A key factor considered was the Joint Letter of Intention that parties had entered, that provided that in the event of relationship breakdown the mother’s intention was to return to the UK, and while this was not binding, it shed light on parties’ intentions. Another issue was well-settledness of the child. In a globalised world, the weight that is to be given to well-settledness depended on related circumstances, including how many years the child lived in that country, age of the child, whether the country was the family’s home for many years, and acknowledging the child’s ability to adapt to new environments given time and support. Showing relocation to be a necessity was not a requirement but should be considered amongst other factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     It was held in that case that refusing relocation would be to compel the mother to live indefinitely in a country which was not her home where her immigration status was tenuous. The loss of relationship with the left-behind parent was an unfortunate consequence and the trauma of such loss could be mitigated by a willingness and ability of both parties to support substantial access. An inability of relocation would potentially result in a transference of insecurity and negative feelings on to the child under her primary care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     However, in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>, relocation was not allowed. This was notwithstanding that the mother and father of the children were both Canadian citizens who were married in 2002 but relocated to Singapore and then moved to Bangkok for work in 2004 where the 2 children were born in 2006 and 2007, before returning to Singapore in 2008. Parties and the Children stayed in Singapore since then. The marriage broke down in 2011. The Court ordered joint custody and interim care and control to the mother. The High Court allowed the appeal of the father, disallowing relocation. The Court held that while a child’s welfare is closely linked to the primary caregiver, the wishes of primary caregiver were not decisive. A child would benefit from continuing to have a meaningful relationship with both parents and the potential loss of an opportunity to have a meaningful relationship the left behind parent had to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     In <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>, it was held that the mother displayed hostility to father and given the distance between Singapore and Canada, the existing good relationship between the children and the father would be undermined by relocation. The Court held that on scrutiny of the relocation plans, the motivation to move was to avoid unpleasantness of having to deal with the father rather than seeking emotional and psychological support. The Court further held that the children were young, and it was not appropriate to inflict this sense of displacement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In another case of <b><em>TAA v TAB </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a></b> (“<b><em>TAA v TAB</em></b>”), the High Court disallowed the relocation. The father of the children was a Singapore citizen, whereas the mother was an American citizen. They completed their divorce in Singapore and then the father who married a woman from Spain who had Singapore PR status applied to relocate the 3 children to Spain. In that case, the children had lived their lives in Singapore and the father did not have a concrete plan on relocation to Spain and would entail him finding a new job and the children adjusting to an environment where English was not the main language of communication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In yet another case of <b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b>, the mother, father and 2 children were Portuguese and Singapore PRs. After divorce, the mother had a new British partner and sought to relocate to the UK with the children, but the Children’s entire lives had been in Singapore. Hence, the relocation was not allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     I will now apply the legal principles as elaborated on in the above cases to this present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Who was the primary caregiver of the Children?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     To determine the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver, I, first, had to consider whom amongst the parents was the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In this case, while both Parties held jobs, it was clear that the Mother, was the primary caregiver for the Children, and the Father had sought sole care and control, largely to allow him to take back the Children from India if an order was made in his favour. There were hardly any arguments from the Father about how he was the one taking primary care of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Conversely, the Mother had breast fed each of the Children till age 1, was responsible for attending to their daily meals, cleaning and grooming. She was involved in the planning of their activities and was in charge of dropping off and picking the Children up from school, even while they were in Singapore. As the Mother described it, the general day-to-day decisions for the Children were largely made by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Thus, having determined the Mother to be the primary caregiver of the Children, had to consider what her reasonable wishes were and balance this off with the Children’s potential loss of relationship with the left-behind parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity &amp; Motive of Relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In this case, there was no immediate necessity for relocation. While the Mother was fully entitled to decide not to reside with the Father, living separately from the Father, did not require relocation to another country. The Mother was a Singapore PR, so her residency status was not in issue and she was well able to continue work in Singapore. In fact, as of the time of the decision, she had continued working for the Singapore multinational company whilst in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The above-mentioned factors were in favour of the Father’s position. However, as held in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> [at [67] to [69], necessity was not a requirement, and should be considered with other factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The Mother had explained that she wanted to extricate herself from the home environment and wanted to protect the Children from the Father’s alleged behaviour. The Mother had initially sought refuge at a friend’s home but had to leave and decided to go to Noida, India earlier than initially scheduled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     While Noida is not a location in India that Parties had spent significant time in before, this is where the Mother’s has family support had moved to and her extended family actively assist her in the care of the Children. So, in this case, it was not that the relocation was to avoid unpleasantness of having to deal with the Father rather than seeking emotional and psychological support, unlike in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     As the case law previously cited also suggests, the wellbeing of the Primary Caregiver is closely related to the wellbeing of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     Based on text messages exchanged between the Parties, it was explicit that the Mother was desirous of not staying in Singapore if Parties were to get a divorce, and she had already spent a stint of time in India with the Children and her family during an earlier period of separation. To order for the Children to be returned to Singapore would mean that the Mother would have to leave her family support system and return to Singapore, where she does not have a home to go to as the Father insisted on still residing there and she did not want to cohabit in the same home as the Father. Hence, the ordering of the return of the Children would present a logistical challenge and would strain parties’ finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The effect this would have on the Mother had to be taken into consideration as it could also adversely affect the care of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Connection to Singapore – were the Children well-settled in Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Next, I considered how well-settled the Children were in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     In this case, as stated above, the Father was a Singapore Citizen, and was also an Overseas Citizen of India with a USA Green Card. The Father was originally an Indian Citizen but gained citizenship after studying in Singapore sometime in 2005. Thereafter, the Father lived in the USA, Norway and London for significant stretches of time. The Mother was an Indian Citizen and a Singapore PR since 2013. This PR status was renewed in 2018 and was still valid as of the time of this reporting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Parties were married in Singapore in early July 2012, but conducted their ceremonies in India on the later part of July 2012. Parties had only been residing in Singapore from March to December 2012, before the Mother moved to the UAE and then both parties moved to the USA. Hence, substantially, the Parties had only been living together in Singapore for about 10 months before their return in April 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The Children were USA Citizens and Overseas Citizens of India and were originally only in Singapore under LTVPs that were valid till October 2023. However, after the Mother had left with the Children, the Father applied for and obtained Singapore PR statuses for the Children as of July 2023. The Father claimed that this was with the Mother’s consent, but the Mother has vehemently denied granting consent. Notably, Singapore PR status for the Children had only been applied for when Parties were not on good terms, and the Mother and the Children had left for India in November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Eldest Son who was 6 years old, was not born in Singapore but in the USA and remained there with his parents until he was about 3 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Parties relocated to Singapore in April 2020. This coincided with the Father finding new employment in Singapore. The Mother relocated but continued to work remotely for her USA company, but then transitioned to her current job with the Singapore multinational company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     It was undisputed that in 2021, the Matrimonial Home in Keppel Bay, Singapore was purchased where Parties and the Children resided at.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    But in July 2021, the Parties moved back to the Texas, USA for about 3 months for the birth of the Youngest Son who was born in late August 2021. Regardless of who had planned for this, going to Texas, US, was purposefully engineered for the Youngest Son to obtain USA Citizenship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    It is undisputed that between March and May 2022, the Parties were separated and the Mother and the Children had resided in India, albeit not Noida, for this period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    It is also undisputed that the Mother and the Children left for India on 21 November 2022, and have remained there since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    So, in summary, the Children had not spent much time living in Singapore:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_103-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Eldest Son had stayed in Singapore for about just under 2 years out of his 6 years of life (i.e. 9 months in 2020, 9 months in 2021, and 7 months in 2022); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_103-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Youngest Son had stayed in Singapore for about 10 months out of his 2 years of life (i.e. 3 months in 2021, 7 months in 2022).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>During such time, the Children were residing in Singapore only on an LTVP (Singapore PR status was only obtained after they had left Singapore).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    While enrichment programs were attended by the Eldest Son in Singapore, he had not entered into the formal Singapore school system. It was unclear if there was an intention to send him to local schools of international schools: the Father claimed he was considering local school, whereas the Mother was of the view that they were looking at international schools. Also, his kindergarten studies were disrupted by a 3-month travel to the USA for the birth of the Youngest Son. The Eldest Son had purportedly attended 4 different schools in the US, Singapore and India. The Youngest Son, at his young age, had not much of a social life in Singapore. I was also cognizant of the fact that in almost all of the audio recordings provided by the Father in support of his case, that the Eldest Son spoke primarily in Hindi, and not one of the 4 national languages of Singapore, to the Father and the Father also spoke largely Hindi with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Furthermore, while the Parties made connections with friends in Singapore, they appeared to mostly be of the expatriate community as seen by the persons that they got to file affidavits of support for each of their applications. Moreover, they had relocated in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic where there were restrictions, and the Father was unable to present sufficient evidence of the Parties and the Children having integrated into Singapore culture. In the circumstances, there was insufficient evidence to support the Father’s assertion that Singapore was the Children’s domicile or that they were well-settled in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    It is curious to note that the Children being born to a Singapore Citizen, would have normally availed them to the option of obtaining Singapore Citizenship, but such Singapore Citizenship was not pursued at any material point in time while the Parties were jointly residing in Singapore. The Father only belatedly sought, in OSG 8, an application seeking the authority to apply for Singapore citizenship for them without the Mother’s consent, which was also not allowed, given the ultimate decision reached and that the issue of citizenship being a major decision that the Parents with joint custody should reach a decision on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other factors relating to the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    As stated above in paragraph 72, <b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b> guides that the Court should consider the factors relating to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In this case, the Children have already undergone several changes in their young age, having relocated from the USA to Singapore and then spending a period of time in the USA and in India before remaining in India for the last 10 months in Noida prior to the decision. The Children being young would mean that they could very well adapt to a change in environment without significant difficulty. Based on the evidence provided, it appeared to suggest that the Children had grown largely accustomed to their living arrangements in Noida.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The Eldest Son had started primary schooling in Noida, in 2023, albeit by way of enrolment made by the Mother unilaterally. As opposed to kindergarten studies which were more flexible, for the Eldest Son to return to study in Singapore, this would be a tectonic shift in the education system, which must be given due consideration for the Children’s best welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    What appeared to be significant was that the Children have the support of the Mother’s parents in Noida, as well as the Mother’s sister and brother-in-law. The Mother’s family appear to be close-knit and the Children appear to be comfortable in their care. I have to acknowledge that the Children’s connection with the extended maternal family in Noida, India, was fairly significant. There also appears to be well-settled arrangements for the care of the Children and the education for the Children, particularly the Eldest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    Conversely, in Singapore, there were no further familial support systems, instead, the Father’s mother resides a few hours away from where the Mother resided. If the Mother were to be ordered to relocate with the Children back to Singapore, it is unclear where they would reside. The Father insisted on remaining in the Matrimonial Home and if the Mother refused to reside with him, this would entail her obtaining alternative accommodations in Singapore and also setting up wholly new arrangements for the care and education of the Children. This would be without the support of the Mother’s extended family who are in Noida, India. The Father did not provide any concrete plans for how such care could be effected in Singapore, save that he wanted to have care and control of the Children and that he would be assisted by a domestic helper for such care, while attending to his full-time work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    A factor that was of some concern was the effectiveness of ordering any interventions for the Children, if they were to remain in Noida, India. Counselling, and evaluation reports could only be done when the Children and Parties were largely physically in Singapore. Hence, if the Children were to remain outside of Singapore, that would be a limitation in the intervention that can be ordered. However, notably this was not one of the accepted factors for the Court to consider for relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    Notably, in the few cases cited where relocation was not allowed, a common factor was that there were no concrete plans on relocation, and it would entail significant upheaval for the Children. The proposed relocation in those cases also had little connection or significance for the children. Whereas in this case, there were already firm arrangements in place, and India had a significant connection to parties and the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Loss of Relationship to the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    If relocation were allowed to persist, it would invariably affect the Father’s relationship with the Children. While the regular virtual access had afforded the Father with some contact, physical access with the Children would be more substantial. While the Mother had offered to provide the Father with access in Noida, India, the Father was of the view that he would be at risk if he were to travel to India. The Father alleged that the Mother’s father had political ties and that he had encountered significant difficulties during an attempted access in May 2023, where the Indian Police had been called down, and he had to spend significant time in questioning. In this regard, while allegations were made and a video with transcripts provided showing a tense exchange between parties over who was able to spend time with the Eldest Son, I found that the Father’s assertions that he was unable to exercise access in Noida, India to be unsupported in evidence. In any event, the Father had decided not to have any further physical access until OSG 8 and 40 were fully determined. It is noted that after the order was made, the Father appears to have exercised regular access to the Children in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    While the Father being in a separate location from the Children, is a significant impediment to their bonding, this can be ameliorated with robust access arrangements including physical and virtual access. Both the Father and Mother were earning substantial income, and the Father’s travels to and from to Noida, India, while being an inconvenience, could be well managed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    Generally, it appeared that the Father still maintains a fairly good relationship with the Eldest Son despite the distance and the Father has also spent some time developing a relationship with the Youngest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Balancing the Considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    Hence, in favour of allowing relocation to Noida, India, to persist included:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Children’s lack of significant connection to Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother’s support systems in India and the Children’s well-settledness in India instead of Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the concrete plans which were already in place for the Children’s care in Noida, India instead of Singapore; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the primary caregiver’s relocation was based on reasonable reasons of family support and her wellbeing would affect the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    In favour of ordering a return of the Children to Singapore included:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the loss of relationship for the Father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_b\"></a>(b)     relocation was done unilaterally by the Mother and should not be condoned; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_c\"></a>(c)     there was no immediate necessity for relocation as Mother had PR status and the Children could reside in Singapore on LTVPs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    Overall, on balance, the Children’s lack of substantial connection to Singapore, the Mother’s support system in Noida, India, and the Children’s strong connection to the Mother’s extended family there and the concrete plans which have been effectuated, to me, presented as stronger factors showing that the Children’s best welfare was better served with allowing them to continue to reside with the Mother in Noida, India. While the Mother’s actions to unilaterally relocate the Children was wrong, ultimately the decision was reached on the Children’s best welfare and disapproval of the Mother’s actions can be achieved through the means of costs or other measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    In the circumstances, I allowed the Children to continue to reside in Noida, India and did not order for their return. However, given that the Mother had unilaterally relocated the Children, the Father should be compensated with costs, which is discussed subsequently in paragraphs 141 to 143.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 3: Care &amp; Control of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    With regard to the care and control of the Children, the Father had initially sought sole care and control but subsequently pivoted to consider shared care and control, whereas the Mother had also sought sole care and control to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Given the Children residing in Noida, India and the Father continuing to reside in Singapore, shared care and control across countries would be impractical. As stated above, it was clear that the Mother has and continues to be the primary caregiver of the Children. In the circumstances, there was no reason to not grant sole care and control of the Children to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 4: Education of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    The Father had expressed a desire for the Children to study in a Singapore Public School, whereas the Mother preferred for them to go to an international school. Given that that I allowed the Children to remain in Noida, India, I did not find any reason to disturb the current education arrangements. The Father also provided no alternative schooling options in India. However, as this matter was something that needed to be further determined in the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings, I reserved this for reconsideration at such time, when more complete evidence would be in place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 5: Access to the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    In relation to access, pursuant to the cases such as <b><em>BKJ v BKK </em></b><b>[2013] SGDC 26</b>, overnight access should be the default position unless there are strong grounds against it and the Courts should be slow to deny overnight access as it would be normally helpful for the development of the parent-child bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    In that case, District Judge Colin Tan had summarized the well-held principle that overnight access should be approached from the perspective of the child’s best welfare and the child’s rights to spend time with their respective parents. The child should be equally entitled to overnight access with the father as he is with the mother, unless there is evidence to disprove either party’s eligibility, such as a history of abusive or negligent parenting. Even though the child is asleep during a part of the overnight access, there is an intangible value of building up familiarity, being able to say good morning to or to have a particular storybook read by the parent before the child goes to bed, these are important opportunities to build bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    In the circumstances, I found not reason not to order for overnight unsupervised access with the Father for both of the Children, provided that the Father has another adult present with him, such as his mother. This is because there has not been cogent evidence provided that the Father was incapable of caring for a the children independently overnight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    While the Mother had raised certain concerns over the Father, there was no cogent evidence presented on how he was a risk to the Children. Additionally, she acknowledged that he was never physically abusive to the Children. In light of this, the norm of unsupervised overnight access was allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    Given the logistics of travel and the Father’s full time work, I ordered that the Father be able to have 2 weekends of access to the Children every month. As held in <b><em>BLD v BLE </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0333.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 333</a></b> (“<b><em>BLD v BLE</em></b>”) at [34], weekend time with school-going children is important and where the bulk of parent-child bonding takes place given the realities of modern life. So, the Mother should also have 2 weekends per month with the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    I did not grant any overseas school vacation access to the Father at this juncture, given the dispute between parties over where the Children should reside, but reserved it to be reconsidered in the ancillary matters for the Divorce Proceedings. The full terms of the access are described below in paragraph 140(d).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 6: Children Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    While both Parents are equally responsible for the maintenance of the Children, this may not translate in equal financial contributions. The sharing of this financial responsibility would correspond with their financial means and capacities. This position was affirmed in the recent decision of <b><em>WBU v WBT </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Income of Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    For the Mother, taking an average of her take home income for Year of Assessment (“<b>YA</b>”) 2022 and 2023 from her Notices of Assessment (“<b>NOAs</b>”) of:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_131-p2_a\"></a>(a)     YA 2022: 288,796 – 19,713 (CPF deduction) = S$269,083; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_131-p2_b\"></a>(b)     YA 2023: 228,761 – 18,279 (CPF deduction) = S$210,482.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Her average annual income works out to be S$239,782.50, which is a monthly average of S$19,981.88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    Even though the Father claimed he was earning less than the Mother, by averaging his income for YA 2021 and payslips for YA 2022 and YA 2023 (as these NOAs were not provided):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_a\"></a>(a)     YA 2021: 345,276 – 20,400 (CPF deduction) = S$24,876 annual income, and thus, a monthly average of S$27,073;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_b\"></a>(b)     YA 2022: 253,499.72 annual (after CPF deduction), and thus a monthly average of S$21,124.97; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_c\"></a>(c)     YA 2023: 232,364.65 annual (after CPF deduction), and thus a monthly average of S$19,363.72.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>His average monthly income amounted to S$22,520.56.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    However, I accepted the Mother’s point that if the Court were to observe the receipt of monthly salary into the Father’s bank account, his current salary would be S$27,103.24. This was the sum that the Father had been receiving regularly into his UOB account from January to June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    As briefly touched on, the Father failed to provide his NOAs for YA 2022 and 2023 (which would be income earned in 2021 and 2022), because they were purported unavailable. The Father’s narrative on this is put into serious question, when the disclosure was allowed as late as August 2023. It was quite unbelievable that the NOAs for the income earned for the previous year would not be ready as of such time. Even if the Father was disputing the assessment, he could have provided the disputed NOAs or his 1R8A Form for income tax, but he did not. Given that this regular monthly income received into his bank account does not even account for the average bonuses for the year, which I do not have insight into, I found it fair to consider the sum of S$27,103.24 to represent the Father’s most recent income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    In the circumstances, given their joint monthly income of S$47,085.12, their proportionate share of the joint income as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.96%\"><col

id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    In general, the Father’s estimates were significantly too low and not representative of what would be the Children’s reasonable expenses and some of the Mother’s claimed sums were largely inflated. For certain specific requests, I elaborate on why these sums were disallowed or reduced as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_a\"></a>(a)     given that the Mother and the Children were residing with the Mother’s parents, with no immediate plans to move to her own residence, no rental income has been incurred. In the circumstances, such claimed amount was not allowed at this juncture, and can be pursued for variation if there was a material change in circumstances, such as the Mother moving out with the Children to a new residence that she has to rent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the claimed fees for a domestic helper of S$1,355.20 a month was excessive for a family of 3, where there already is a cook, a nanny, a driver and a cleaning service engaged which were paid for by the Mother’s family. In the circumstances, I adjusted the sums down to a reasonable rate of S$750 per month, which was comparable to the costs of domestic helper and levy fee in Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_c\"></a>(c)     for the Youngest Son’s education, I note that they were not yet incurred, but were due to be incurred in a few short months. As such, given the imminent expenses, I allowed it on the basis the Youngest Son would either be in childcare or enrolled in school shortly; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_d\"></a>(d)     with regard to the registration fees this would not be a recurring sum, and as such, I excluded such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    Overall, I found the monthly expenses of S$4,538.61 per month to be reasonable for the 2 Children and commensurate with the lifestyle that the Parties ad previously been enjoying, particularly given their relatively substantial monthly income. I further found it fair to order that the Father bears a 58% share of such reasonable expenses, which amounted to S$2,632.39, but this was rounded up to S$2,7000 to take into account various miscellaneous fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    That would be a sum of S$1,350 per Child per month, which was well within each Parties’ means to afford. This was still the case, even when accounting for the Mareva Injunction imposed against the Mother in the Divorce Proceedings, which allowed her monthly withdrawals of S$8,000, and payment of her taxes and legal fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Full Order of Court</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    In the circumstances, having considered all these issues, I dismissed OSG 8, as the substantive issues of custody, care and control, access, child maintenance and relocation were instead dealt with in OSG 40.

However, as this was not previously raised before and no evidence had been led on this, I did not allow such a submissions at such a late stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    Separately, having delivered the decision at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing, I invited Parties to make arguments on the costs. The Mother submitted that she had incurred S$25,000 in legal fees thus far and was desirous of the Father paying her such costs. The Father estimated that he spent between S$40,000 to S$50,000 on legal fees in Singapore and another S$10,000 to S$15,000 in India (i.e. between S$60,000 and S$75,000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    While the Father was successful on the issue of joint custody, the Mother was successful on the significant issues of care and control and the relocation. For the access arrangements, it was a compromise between both sides’ positions and for Children Maintenance, both were far off the mark and the Court made an order that was in the middle ground. Overall, the Mother was more successful on the substantial points. While costs are usually only provided when parties had legal representation, both Parties had began with lawyers and both acknowledged that they sought legal advice of Singapore lawyers for the proceedings. In the circumstances, I was minded to allow costs of S$8,000 to take into account the amounts paid for disbursements and their seeking of legal advice, even though they were largely not legally represented in the hearings. However, I also had to take into account the fact that the Mother had unilaterally relocated the Children without submitting the disputed issue to the Court to determine the issue before taking further steps. In the circumstances, I found it fair to make no order as to costs, so as to indicate the Courts disapproval for such unilateral actions taken by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    I appreciated that both Parties had to grapple with complex legal issues as litigants in person after having discharged their lawyers. However, I would be remiss not to point out that even though both Parties did not have formal representation, they had acknowledged that they were receiving legal advice on the arguments in OSG 8 and 40. Having said that, both Parties were intelligent, well-spoken and did their best to argue their cases. They acquitted themselves nicely in their oral arguments but were, at times, unfocused and significant time had to be spent on procedural issues and refocusing them on the legal basis for certain arguments. While they had to be reminded about decorum on occasion, the oral submissions were largely civil even though the issues were hotly contested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    I did not come to my decision lightly, as I understood the significant repercussions that it would have on Parties and the Children as well as the extended family. As such, I gave both the Father and the Mother ample opportunities to address me on further evidence and submissions after raising my concerns with them, while also setting reasonable timeframes to ensure that decision was rendered within a fairly short time frame, taking into consideration the complexity of the issue sand the breadth of evidence provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    In my decision-making process, I had to consider the matter carefully and did go back and forth on the merits of each Parties’ cases. In the best case scenario, Parties should have been able to have civil discussions with each other to reach a consensus on such important issues for the Children, however, they were unable to do so and the Court thus had to intervene. Ultimately, I made the difficult decision on the various issues based on established case law and principles which puts the Children’s best welfare as the paramount consideration.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Relocation"],"date":"2023-11-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 5714/2016 (FC/SUM 1740/2023)","title":"WRT v WRU","citation":"[2023] SGFC 38","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30720-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in Person","Mr Ng Kiat Han (Advance Law LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2023-11-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>WRT v WRU</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WRT <em>v</em> WRU </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30720-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 38</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">D 5714/2016 (FC/SUM 1740/2023)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 November 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chia Wee Kiat </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in Person; Mr Ng Kiat Han (Advance Law LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WRT — WRU </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Relocation</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 November 2023</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Father” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Mother”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties were married on 26 March 2011 and have two children born to the marriage, [G] and [K].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> G turned 12 in September 2023 and K turned 10 in November 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Owing to parties’ irreconcilable differences, the Father filed for divorce on 25 November 2016 and Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 15 May 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The IJ was made final on 19 February 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 31 May 2023, the Mother filed FC/SUM 1740/2023, an application to vary the IJ to allow the children to relocate to the United States of America (“USA”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the hearing of the application on 17 August 2023, the Mother requested that I interview the children.

Although the legal principle is simple in concept, the challenge lies in its application to each unique case (see <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<em>TAA</em>”) at [7]). As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS</em> (at [2]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Cases of this nature are never easy to decide. As Mostyn J observed pithily in the English High Court decision of <em>Re AR (A Child: Relocation)</em> [2010] EWHC 1346 (Fam) at [4], “[t]hey involve a binary decision – either the child stays or he goes” and hence, whichever way the court decides, the decision is bound to cause considerable pain and anguish to one of the parties. The relocating parent will be aggrieved by a refusal of the application as that ostensibly ties him or her down, against his or her wishes, to an environment which he or she has little affinity towards. On the other hand, it is the left-behind parent who suffers if the relocation application is allowed because that naturally curtails not just the quantity but also the quality of that parent’s contact with the child (or children).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The welfare of the child involves a consideration of different factors. In <em>UFZ v UFY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a> (“<em>UFZ</em>”), Debbie Ong J provided the following guidance (at [8]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The inquiry of what is in the welfare of the child involves a consideration of a multitude of factors. Relocation applications involve one parent exercising his or her authority to relocate the child to another jurisdiction. Two important factors that will come into play will unsurprisingly be: (i) the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver; and (ii) the child’s loss of relationship with the ‘left-behind’ parent (<em>BNS</em> at [28]). These factors, amongst others, are pertinent in helping the court assess what the best interests of the child are. This assessment is “<b><em>an intensely fact-centric exercise</em></b>” [emphasis in original] (<em>BNS</em> at [28]) and will remain a very difficult one in all relocation cases. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As regards the weight to be given to the various factors, the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS</em> (at [22]) provided the following guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]here can be <em>no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy</em> among the many composite factors which may inform the court’s decision as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lie: where these factors stand in relation to one another must depend, in the final analysis, on <em>a consideration of all the facts in each case.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(1)   Reasonable wishes of primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As noted above, an important factor the court will consider in a relocation application is the reasonableness of the primary caregiver’s wishes to relocate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the present case, the Mother’s reason for relocation was her engagement with her fiancé B.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Mother wishes to move to the USA to be with B and has expressed her intention to marry him in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Although the Mother’s intended marriage to B will be her third one, her wish to move on to the next stage of her life is understandable. Afterall, the Mother is divorced from the Father. This is acknowledged as much by the Father who “wished her well in her new marriage”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     That said, the Mother’s relocation to the USA with the children will result in the physical separation of the children from the Father. Indeed, the same difficulty was noted in <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (at [18]) (“<em>UXH</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A divorced parent can certainly move on with life with a new partner. Indeed, there are many reconstituted families formed by divorced parties who move on to marry a second time, or even a third time. No difficulty in respect of a loss of relationship with a left-behind parent arises when the reconstituted family resides in the same country as the other parent. In the present case, however, the Mother’s wish directly affects the Father’s relationship with the Children because she and her partner have plans to relocate to the UK, which will result in physically separating the Children from the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In <em>UXH</em>, the court quoted with approval the following observation of the lower court (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… In my view, where relocation is a matter of choice, the reasonableness of the wish of the primary caregiver would have to be evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the children …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the present case, there is no evidence to suggest that the Mother cannot stay put in Singapore. The Mother and the children are all Singapore citizens. The Mother’s evidence that B “will have to leave his wonderful job in the USA to move to Singapore, if it is even allowed” suggests that she has not given sufficient consideration or seriously explored the alternative option of having B relocate to Singapore, which would be less disruptive to the stability that the children currently enjoy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It seems to me that the Mother’s decision to relocate is a matter of choice, and not borne out of necessity. That being the case, the reasonableness of the Mother’s wish will have to be evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(2)   Loss of children’s relationship with the Father </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As noted in <em>TAA</em> (at [19]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A relocation of children to another jurisdiction is a serious matter. It would mean a fundamental change in whom the children would see as their close family and the children would lose the experience of hands-on parenting from both their mother and their father (see <em>K v K</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 793). <b>The court must give sufficient weight to the loss of the children’s relationship with the left-behind parent</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In <em>BNS</em>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [25]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is axiomatic that a child benefits from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of <em>both</em> parents in his or her life and this does not cease to be true upon the breakdown of marriage. Relocation, however, represents a serious threat to this ideal state of joint parenting since the left-behind parent would, as its appellation suggests, become less of a presence in the child’s new life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Court of Appeal emphasised (at [26]) that although the loss to the child of his or her relationship with the left-behind parent is an important consideration, it is, like that of the wishes of the primary caregiver, not to be treated as having determinative weight or as being decisive in every case. How adversely the loss of that relationship will impact on the child’s welfare is a matter that depends on the facts, in particular, the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Court of Appeal elaborated further (at [26]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In general, the stronger the bond, the larger the resultant void in the child’s life if relocation is allowed, and, accordingly, the weightier this factor must be in the overall analysis. Indeed, it may <em>further</em> be appreciated that it is only when there is a <em>subsisting</em> relationship between the left-behind parent and the child that one can properly speak of there being a “<em>loss</em>” of that relationship upon relocation. As has been astutely contrasted in <em>Ong</em> at para 9.42, the severance of an already functioning (if not blossoming) relationship will generally be both more agonising and disruptive to the child than if the effect of relocation was, relatively speaking, merely to hamper the “<em>building</em>” up of that particular parent-child relationship:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">There is a difference between the trauma and harm to a child arising from the <em>loss</em> of a close relationship and the benefits of <em>building</em> a relationship with both parents. Where the relationship between the child and non-custodial parent is not close, it may still be beneficial for the law to support the maintenance of this relationship or encourage parties to strengthen the relationship. However, if this must be sacrificed because of pressing reasons for relocation, it may be the less harmful choice for the child. In contrast, where a <em>loss</em> of a close relationship is concerned, the harm to the child may not justify the sacrifice. [emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In the present case, the Mother contends that the relocation will not jeopardise the relationship between the Father and the children as the children have never been close to the Father even before the divorce. The Mother says that there were minimal interactions between the Father and the children ever since they were little and this has not changed to the present day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This is disputed by the Father.

When the Father asked the children where they stay, the children told him that “mummy say cannot let you know where we stay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> When the Mother found out that the Father knows where they stay, she confronted her own mother for telling the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I note that by the Mother’s own admissions, the Father has been exercising his access to the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, even if the Mother’s assertions are taken at face value, it cannot be said that there is no subsisting relationship between the Father and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Granted, the evidence before me suggests that there is a need to strengthen the relationship between the Father and the children. This is borne out as much by the evidence of the Father. However, as noted in <em>BNA</em>, where the relationship between the child and non-custodial parent is not close, it may still be beneficial for the law to support the maintenance of this relationship or encourage parties to strengthen the relationship. In my view, this factor is especially important in the present case given that there are no pressing reasons for relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The current bond between the children and the Father has weakened due to the ongoing conflict, but the relationship is salvageable with appropriate intervention and more opportunities of bonding and interactions between the children and the Father. The children are still young and would benefit from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of both parents in their lives. By relocating now, it would force an inevitable end to the relationship for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I note, in this regard, that similar concerns were expressed in <em>TAA</em> (at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Mother is now fighting to spend time with the children and rebuilding her relationship with them. She had been an involved parent until the marriage broke down. Whatever may have been the true state of the circumstances during the years 2009 to 2014, the difficulties during that time had caused issues between the Mother and the children such that they are no longer as close as they were prior to the marriage breakdown. In fact, there is tension in their relationship. Does this then mean that the mother-and-children relationship should never be supported any further? Are the children to simply live without their Mother in their lives from now on, erase the earlier childhood memories of their relationship with her and move on without their mother in their lives? The reality here is that when the Father and children relocate to Spain, the Mother's access to the children will be more difficult than ever before. The Father's position appeared to be that he could not do anything more to facilitate access if the children themselves did not want to see or talk to their Mother. There was no evidence of any discussion between the parents on the proposed move to Spain, nor on any arrangements on how access could continue when the children left for Spain in September. It is doubtful anything will improve in terms of greater encouragement and support for access by the Father when they live in Spain for the longer term. There is no evidence of efforts by the Father to be supportive of access; instead, there appears to be support for the children to write letters that they do not wish to spend time with the Mother. Thus, relocation to Spain is likely to sound a death knell to the relationship between the Mother and the children. If the children remain in Singapore, their relationship with their Mother could get better, or it might not. Life is not predictable. But relationships are dynamic and it would be a disservice not to give the children the opportunity of building a positive relationship with their mother. The father is also obliged by the law to be a cooperative parent, to actively support the building of the relationship, for this is in the welfare of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(3)   Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Mother submits that the children have often expressed their wishes to relocate to the USA.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     However, as acknowledged by the Mother herself,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> the children’s wishes, while relevant, are not determinative. In <em>TQ v TR</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) 971 (at [20]), for example, although the son had expressed his wish to study in the Netherlands, the Court of Appeal decided that it would be best, having regard to all the circumstances, that he remain in Singapore with the Mother, instead of returning to the Netherlands with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Similarly in <em>VDU v VDT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24096-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 15</a>, in response to the mother’s submission that the access terms must accord with the children’s wishes, i.e., that the father should not be allowed access to the children if the children did not want to meet him, the court expressed the following concerns:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is in the best interests of a child for him to maintain links with both of his parents (see <em>UYK v UYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24728-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 9</a> at [65]). The Children, being young, may not appreciate the importance of maintaining the links with the Husband, and thus it is not in their best interest to allow the Husband access only when the Children feel like meeting him. Moreover, the Husband has moved out of the Matrimonial Home and away from the Children since as early as 2012. The Children would thus have necessarily became somewhat estranged from the Husband, and there is a real possibility that the Children would be unwilling to meet with him. In the circumstances, to subject the Husband’s access to the Children’s wishes would not help improve their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, the children’s wishes must be viewed against the fact that they are still young and may not fully appreciate the importance of maintaining their links with both parents and the significance of the loss of relationship with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Furthermore, the relocation to the USA calls for major adjustments. For the Mother, this would be her third marriage, but first cross cultural marriage, leaving a familiar environment that she has lived for more than 40 years to relocate to a new country with no social support except the new husband and his family. For the fiancé, this would be his first marriage, and a first to a Singaporean divorcee with two pre-teens. Aside to adjustments for new marriages, he will have to deal with cross culture issue, and new experience not just as a parent, but a “step” parent to two pre-teen daughters from different culture. For the children, they will have to be uprooted from a familiar environment to a new environment with little family and social support. Apart from having to adapt to a reconstituted family, they will have to adapt to a new environment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While the Mother has brought the children for holiday to the USA to experience how it is like to stay in the USA, the impact of relocation vis-à-vis a temporary vacation is different (see <em>WNO v WNP</em> [2023] SGCF 19 (at [47]). It would not be wise to expect the children to fully appreciate the impact of the relocation at such young age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     To reiterate, the welfare principle of the child is paramount and this principle overrides any other consideration. As the Mother has the real option of staying in Singapore and the relocation if allowed would result in the children’s loss of relationship with the Father, I do not find the wish to relocate to be a reasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Moreover, there is no presumption at law in favour of relocation even if the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is not unreasonable. As noted in <em>UXH v UXI</em> (at [11]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… While the wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, the court must determine if those wishes are incompatible with the interests of the child; where they may not be compatible, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own (<em>TAA</em> at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Balancing all factors, I do not find the Mother’s wish to relocate to the USA to be compatible with the best interests of the children at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     While I understand that the Mother will likely be disappointed by my decision, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own. As noted in <em>TAA</em> (at [20]), a refusal to allow relocation at the time of application does not necessarily mean that a future relocation can never be possible. When circumstances have changed such that it is clear that relocation is in the best interests of the children, the Mother can always renew her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Keeping the status quo for now will provide for stability and continuity of care for the children, and an opportunity for the relationship between the Father and the children to be repaired and strengthened. It will also allow for the children to adjust to a newly reconstituted family within a more stable and familiar environment. The Mother can plan trips to the USA to give the children more exposure and experience of living in the USA, without the need disrupt the stability that the children currently enjoy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For the above reasons, I dismissed the application with no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As it was clear to me that there are co-parenting issues that need to be addressed, I encouraged the Mother and Father to seek help from a psychologist or counsellor experienced in parent-child issues who can assist them to implement a workable co-parenting system that will protect the relationships of the children with significant adults. I also encouraged the Father to acquire the skills and necessary insights that will help him engage the children at a pace they are comfortable with and strengthen the parent-child bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Notwithstanding the Mother’s decision to appeal against my decision, it is my hope that both parties would take immediate steps to improve their co-parenting relationship which is essential to the wellbeing of the children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note:

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Mother of 2 children applied for maintenance from the Father. After a hearing, I ordered the Father to pay to the Mother a monthly sum of $1,000 for each child as well as 50% of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father appeals against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother and the Father are undergoing divorce proceedings between each other. They have 2 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The children are a pair of twins aged 3 years old. They are in preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2022, the Mother filed divorce proceedings against the Father in Dxxx/2022. In response, the Father filed a counterclaim against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother and Father were living separately. The matrimonial home was sold, and the Mother went to live with another man. The Mother has a third child, which is not a child of the Father. The 2 children in question are living with her on most days, and with the Father from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother filed the present summons for maintenance of the children on 12 April 2023. In her complaint form in support of her application, the Mother claimed $3,508.31 for each child. The case came for mention on 22 May 2023, and there was no settlement between the parties. Directions were given to them to submit their documents and to return for a further mention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the meantime, the divorce proceedings separately underwent mediations in the Court. On 22 June 2023, there was an agreement on some matters, but when the present maintenance summons came before me, the parties disputed about the agreement. The Father claimed that interim maintenance for the children was agreed to be $300 a month for each child and half of the children’s school fees. The Mother claimed that there was no resolution or agreement on the children’s monthly maintenance, but only an agreement that their school fees would be shared with the Father equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the time of the hearing of the maintenance case before me in October 2023, there was as yet no interim judgment dissolving the couple’s marriage, nor was there any consent order on any ancillary issue entered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Mother argued that the Father ought to pay $1,200 a month for each child. This is in addition to the already agreed half of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father’s response was that he ought to pay $300 a month instead, in addition to the agreed half of school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Issues to be determined</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there was an agreement between the parties during the mediation of Dxxx/2022, that the Father was to pay $300 a month for the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     What were the reasonable expenses of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     What share of the children’s maintenance ought to be borne by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The agreement alleged by the Father was not evidenced by anything other than his allegation. One would expect that such an agreement would be evidenced by letters from his lawyer, but the Father did not show any such evidence. Neither was there a consent order to reflect such an agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I found that on a balance of probabilities, the Father did not prove the existence of such an agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the hearing before me, the Mother claimed that the children’s expenses were $2,000 each (Notes of Evidence, Page 12, line 2). She asked for the Father to contribute $1,200 for each child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father argued that the Mother was inflating what she claimed as expenses. He argued that $300 for each child was fair as he was paying more in terms of school fees and enrichment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The law does not require that every item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as in a reimbursement exercise. Important factors in determining the children’s maintenance are their needs and the financial capacity of the parents to provide for them – <u>UEB v UEC</u> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother was an assistant project accounting manager. Her monthly income is $7,300. She had some credit card with only a few hundred dollars of debt each. As she has an additional child which is not the Father’s, and she spends several hundred dollars on the expenses of the said child. I was conscious that the Father did not have to contribute to the expenses of this child. The Mother presently lives in her partner’s flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father is a finance manager. His monthly income was $7,373. He did not have any debts. He lived with his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I found that both the Mother and the Father had incomes of roughly $7,000 a month each. They were both well-educated and in stable employments. They had equal earning capacities and equal means to pay towards the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Taking into account the children’s needs and the parents’ financial capacities, I accept that each child’s monthly expense was $2,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I therefore found that the Father ought to bear half of the children’s expenses, or $1,000 a month for each child, totalling $2,000 a month for their maintenance. I also found that this amount was well within his means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the foregoing reasons, I ordered that the Father bear half of the monthly expenses of each child, at $1,000 each. As already agreed by the parties, I ordered that the Father bear half of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother did not request for the maintenance order to be backdated, so I made no such order.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Custody – care and control","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife","Family Law – Maintenance – Husband"],"date":"2024-01-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 399 of 2022","title":"WAH v WAG","citation":"[2024] SGFC 6","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30974-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in person","Ms Hing Wei Yuen Angelina and Mr Denny Lin DianYan (Integro Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2020-12-31T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>WAH v WAG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WAH <em>v</em> WAG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">D 399 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 January 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chia Wee Kiat </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in person; Ms Hing Wei Yuen Angelina and Mr Denny Lin DianYan (Integro Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WAH — WAG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Custody</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">care and control</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Husband</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 January 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff (the “Husband”) and the defendant (the “Wife”) were married on 4 February 2018. The Husband is a practicing lawyer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and the Wife is an auditor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The parties have a young child, [E], who is 5 years of age this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 27 January 2022. The Wife filed her Defence and Counterclaim on 17 February 2022. On 30 June 2022, Interim Judgment of Divorce (“IJ”) was granted based on both parties’ unreasonable behaviour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       At the ancillary matters (the “AM”) hearing on 4 July 2023, I gave directions for parties to file a Joint Summary and called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 1 December 2023, I rendered my decision with brief written grounds. As the Wife has appealed against part of my decision, I now provide my full grounds of decision incorporating my brief grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody, care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings, the parties had each taken out cross-applications under s 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (“the OSG applications”) against the other. The procedural history of the parties’ litigation is set out in my decision in <em>WAG v WAH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27153-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 17</a> (“<em>WAG v WAH</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The OSG applications culminated in my order dated 24 November 2021 (the “OSG order”) which provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that parties shall have joint custody of the child and that with effect from 27 June 2022, the Husband shall have unsupervised overnight access on the weekend from Friday 6pm to Sunday 11am. The parties’ cross-appeals against my decision were dismissed by Choo Han Teck J on 28 April 2022: see <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27460-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 9</a> (“<em>WAH v WAG</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Subsequent to the OSG order, I made further orders on 10 March 2023 (the “10 March order”) pursuant to the parties’ cross-applications <em>vide</em> FC/SUM 3869/2022 and FC/SUM 151/2023 filed in the divorce proceedings. The 10 March order was concerned mainly with pre-school matters and does not affect the access arrangement stipulated in the OSG order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband also filed FC/SUM 1112/2023 (“SUM 1112”). This is an application, which, according to the Husband, “relates to parents keeping each other updated reasonably quickly when E is unwell”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As the AM orders are final orders (see <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [9] &amp; [16])), SUM 1112 was considered holistically under the AM hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In broad terms, the Husband is seeking joint custody, care and control of E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Husband wants E to be within the care and control of one parent from Saturday 9pm to Wednesday morning while the other parent will have the remaining time with E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband says that the OSG order has been intact since 24 November 2021. Approximately 18 months thereon, he has not missed one access session. This amounts to approximately 72 weekends. There were 5 weekends where access was denied because the Wife deemed E ill.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband says that even though the Wife has been tacitly alienating E from him,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> he has bonded well with E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband says that E has expressed that he wants to spend more time with him. E has informed the Husband that he wants the Husband to pick him up and drop him off at school like other fathers who drop and pick up his friends. The Husband says that he too wants to be a part of E’s school life as it is and will continue to be a significant influence in E’s life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband acknowledges that both parents share a strong love for E. The Husband says that he is a sole proprietor and can manage his time accordingly while the Wife appears to still be able to work from home. The Husband says that both have a support system that supplements their immediate care giving abilities.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband says that the two nights of access spanning the weekends has not disrupted E’s development and there are no adverse reports by the Wife from the school that E is unable to cope. On the contrary, E is growing steadily at school and has become focused since the beginning of 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband says that the court can put in place several orders to facilitate cooperative co-parenting<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and should not allow the Wife to use acrimony for the self-serving position to prolong sole care and control and minimize progressive co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband says that he does not seek to reverse care and control as such a request may be too drastic for the Wife to bear, given her emotional attachment to E. However, to not make changes to the care and control facet of the interim orders would effectively reward the Wife and embolden her behaviour towards co-parenting, thereby depriving the child of what is in his best interests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s detailed proposals for access are set out at paragraph 4 of his Written Submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Wife’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife says that after the OSG order, she has been doing her utmost to abide by the orders. As such, the framework set out in the OSG order has been working relatively well under the circumstances in supporting the child’s safety, well-being and development. The OSG order has provided a firm and secure scaffold for the child’s growth under her care and control as the primary caregiver of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife is not in favour of shared care and control. She explains that the marriage has been extremely acrimonious, with legal proceedings lasting much longer than the length of the marriage itself. During the marriage, she was always the first one to want to resolve the issue, try to talk things out calmly and be prepared to forgive and forget. Even after the marriage had broken down, the Wife continued being the one trying various ways to urge the Husband to minimise acrimony. The Wife says that the Husband would case-build to show a “Sterling outlook” in court litigation while giving her “hell” by continually making harassing calls and emails during his access time so that he can turn round and accuse her of not responding to him or not co-parenting with him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife says that the Husband would openly quote excerpts of Court Order and Grounds of Decision where it suits him to intimidate, bully and humiliate her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife says that the Husband has been filing numerous applications to prolong litigation and increase legal fees for the Wife, and has refused to resolve matters amicably.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> For example, the Husband has sought to impose extremely prescriptive orders in SUM 1112<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and refused to return the child after access so as to put the Wife under duress to get the Wife to agree to his demands.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife says that she, on the other hand, has been doing her utmost to put the past behind her and parent the child as best as she can. She has been doing her utmost to comply with the Court’s orders, despite it being extremely challenging.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife says that the child was often returned back (and often late) from his access from the Husband sick, resulting in the Wife having to bear the aftermath caregiving, which adversely affects the rest of the weekdays under the Wife’s care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife says that the Husband is busy with work, and does not have support from his family members. The child is young and susceptible to falling sick. The refusal of the Husband to acknowledge this, and his constant clamoring for more time with the child as a matter of right, is not in the interests of the child, or the co-parenting relationship with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife says that while she has been trying her best efforts to continually affirm joint custody, this is not the case for the Husband. The Husband’s conduct has deeply eroded any trust she has left, and instead of repairing it, the Husband continues to ravage through whatever little of it is left.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife submits that given parties’ relationship is highly acrimonious, it is clearly not in the child’s best interests that shared care and control is ordered in this case.

The current OSG order as it stands basically only gives the Wife a few hours in the day on Sunday. The Wife says that this is clearly insufficient for the Wife and her extended family to spend quality time with the child over the weekends which will impact the bonding and development of the child over an extended period of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife says that there is no opportunity for the Wife to bring the child for any activities, which may include movies, family get-togethers, with the child’s extended family. The Wife is also unable to schedule any trips to Sentosa, the Zoo, etc. with the child during her time with him. These activities often would be whole-day activities and the child would be extremely tired at the end of the day. The Wife says that most parents would have such activities on a Saturday so that the child can rest and recover and be ready for school on Sunday. The Wife would like to be able to do this once a fortnight.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife hopes that the Court would grant the Wife an apportionment of the prime weekend time which includes one non-school night to spend with the child so that the Wife is also given the fundamental opportunity to bond with the child as well as to allow the child to visit with the maternal extended family during the weekends. The Wife is a working mother and weekend time with the child is precious to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     A summary of the Wife’s proposals for access is set out at paragraph 82 of her Written Submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Welfare of child </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It is trite law that in deciding on custody, care and control issues, the court must regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration: see s 125(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The principles of law on custody are well settled. Generally, joint or no custody orders should be made, with sole custody orders being an exception to the rule. As explained by the Court of Appeal <em>in CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the making of joint or no custody orders reminds the parents that the law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the child’s best interest. With the grant of joint or no custody orders, the likelihood of the non-custodial parents being excluded from the child’s life is much reduced. It also encourages the parent who does not reside with the child to continue to play his or her role in joint parenthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, I am heartened to note that the parties have agreed to joint custody. This is a positive shift from the litigious position taken in the earlier OSG proceedings where the Wife had sought strenuously for a sole custody order: see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [127]). I commend the Wife for taking this positive step towards co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I am also heartened to note that the parties have responded well to the framework set out in the OSG order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I find it especially encouraging to see that the Wife is no longer objecting to overnight access, but seeks only to have an apportionment of the prime weekend time, which is not an unreasonable request by itself. This is a positive development from the intractable position she took in the earlier proceedings: see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [156]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The central issue before me at this ancillary hearing is whether it would be in the best interests of the child for the care arrangement to progress to one of shared care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As noted in <em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 1 SLR 0840.xml')\">[2012] 1 SLR 840</a> (at [9]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances. This is illustrated by two High Court decisions where shared care and control was ordered: in <em>AHJ v AHK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0148.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 148</a> the child would spend Saturdays 8.00pm to Wednesday 11.30am with the mother, and the rest of the week with the father; in <em>AKF v AKG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0225.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 225</a> the same learned judge held that the children would spend alternate fortnights with each parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband has had unsupervised overnight parenting time (from Friday 6pm to Sunday 11am) with the child since June 2022. The Husband would like to seek more parenting time with the child. He has proposed a balanced sharing of parenting time through a half-week arrangement. However, the Wife objects to shared care and control. She has instead proposed for the Husband’s weekend parenting time with the child to be reduced so that she could bond with the child on weekends too.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The primary reason relied upon by the Wife to resist shared care and control is the acrimonious relationship of the parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> She submits as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">70    In the case of <em>TAU v TAT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a></em>, the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong held at [12], that to ignore the realities such as parental conflict, parties’ emotional baggage by imposing shared care and control can do more harm than good. Justice Ong further held at [29] that shared care and control of the child would not be workable because of the acrimonious relationship between the parties as well as their very different parenting styles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">71    In the case of <em>AQL v AQM <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a></em>, the High Court held at [14]-[21] that an order for shared care and control was not in the interests of the child as it would be too disruptive to constancy of routine that the child required and the animosity between the parents and their resulting inability to compromise would also exacerbate the sense of disruption.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     However, I note that in the recent decision of <em>CXR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a> (“<em>CXR v CXQ</em>”), the court made an order of shared care and control notwithstanding the acrimonious relationship of the parties and their inability to co-parent effectively. Debbie Ong JAD explained (at [18]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>I was acutely cognisant of the parties’ acrimonious relationship and their present inability to co-parent effectively.</b> I was equally aware that both parents love C dearly and had been giving their best efforts to care for him and help him cope with his medical condition and learning disabilities, albeit in their own ways. As C was living with both parents in the matrimonial home, he was accustomed to the arrangements and was close to, and dependent on both parents. While there were difficulties in cooperating on matters relating to C in the past few years, the parties were also able to sort out many care aspects including having C travel with his father. C has had the physical presence and care of both parents in his life even after the marriage had broken down. In the circumstances, I was of the view that parties should share care and control of C, but it is crucial that they must have in place a clear routine and structure that would enable C to have a stable and predictable arrangement. This arrangement placed the best interests of C at the forefront.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Quite clearly, the parties’ acrimonious relationship or inability to co-parent effectively are not reasons by themselves to refuse shared care and control. Ultimately, the question to be considered in each case is whether shared care and control would be in the child’s best interests and this must be assessed based on the specific facts of the case. Indeed, this is also clear from a careful reading of <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a>, a case precedent cited by the Wife, where Debbie Ong J (as she then was) said (at [12]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As I have explained above, the legal constructs of custody, care and control, and access are used to support families where the child’s parents have separated. Intact, functioning families do not need such interventions. The ideal state is understandably for a child to be in an intact family where he or she lives with and is lovingly cared for jointly by both parents. Yet, upon the breakdown of a marriage, this is simply no longer fully achievable. The family justice system nevertheless aspires to achieve the ideal state of affairs for the child, or the closest to it possible. But to ignore the realities, including the parental conflict, the parties’ emotional baggage and the new dynamics of the various relationships, and impose in all situations a modified version of the perceived ideal (such as equal-time shared parenting or shared care and control) can do more harm than good. <b>Thus in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife also contends that the child should primarily stay with her due to his established weekday routine, proximity to preschool (five minutes’ walk), and the need to maintain consistency to prepare the child for kindergarten in 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Wife says that night sleep is very important for a growing and developing child. In her view, it is clearly not in the child’s interests to have a shorter sleep time on Thursday night or have a longer commute on Friday mornings just to get to school on time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> If the child does not receive adequate rest on Thursday night, he would be tired and lethargic in his pre-school and this would affect his focus and concentration in school on Friday. Additionally, if the child does not get adequate rest on Thursday night, he may not be able to be punctual for his morning classes/activities on Friday and then this would mean that his development in school would be affected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In the interests of the child, the Wife hopes to avoid constant upheaval in access arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife also says that the current orders as they stand do not allow her and her extended family to spend any quality time with the child over the weekends and this will impact the bonding and development of the child as they will not be able to carry out any activities together over the weekends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The current orders also accord both non-school nights (Friday and Saturday) to the Husband. There is therefore no opportunity for the Wife to equally share in any of the non-school nights. The Wife says that all the nights that she currently has with the child would be school nights where the child would have a full day and be required to rest early in preparation for school the next day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife therefore proposes an equal sharing of the weekends for the child to bond with her and the maternal family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Notably, the Wife did not propose any make up access for the Husband. The effect of the Wife’s proposal is therefore to roll back on the access that has been in place since June 2022 pursuant to the OSG order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my view, the Wife’s contentions overlook the child’s socioemotional development. They do not consider the child’s relationship with the Husband, the importance of shared parenting, and the potential benefits of spending time with both parents for the child’s overall development and well-being. A child-centric arrangement should prioritize the child’s well-being and the opportunity to maintain meaningful relationship with both parents, rather than solely focusing on convenience, routines and the wish of one parent to have more time with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the OSG proceedings, I reminded parties that the child is young and will benefit from regular interaction and close physical contact with both parents. I referred parties to <em>BNT v BNS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0187.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 187</a> where Judith Prakash J noted (at [35(b)]) as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child – there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I also referred to <em>VDZ v VEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25178-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 858</a> where the Court of Appeal noted (at [79]) as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Every child requires love and care from <em>both</em> parents in order to grow up and achieve their fullest potential as balanced individuals</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     At the OSG proceedings, I found that the bond between the Husband and the child needed to be restored and strengthened as the Husband’s physical contact with the child had been adversely affected by the Wife’s action to restrict access. I explained as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The objective evidence shows that the Father has a close relationship with the child. He has been an intimate part of the child’s life since the child was born. The child is familiar with the Father, the paternal family and the environment in Home A. It is not disputed that the Mother left Home A with the child and restricted access to the Father. Whatever her justification may be, the effect of her action is that the physical contact between the Father and the child has been affected. It is the interests of the child that the bond between the Father and the child be restored and strengthened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Although the Husband had sought shared care and control at the OSG proceedings, I decided then that it would be preferrable for the child to continue staying with the Wife to maintain stability in his routine and living arrangements, but at the same time increase the access for the Husband to spend more quality bonding with the child. I indicated that after the child adjusts to the changes, it would be beneficial for the child to have longer duration of access with the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     At the time of my decision in the OSG proceedings, the Husband had been exercising access to the child three times a week since my interim order dated 14 January 2021 made earlier in the same proceedings. I found that it would be in the interests of the child to commence overnight access with effect from the week beginning 3 January 2022 on the weekend from Friday 6pm to Saturday 6pm. This would provide opportunities for the child to bond with the Husband and paternal family members over a longer period of time. It would also reduce the frequency of handovers and the risk of conflict escalation in the presence of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In addition, I provided a step-up access plan for one more overnight on Saturdays starting from the week commencing 27 June 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The child has adjusted well to the changes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Having regard to all the circumstances including the CER, I found that it would be beneficial for the child to transit to a shared parenting arrangement where he resides with each parent on an alternating week schedule from Friday 4pm to the following Friday 4 pm. Increasing the child’s time with the Husband would help strengthen his bond with the Husband and allow him to experience consistent and positive interactions. At the same time, the alternating week arrangement would give the Wife an equal opportunity to bond with the child over the weekend and should go some way towards assuaging her other concerns. To avoid issues of any parent returning the child late, each parent will pick the child from school on Friday 4 pm (or when formal lessons end) at the start of their alternate-week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In my brief grounds, I reminded parties once again that parental responsibility includes supporting the child’s relationships with both parents: see <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [87]). As noted in <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parental responsibility is a legal duty to be discharged by both parents. A strong parent is one who can support the child in having a close relationship with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     A party who makes a unliteral decision to deny the other parent their parenting time with the child would be acting in breach not only of the court orders, but also of their parental responsibility. I would encourage both parents to carry out the orders made with a supportive and cooperative spirit. In the unfortunate event that a parent is denied parenting time as a result of the unilateral decision of the other party, the affected parent shall be entitled to make-up parenting time. Parties should always endeavour to resolve any such dispute amicably before resorting to litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I made the following orders:</p> <p

that good sense would prevail, and they would have the fortitude to bring out the best version of themselves to make the shared parenting arrangement work. I was particularly heartened, in this regard, to see a more conciliatory and enlightened approach taken by the Wife in these proceedings, compared to the hard and unreasonable stance she took in the OSG proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is therefore disappointing that after my decision was rendered, the Wife filed Notice of Appeal against the shared care arrangement and consequential orders, and applied for stay of execution. This was despite my earlier advice to parties in the OSG proceedings (see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [7]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is my hope that the parents would carry out the orders made with a supportive and cooperative spirit. However, both parties have filed appeals to press on with the litigation. That is of course their prerogatives as litigants, but it would also mean that the conflicts between the parents will continue to fester, and this cannot be good for the well-being of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It is worthwhile to reiterate that parental responsibility is not just a personal responsibility which involves the parents’ time and personal sacrifices, but also a legal responsibility.

This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements”: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<em>TAU</em>”) (at [10]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For reasons set out in separate grounds issued to parties on 24 January 2024, I dismissed the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Section 112(10) of the Charter provides the definition of “matrimonial asset”. Matrimonial assets (“MAs”) include assets which were “acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage”: s 112(10)(b) of the Charter.

This was reiterated in the recent decision of <em>CXR v CXQ</em> where Debbie Ong JAD (at [26]) noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2020 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) provides the court the ancillary power, upon a grant of divorce, to divide the matrimonial economic gains of the marriage. Assets acquired <em>during</em> marriage by either party’s <em>efforts</em> are quintessential matrimonial assets subject to division. Assets acquired before the marriage may be subject to the division exercise if they were substantially improved during the marriage by the other spouse or by both spouses, or if they were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. On the latter, such “use” must be relatively prolonged rather than casual (<em>USB v USA</em> at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Wife says that she moved back to RP1 with E in November 2019 when both she and the Husband were already facing numerous problems and the marriage had already severely broken down.

spouse during the period: <b>(a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded</b>. We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) <b>the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives.</b> The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full.

It may also not involve a non-disclosure. Instead, this category may be seen to encompass a disposition of matrimonial assets <b>during the relevant period</b> when one spouse has failed to obtain the other’s consent, even for “innocent” reasons, as illustrated in the hypothetical example above. Adding a sum back into the pool on the basis of the <em>TNL dicta</em> does not rest on the making of an adverse inference in the way we have described at [18] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In my judgment, the sum of $200,000 should be added back to the asset pool on the basis of the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     As regards the monies in POSB Account No ~ 491-4, the Wife says that the monies belong solely to her mother.

In this regard, it would be helpful for parties to pay heed to the astute advice of the Court of Appeal in <em>UYQ v UYP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24104-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 3</a> (at [4]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In our view, it would assist the parties to find a way forward and put this painful chapter of their lives behind them by focusing on the <b><em>major details</em></b> as opposed to every conceivable detail under the sun. We caveat that this does not mean parties should swing to the other extreme by being remiss in submitting the relevant records. Put simply, there ought to be <em>reasonable accounting rigour that eschews flooding the court with details that would obscure rather than illuminate</em>. Henceforth, therefore, courts should discourage parties from applying the <em>ANJ v ANK</em> approach in a rigid and calculative manner. Parties would do well to understand that such an approach <b><em>detracts</em></b> from their respective cases instead of enhancing them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    As also

In <em>UZN v UZM</em>, the Court of Appeal set out at [18] (citing <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [60]) that an adverse inference may be drawn where:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a <em>prima facie</em> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    The Wife says that the Husband had access to the information he is hiding with regards to his business. There is also a substratum of evidence that the Husband has undisclosed stream of income revenue and assets in the business which he had not provided full and frank disclosure. The Husband had refused to declare the revenue generated by the business nor furnished the accounts from the business, including its Profit and Loss and business revenue. Further, the Husband has informed the Court at pre-trial conferences as well as in evidence that he is busy with numerous trials which would generate substantial revenue (all of which remains undeclared).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_95\" id=\"Ftn_95_1\"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> The Wife contends that it is clear that the Husband’s business has value while the Husband asserted it to be $0. The Wife submits that an adverse inference of 10% uplift should be drawn against the Husband to divide the known MAs in just and equitable proportions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_96\" id=\"Ftn_96_1\"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    The Husband says that he has accounted for the value of his business in the interim maintenance application FC/SUM 816/2022 (“SUM 816”) by pegging his last salary to that in the 2019 NOA, i.e., $110,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_97\" id=\"Ftn_97_1\"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> However, I do not find this to be a satisfactory response to his obligation to make full and frank disclosure of accounts relating to the business which is a matrimonial asset. The value of his business should not be conflated with the salary that he receives from the business. Without the proper accounts or a valuation report, it would not be possible to determine the value of his business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    For the above reasons, I am of the view that an adverse inference is warranted for the Husband’s failure to provide full and frank disclosure of accounts relating to his business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Giving effect to adverse inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    As noted in <em>TYS v TYT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20112-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 7</a> (“<em>TYS v TYT</em>”) (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The means by which an adverse inference may be given effect is fact-specific, including “by ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets to the other party, or, where possible, [by determining] the actual value of the undisclosed assets based on available information, and include such value in the pool of assets to be divided” (<em>Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0402.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 402</a> at [21])</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    At [45], the court stated further as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As explained earlier, I decided to use the uplift approach to address the adverse inference because it was not practicable to come to a finite sum for the Husband’s non-disclosure. The cases adopting an uplift approach cover a broad range of facts. In <em>Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53817-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 150</a>, the High Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In <em>Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0875.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 875</a>, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% of all the remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was separately divided. While the general uplift approach may be criticised as being arbitrary since there is no objective value to which it may take reference (<em>AZZ v BAA</em> at [120]), I considered that some <b>degree of arbitrariness was inevitable as adverse inferences were drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information</b>, and discarding the uplift approach entirely may create a perverse incentive for parties to tactically craft non-attributable non-disclosure. In the final analysis, much would depend on the facts, and in determining the appropriate uplift, the court will be guided by, <em>inter alia</em>, the evidence before it as to the extent of non-disclosure relative to the value of the disclosed assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    In the present case, without proper accounts or a valuation report, it would not be practical to ascribe a finite sum to the business. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against the Husband by ordering a larger proportion of the disclosed assets to the Wife. As noted in <em>TYS v TYT</em>, some degree of arbitrariness is inevitable as adverse inferences are drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information. Having regard to all the circumstances, I award an uplift of 10% to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Final ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Taking into account the uplift of 10% awarded to the Wife, the final ratio between the Husband and the Wife is tabulated as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"36.627325465093%\"><col width=\"32.7065413082617%\"><col width=\"30.6661332266453%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HUSBAND</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WIFE</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Direct Contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">20.73% </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(weighted: 14.51%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">79.27%</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(weighted: 55.49%)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Indirect contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">40</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(weighted: 12%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">60</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(weighted: 18%)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Average percentage contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">26.51%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">73.49%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Uplift </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">10%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Final ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">16.51%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">83.49%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    So that parties can move on amicably, the Wife has proposed that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_98\" id=\"Ftn_98_1\"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The joint UOB Bank Account ~ 465~6 be closed with monies divided 50-50 between the parties; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Each party to retain all assets in his/her own names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Given that the final ratio is 83.49% in favour of the Wife (which well exceeds the total value of assets in her name), I granted an order-in-terms of the Wife’s proposals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    In my brief grounds, I commended the Wife for demonstrating a spirit of give and take.

Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments. For instance, a party who earns no income but has substantial savings or had received substantial inheritance would well be able to afford to bear a higher burden of the maintenance obligation, if reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The court should also have regard to the assets received by parties after the division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    Having considered the financial capacity of the parties, I found it fair to apportion the maintenance equally between them.

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       A personal protection order (“PPO”), as its name suggests, operates to protect from family violence and not to punish for family violence. It is forward-looking: its focus is future family violence and not past family violence. Hence, the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”) allows a PPO to be made only where it is necessary to protect a victim from family violence going forward. That family violence has been committed or has been likely to be committed in the past is deplorable but will not justify a PPO where future family violence is unlikely. Even so, the law does not leave a victim of family violence without recourse: acts that constitute family violence may attract liability and be vindicated as civil or even criminal wrongs. Still, the fact that a victim has suffered family violence is not a license for the victim to retaliate with family violence of his or her own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Before me were cross-applications by spouses for PPOs. Chief among the allegations of the wife was that the husband had harassed her by taking photographs and/or videos of her in her undergarments (the “Images”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Chief among the allegations of the husband was that the wife had, after discovering the Images, harassed him by threatening to get him in trouble with the authorities unless he agreed to a divorce on her terms. The husband had subsequently moved out of the matrimonial home and had never returned. Yet, the wife continued to send extortionate communications to the husband, intending or knowing that they would cause him anguish. These continued communications made a PPO necessary for the protection of the husband from family violence, even as the dearth of physical interactions between them rendered unnecessary a PPO for the wife. Ultimately, each PPO application turns on its facts. Despite my sympathies for the wife, who had been anguished by the Images, I was constrained to dismiss her application and grant that of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The wife has filed an appeal against these decisions. I now provide my reasons for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The spouses married in October 2018 and had a child in March 2019. All three of them lived together in the matrimonial home. The spouses also worked together in a business that provided carpentry services. In that business, the wife handled sales and administration while the husband handled manufacturing and logistics.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the early hours of a morning towards the end of 2022, the husband found the wife in a carpark with another man.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He confronted the wife, who denied having an extramarital affair. The wife also told the husband that she no longer wished to share a bed with him. The wife then prevented the husband from sleeping in their bedroom in the matrimonial home. The husband moved to sleep in the living room of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 20 March 2023, after another disagreement between the spouses, the wife suspected that the husband had been telling others about her having an extramarital affair. She decided to check the messages on his mobile phone by logging onto a digital cloud storage system that was connected to his mobile phone (the “iCloud System”). Having assisted the husband to set up the iCloud System, she knew the password to it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Using that password, she accessed the iCloud System without the knowledge of the husband. There, the wife discovered the Images, which the husband had taken while she had been,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> or near,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> asleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The wife confronted the husband about the Images. The husband responded that he had been checking for signs of whether she had been intimate with other men. The wife disrobed and invited the husband to check her body for such signs. The husband declined to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The wife called the police, who arrested the husband and seized his mobile phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The husband did not return to the matrimonial home thereafter and has not returned to the matrimonial home since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Five days later, on 25 March 2023, the wife accessed the iCloud System again. There, she found indecent photographs of women whom she believed were clients of the carpentry business. She also found unclothed photographs of their child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On or around 1 April 2023, the wife told the husband that she wanted a divorce and invited him to agree to her proposals on the ancillary matters. The husband protested those proposals and said that he would not accept them. The wife replied: “I can afford to play. Can you afford to play?” and “You’re really in no position to negotiate with me. Think about it carefully.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 2 April 2023, the wife demanded that the husband attend at the office of her solicitors on the following day to sign the “divorce papers”. She added that she would “cancel the case” after he had done so, although she did not expressly clarify what she had meant by “case”. The husband replied that he “need[ed] to find someone to see first” and that her “terms of offer [were] ridiculous”. The wife responded: “If you don’t show up to sign tomorrow, I won’t leave any room for mercy for you or your family”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 3 April 2023, the husband did not attend at the office of the solicitors for the wife. The wife accessed a social media account of the husband and used it to send a text message to the sister of the husband: “Today, I had given one last chance, he did not come, your elder brother shall be prepared to go to jail”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 6 April 2023, the wife sent a letter to the husband on the letterhead of the carpentry business. In that letter, informed him that the business had terminated his employment thereto “with immediate effect”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     On 12 April 2023, the wife filed her application for PPOs for herself and the child against the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On 17 April 2023, the husband filed his application for a PPO for himself against the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Allegations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The cases of each spouse evolved over the course of the proceedings. Usually, the material facts on which an applicant premises an application for a PPO should be set out in the Complaint – the process by which a PPO application is originated. If material facts are omitted from the Complaint, a respondent may fairly contend that the applicant had chosen to forgo reliance on those facts (see <em>WNU v WNV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29868-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 18</a> at [5] and [9]), at least where the introduction of those facts at trial would take the other party by surprise (see <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [20]). Be that as it may, I found that each spouse had given the other ample notice of and opportunity to respond to all material facts raised by him or her, and that the case of each spouse that had emerged at trial did not surprise the other. I thus assessed their cases based on those that had emerged at trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The wife claimed that the husband had anguished her through continual harassment and had placed her in fear of hurt. She alleged that he had taken the Images without her consent. She added that he had raised his voice at her, “gaslight[ed]” her, and “badmouth[ed]” her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The wife claimed, on behalf of the child, that the husband had anguished the child through continual harassment, had placed the child in fear of hurt, and had caused hurt to the child. She alleged that he had photographed the child “naked and peeing”, hit the child, raised his voice at the child, and “constantly tell the child that mummy do not want daddy anymore, causing her to feel broken”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The husband claimed that the wife had anguished him through continual harassment, had caused hurt to him, and had placed him in fear of hurt. He alleged that she had sent him messages demanding that he agree to a divorce on her terms and promising him harm if he did not do so. He added that she had hit him on the head and the back as well as plucked his hair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Family violence and orders of protection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Two conditions must be proven on a balance of probabilities before a PPO may be granted. First, “family violence” must have been committed or must have been likely to be committed on a family member. Second, the PPO must be necessary for the protection of that family member. These conditions are set out in s 65(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The term, “family violence”, is expressly defined in the s 64 of the Charter, which reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Interpretation of this Part</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>64</b>.    In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires — …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<em>UNQ</em>”), Debbie Ong Siew Ling J (as she then was) expounded upon these statutory definitions (at [26]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Based on the statutory definition, family violence may be found in a variety of circumstances. Physically abusing a family member will constitute family violence under limb (b) of the definition where hurt (defined in s 64 of the Charter as bodily pain, disease or infirmity) was caused by an act that was known or ought to have been known would result in hurt. Acts that fall short of physical hurt but are committed to place a family member in fear of hurt, or where the respondent attempts to place the family member in fear of hurt, may also constitute family violence under limb (a) if such acts are committed wilfully or knowingly. Similarly, causing continual harassment to a family member may amount to family violence under limb (d). <em>The requisite intention or knowledge in limb (d) is quite specific – it is causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The primary allegation of each spouse was that he or she had been harassed by the other spouse. That said, the term, “harassment”, is not defined in the Charter. Even so, guidance as to its definition may be had from the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “POHA”), which sets out several types of wrongdoings that constitute “harassment”. As observed at the Second Reading of the Protection from Harassment Bill, the essence of “harassment” is “anti-social” or otherwise hostile and disruptive behaviour, whether committed in the physical world or the digital world. I excerpt the speech of the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, in introducing the Protection from Harassment Bill (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (13 March 2014) vol 91).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, the Bill makes clear that harassment and related anti-social behaviour are offences, whether committed in the physical world or online; and that must be so. It must be the consequence of the conduct, not where and how that conduct was carried out, that is important. Clauses 3 to 6 are medium-neutral. They extend to words, behaviour or communication used or made by &quot;any means&quot;, which will, obviously, include electronic means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… illustrations have been introduced in clauses 3 and 4. These illustrations reiterate and signal that the Bill will cover a wide range of anti-social behaviour, such as cyberbullying, bullying of children and sexual harassment. … Women who are sexually harassed at the workplace or outside will have a clear remedy. The difference from existing legislation under the MOA is that, now, it will be quite clear that online sexual harassment is also criminal conduct. Illustrations in the Bill give an idea of some of the types of behaviour which are covered. The illustrations are not intended to limit the situations which may amount to an offence under the Bill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the Bill introduces a new offence which is not found in the current legislation and, that is, unlawful stalking. Stalking can be highly disruptive to the lives of many people, often in devastating ways. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Four broad types of anti-social behaviour are fleshed out in the POHA: (a) intentionally causing harassment, alarm, or distress; (b) threatening, abusive, or insulting communications and behaviour; (c) causing fear, provocation, or facilitation of violence; and (d) unlawful stalking (see ss 3–7 of the POHA). Further, “sexual harassment”, wherever committed, falls squarely within the anti-social behaviours proscribed by the POHA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     With these observations in mind, I examined the applications for PPOs for the wife, the child, and the husband. Of these, the application for a PPO for the wife was the most hotly contested. I began with it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Protection of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Two broad allegations of family violence on the wife were levelled against the husband. First, that he had taken the Images without her consent. Second, that he had threatened and/or abused her orally. According to the wife, these incidents involved continual harassment that caused anguish to her and/or placed her in fear of hurt within s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The husband admitted to taking the Images without the consent of the wife but denied the other allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He claimed that the wife had applied for a PPO “to annoy [him] and to pressure [him] into signing divorce papers on terms that are only favourable to her.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It is undisputed that the husband had taken the Images, which showed the wife in her undergarments. It is also clear that she had not consented to his doing so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Further, she had been anguished when she learnt of the Images. Immediately after discovering them, she confronted the husband. She also complained to her brother and filed a police report about them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Acts that cause distress will fall within s 64 of the Charter if they constituted “continual harassment” and had been committed with the intention to cause or the knowledge that they would likely cause anguish (<em>UNQ</em> at [26]). Further, as the Family Division of the High Court observed in <em>UNQ</em> at [26], such intention or knowledge may be inferred “based on the state of the parties’ relationship at the time, or evidence of the communications between the parties at the relevant period”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the taking of the Images, without the consent of the wife, could constitute “harassment” within s 64 of the Charter insofar as it was, as turned out to be the case, perceived by the wife. The Images were indecent. By any measure, the taking of indecent images of another person, without the consent of that other person, was “sexual harassment”, as contemplated by the Legislature (see [21]–[22] above). It was anti-social and disruptive behaviour that, when perceived by that other person, would likely anguish him or her. It could also be insulting behaviour that caused harassment, alarm, or distress (see s 4 of the POHA). It could even constitute criminal offences. Although the wife had not seen the husband taking the Images, that did not make those acts of the husband any less anti-social or disruptive as to constitute “harassment” for limb (d) to the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter. Whether the husband had at in performing those acts intended or known that the acts would cause the wife anguish may be relevant to his mental state for that statutory provision but does not derogate from the harassing nature of his acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Moreover, the husband had taken the Images on multiple occasions. The harassment was, in the words of the District Court in <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [33] “sufficiently repetitive” as to constitute “continual harassment” within s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Even so, the causing of “continual harassment” to a family member would have been family violence only if it had been performed <em>with intent to cause or knowledge that it would likely cause anguish to that family member</em> (see limb (d) to the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter). Whether such intention or knowledge existed was to be inferred from all of the circumstances of the case (see <em>UNQ</em> at [26]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Here, the husband had taken the Images without the knowledge of the wife. Although he had stored the Images on his mobile phone and in the iCloud System, he had never intended or known that she would learn of the Images. He had protected his mobile phone with a password and had declined to unlock it when she had, for reasons unrelated to the Images, demanded that he do so. Even if he had sought her assistance to set up the iCloud System that was linked to his mobile phone, any belief that she would access the iCloud System on her own was unlikely to have operated on his mind. Indeed, the wife confirmed that she had never accessed the iCloud System<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> until he had accused her of having an extramarital affair and had done so on 20 March 2023 purely for reasons unrelated to the Images. The evidence thus did not prove that the husband had possessed the necessary intention or knowledge that his taking and storing of the Images would cause anguish to the wife for the purpose of limb (d) to the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Nevertheless, s 65(1) of the Charter provides that acts short of actual family violence may justify a protection order if they suggest that family violence is “likely to be committed”. It would be “untenable, both as a matter of logic or principle, for the court to only issue protection orders only when actual family violence has been committed.” This “ensures the utility of protection orders as a tool to anticipate a problem before it reaches an irreversible state” (<em>UTH v UTI (on behalf of child)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22888-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 27</a> at [29]­).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Here, the Images comprised multiple photographs and/or videos of the wife in her undergarments and had been taken on multiple occasions. The husband had a startling dearth of insight into the wrongfulness of his taking of them. As he testified in cross-examination, “I did not know that as husband and wife, this could not be done.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Hence, even if this dearth of insight left his acts short of actual family violence, it made likely, absent a material change of circumstances, that the indecent acts of the wife would continue. Hence, even if actual family violence was not made out, there could have been a likelihood of family violence in the form of continual harassment by way of indecent photography and videography that caused the wife anguish within s 65(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     For completeness, I considered the allegations that the husband had threatened the wife and abused her orally: that he had raised his voice at her, “gaslight[ed]” her, and “badmouth[ed]” her. The only evidence on these allegations were the bare assertions of the wife and the bare denials of the husband. No objective evidence was offered in corroboration of these allegations. These allegations were thus rejected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Even if the taking of the Images by the husband, coupled with his dearth of insight into the wrongfulness of his doing so, disclosed a likelihood of family violence on the wife, a PPO would be justified only if it was “necessary for the protection of” the wife from future family violence. This requirement for necessity is statutorily prescribed in s 65(1) of the Charter and “serves as a safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the court in family matters” (<em>UNQ</em> at [38] citing <em>UHA v UHB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [72]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To that end, there had been a material change of circumstances since the wife discovered the Images that rendered improbable similar family violence: the near-complete cessation of physical interactions between the wife and the husband. Since that discovery, the husband had moved out of the matrimonial home, had never returned thereafter, and had never expressed any intention to return. In the six months that had passed since that day, the wife had no unsolicited interactions, physical or digital, with the husband. She had met him physically only once, purely at her invitation and for the primary purpose of serving the documents for her applications for PPOs on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Almost immediately after servicing those documents, she went on her way.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> She had communicated with him primarily through text messages, and he had been cordial in his messages to her. And he had maintained this cordiality even in the face of the threats made by her. In these circumstances, it was difficult to identify any opportunity for or risk of similar family violence by the husband on the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Nevertheless, the wife could theoretically have been anguished not only by the taking of the Images but also by the continued storage and possession of them by the husband. However, this was unlikely. The mobile phone on which the Images had been stored had been seized by the police and was no longer in the possession of the husband. The iCloud System had never been and was unlikely to be accessed by the husband. There was also no evidence or even a suggestion that the husband had ever disseminated or would disseminate the Images, even as the wife alleged that the friends of the husband had shared indecent content amongst themselves. In any event, it was not the case of the wife that she had been anguished by the storage or possession or dissemination of the Images by the husband (as distinct from his taking of the Images).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As the Family Court reiterated in <em>UMI v UMK and UMJ and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [51], “a protection order is not intended to be punitive in nature”. That it was wrong for the husband to have taken the Images was not, without more, justification for the grant of a PPO. Only if a PPO was necessary to protect the wife from future family violence could it be granted (see <em>WLP v WLQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29626-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 10</a> at [15]–[16]). And the minimal future physical interactions between the wife and the husband had put paid to that risk. There was thus no justification for a PPO in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The wife claimed further that she feared for her safety because the husband had taken indecent photographs of not only her but also other women. But it was not evident, on the evidence before me, that the husband had in fact done so. Those women were non-parties to and did not give evidence in these proceedings. Nor were these proceedings, which concerned PPOs under the Charter, the appropriate forum to examine allegations about acts in respect of non-parties, especially non-parties who were not “family members” within the Charter. I thus placed little weight on this allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Protection of child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The wife claimed that the husband had caused hurt to the child and/or placed the child in fear of hurt in three broad ways: photographing the child while the child had been unclothed, “hit[ting] my little girl when he gets frustrated” and “tell[ing] the child that mummy do not want daddy anymore, causing her to feel broken”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> She added that a PPO was necessary to “protect [her] daughter as well from [the husband’s] pervasive [<em>sic</em>] actions”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The husband admitted to photographing the child in the bathroom but maintained that he had done so purely innocently and to commemorate a playful moment with the child. He also admitted to hitting the child but explained that he had done so purely to discipline her and never out of frustration.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I also wish to state that I have never hit [the child] out of frustration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If [the child] misbehaves, I will explain to her why she needs to be punished and give her a light pat on the buttocks as part of disciplining her. On the other hand, [the wife] loses her temper easily and hits [the child] if she gets frustrated at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Although the causing of physical hurt to a family member was quintessential “family violence”, s 64 of the Charter provides an exception for force “lawfully used … by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age”. This exception has its roots in the common law, which has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline to correct misbehaviour by a child. This exception is preserved today as a “thick grey line” that accommodates different parenting approaches affected by culture, personality, or personal experience. Parenting behaviour that falls within this “grey” area “may not be the best parenting practices but neither does such behaviour necessarily justify state intervention”. Beyond these limits, the behaviour even if consistent with variations in culture, personality, or personal experience would be abuse or ill-treatment and attract state intervention (see Debbie Ong Siew Ling, “The Quest for Optimal State Intervention in Parenting Children: Navigating within the Thick Grey Line” (2011) SJLS 61 at 80).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Still, any lawful correction of a child “must be to teach discipline with a measure of good sense and must always be exercised for the benefit of the child”. If the correction had been prompted by a desire to impose power over the child rather than for the benefit of the child, the exception would not hold, and the conduct would be family violence. The correction must also have been performed in a “responsible and loving” manner and have not descended into abuse that caused “unnecessary pain and suffering”. It must further have been “delivered in a judicious and responsible manner for the child’s benefit” (<em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> (“<em>VYB</em>”) at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I found that the physical punishment administered by the husband on the child constituted lawful correction of the child. The husband testified that he had hit the child only to discipline her when she had misbehaved, and only after explaining to the child about how she had erred. This testimony was not challenged by the wife, who agreed that the husband had hit the child only when the child had been “naughty”. Nor did the wife dispute the evidence of the husband that he had never hit the child out of frustration. On a balance of probabilities, the correction had not been excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I also found that family violence was not established in the allegations that the husband had told the child about the matrimonial problems between him and the wife and had photographed the child in the bathroom. Beyond the bare assertions of the wife, there was little evidence that the husband had told the child about the matrimonial problems between him and the wife. And even if the husband had done so, it was unclear that he did so intending to cause or knowing that it would likely cause anguish to the child. Similarly, the photographs of the child depict a playful scene with the child smiling in the direction of the camera while in the bathroom. This was not inconsistent with the explanation of the husband that he had taken the photographs simply to commemorate a light-hearted moment in the life of the child. It was thus probable that the husband had taken these photographs innocuously. In these circumstances, there had been no family violence or likelihood of family violence by the husband on the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Given these findings, a PPO for the child was not justified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Protection of husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The husband alleged that the wife had hit him, pulled his hair, and harassed him by threatening to get him in trouble with the authorities unless he agreed to a divorce on her terms. The wife denied the allegations of physical violence but admitted to sending him text messages demanding a divorce. Still, she maintained that she had demanded a divorce simply to protect the child from the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I begin with the allegations of physical violence. The evidence on these allegations comprised bare assertions by the husband and bare denials by the wife. I did not think that these allegations had been proven on a balance of probabilities and rejected them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I move to the allegation of harassment. This allegation was not stated by the husband in his Complaint. But the allegation was set out by the husband in detail in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief and addressed by the wife repeatedly in her evidence and in her closing submissions. There had thus been, for the wife, ample notice of and opportunities to address this allegation, which opportunities she had availed of extensively. I thus allowed the husband to maintain the allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The documentary evidence showed that the wife had sent multiple text messages to the husband after he had left the matrimonial home on 20 March 2023. These text messages followed her discovery of the Images and the photographs of persons whom she believed to be other women on the iCloud System, and her filing of police reports about the Images and those photographs. In those text messages, the wife badgered the husband to agree to a divorce on her terms. When the husband expressed reluctance about doing so, the wife informed him that “I can afford to play”, that “You’re really in no position to negotiate with me”, and that “You will be even more dead if you drag this out”. The wife also implied that she would stop the criminal proceedings against the husband were he to agree to her demands in respect of their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     This exchange of text messages began on or around 1 April 2023 with the wife demanding that the husband attend at the office of her solicitors on 3 April 2023 to sign the “divorce papers”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.44%\"><col width=\"79.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">Wife</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">I want a divorce</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">Husband</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">I know you want a divorce</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">Wife</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">By then don’t beg me</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">…</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">Even if you beg me for help, I may not be able to help you</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"QuoteList-Table-1\">Think carefully.

Moreover, these text messages were hostile if not threatening; they promised detriment by way of criminal sanctions unless the husband agreed to those terms. Indeed, these text messages were designed to cause anguish – it was precisely this anguish that would procure the agreement of the husband to those terms. The threats contained in these messages, particularly the one that the husband “shall be prepared to go to jail”, went well beyond any reasonable threat to exercise legal rights. In sending these text messages, which were extortionate, the wife perpetrated continual harassment with the intention to cause or the knowledge that it would likely cause anguish to the husband. This was family violence within limb (d) to the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The parties were undergoing divorce proceedings and remained in communication with each other. The wife had limited insight into the harassment and anguish that her text messages had caused. Even as recently as in her closing submissions in these proceedings that she had made on 18 October 2023, she justified her extortionate behaviour and offered no appreciation of its adverse effects.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Even if the wife had been anguished by the Images, her extortionate behaviour went well beyond any reasonable expression of that anguish. It persisted weeks after her discovery of the Images. It was also methodical and opportunistic: drawing up a list of demands in respect of a divorce then waving the spectre of imprisonment, shortly after the husband had been arrested, to procure his agreement to those demands. Given the likely continued communication between the parties in respect of their divorce, and even if if there had remained little room for physical interactions between them, a PPO was necessary for the protection of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I thus granted the application of the husband and declined to grant the applications of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The husband sought costs of $4,000, inclusive of disbursements, for these applications. These applications precipitated proceedings that spanned five mentions and two half-day hearings. The husband had succeeded fully in all the applications, and the sum that he sought was eminently reasonable. I fixed the costs of the proceedings accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Ultimately, a PPO is designed to protect a victim from family violence and not to avenge wrongs that he or she may have suffered. My declining to grant the PPO sought by the wife does not derogate from my sympathies for her. Nor does it exonerate the husband, whose taking and storage of the Images without the consent of the wife was egregious. To that end, I was given to understand that the husband was under investigation for possible criminal offences in respect of at least some of the photographs on the iCloud System. Even so, the wrongs of the husband did not give the wife a licence to extort and anguish the husband.

Ed.) (“WC”) for the maintenance of a child, the facts, and the parties themselves are not. The Complainant and the Respondent are not married and thus their child, [C] (“Child”), was born out of wedlock in March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The birth of a child is typically an event marked by joyous celebrations but, in this case, the birth of [C] was an occasion marked by feelings best described as tense (at least on the part of the Respondent and his family).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties themselves are young and both were not even at the age of majority when the Child was born. They are both adults now. The Respondent is currently serving his National Service (“NS”) and has less than a year more before he completes NS.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       When the Child was born, there was much confusion and suspicion; possibly because of the circumstances under which the parties had met, and how the Child came to be conceived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is not disputed substantively that the Respondent and the Complainant met when the former was doing <em>ad hoc</em> delivery rider work after he had completed his Polytechnic studies, before entering NS.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       According to the Respondent, he met the Complainant in May 2022. There must have been some degree of mutual attraction because by 31 May 2022, they were “sexually intimate”. Their amorous relationship continued for a few months, until July 2022 when the Complainant told the Respondent that she was pregnant with his child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Then came much confusion and uncertainty – as is not uncommon for young expectant parents to be in, certainly for the Respondent since this is his first child. The Complainant has a 3-year-old son from a previous romantic relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Respondent’s worries and confusion must have been quite significant, and to some extent, it appears that he is still somewhat puzzled by this turn of events. In his affidavit filed in these proceedings, he refers to the birth control measures he had taken during the fleeting period of the parties’ intimate relationship. This then led to rather unfortunate allegations raised about the Child’s paternity after the Child’s birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     But the Child’s parentage is now water under the bridge because the Respondent agreed to undergo a paternity test on his own volition. Both parties exhibited the paternity test results in their affidavits. The test report states that the likelihood of the Respondent being the Child’s father is 99.998%.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Put simply, the Respondent is the Child’s biological father and it is apparent that the protective / birth control measures did not work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I set out some detail about the parties’ relationship and the Child’s paternity to give context to the present case, and to make sense of some of the arguments which the parties – particularly the Respondent – had raised in the course of the hearing, of which I now turn to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Is there an obligation to maintain?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Respondent’s first argument was that he should not be made liable to pay any maintenance at all. Although this issue was not vigorously pursued during trial, it nonetheless remains part of the Respondent’s case in his counsel written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As mentioned above, the Respondent himself – having believed that he was safe through the use of contraception – never thought of having a child. This argument was buttressed by the Respondent’s narration (in his affidavit) of the discussions and interactions between the parties leading up to the delivery of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Much ink was also spilled talking about the parties’ private discussions on whether to keep the Child, the ensuing fallout between the 2 young would-be parents, as well as the communications between their respective families (after having discovered the Child’s existence).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The focus on these matters was rather unfortunate, as they operated as an unnecessary distraction to the key question, <em>viz.</em> is there a liability to maintain the Child since it is now clear that Mr [B] is the Child’s father?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To answer this question, one needs to first consider the statutory source of this obligation in s 68, WC which reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Duty of parents to maintain children</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">68.     <em><u>Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides</u></em>, it shall be the <u>duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody</u> or the custody of any other person, <u>and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate</u>, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The preamble to the provision is clear – it is the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, except where there is an agreement or order of court which says otherwise. This same provision was referred to in the Respondent’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     There is obviously no order of court governing the parties’ parental responsibility and so the only other exception is where there is an “<em>agreement</em>” between the parties. In the Respondent’s written submissions, attempts were made to refer to an alleged agreement wherein parties had agreed that if the Complainant wanted to keep the child, she would take “responsibility” for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Yet, when one looks at the Respondent’s affidavit and evidence adduced at trial, and despite the effort by counsel to suggest the existence of some sort of initial understanding for the Complainant to not go through with the pregnancy, the fact remains that there was no written or oral agreement where both parents had agreed that the Respondent need not maintain the Child at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s own affidavit evidence describes how by 17 July 2022 (about 1 week after first being informed by the Complainant about her pregnancy), the Complainant had informed the Respondent that she intends to keep the Child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Since then, the relationship between the parties took a down-turn, and they disagreed on whether to keep the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Respondent also pointed to a conversation on 20 July 2022 (a few days later) regarding the financial support for the Child, and that explained that “[The Complainant] <em>became hostile and told me that she would take me to court after the birth of the child</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     This puts it beyond peradventure that there was, in fact, <em>no agreement</em> between the parents that the Respondent need not maintain the Child; there was a disagreement and the Complainant wanted the Respondent to provide financial support. The Respondent not wanting the Complainant to have the Child is different from an agreement that if the Complainant did conceive the Child, that he need not maintain the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Since there was neither agreement nor a court order, s 68 imposes the obligation on the Respondent to maintain the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I had gone through the above analysis to demonstrate that even if I take the most generous reading of the statutory provisions (as cited by the Respondent in his counsel’s written submissions), the evidence does not point to any basis in fact or law for the Respondent to argue that he is under no responsibility to maintain the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     There was, strictly speaking, no need for the Court to have gone through the above review of the evidence because the case-law on this matter is clear in that parents simply <em>cannot</em> contract out the obligation to maintain their children by agreement. This was made clear in by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> (at [44]) where the CA held as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">44    The second principle is that the courts will not allow a parent to abdicate his/her responsibility of parent support. For that reason, we were careful to state that a marital agreement may be relevant to the question of the <em>quantum </em>of support, but not its <em>existence</em>. <b>Even though s 68 of the Charter begins with the phrase “[e]xcept where an agreement… otherwise provides”, a parent cannot contract out of the obligation to provide for his/her child</b>. As pointed out in Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law </em>(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“<em>Elements of Family Law</em>”) at p 409, this proviso must be read in conjunction with s 73 of the Charter, which empowers the courts to vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child if it is satisfied “that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Put another way, even if there was an express agreement for the Respondent not to maintain the Child, the Court may vary this agreement because the law does not usually allow one parent to abdicate his/her responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The discussion above was, in part, meant to address the Respondent’s lament that he took reasonable steps to prevent a pregnancy. That is simply not a legal basis to avoid having to maintain one’s biological child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In a way, the present case shares some similarities to the High Court case of <em>TBC v TBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17718-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 59</a>. In that case, the respondent father (who was married with children) had sought to argue that he was not liable to maintain his illegitimate child born out of a sexual affair with the complainant mother. The father had proclaimed that he had “<em>never wanted this child and didn’t even plan for this</em>” and that he had “<em>not recognised</em> [the] <em>child as</em> [his] son”. He too did not initially admit his paternity of the child until a DNA test confirmed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Despite the respondent-father’s attempts to resist liability, the High Court found that s 68, WC did impose the obligation on him, and Kan J upheld the lower court’s decision which found the father liable to maintain his illegitimate child. In the present case, the Respondent cited only the lower court’s decision in his counsel’s written submissions but the High Court’s remarks and observations in the same case were also relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the clear language of s 68, WC and the weight of the case-law on this issue, I therefore cannot accept the Respondent’s argument that he should not be made to maintain the Child. He is the Child’s father, and he is obliged to provide financial support for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance: Lump sum or Periodic?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As I have found that the Respondent needs to pay maintenance, the next question is to determine how much maintenance should be ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On this matter, the Respondent had another string to his bow – his counsel submitted that if I were to find the Respondent liable, the Respondent asks that he be allowed to pay $25,000, in a single lump-sum, as maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The effect of such an order would mean that once this amount is paid, the Respondent would no longer need to pay any more maintenance for the Child in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I start by noting that the Respondent’s arguments on this point are somewhat contradictory – on the one hand, the Respondent says that he is currently serving NS earning about $800 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In his affidavit, he explained that after deduction of his personal expenses, he is left with only $40.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He also stated in his affidavit that his parents (i.e. the Child’s grandparents) should not “<em>and will not</em>” be responsible for the Child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     That is a rather harsh position for grandparents to take regarding their grandchild (if it was true), but that is ultimately irrelevant. The Court’s focus remains on the <em>Respondent’s</em> obligations as a parent, and <em>not the grandparents’</em> obligation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In any event, if the Respondent is indeed left only with $40 a month, how then would he be able to make payment of the $25,000 he had suggested? I can only infer that he is (or will be) receiving help from somewhere or someone else, perhaps his family (i.e. the same family who he says will not help him).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Be that as it may, I do not find it reasonable to order a lump-sum maintenance at the present stage. Such an order would be entirely speculative given that the Child is not even 1 year old as at the time of this hearing. To fix a sum of $25,000 now would be presumptuous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Previous decisions of the High Court and the Family Court (for eg. <em>UTL v UTM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23130-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 10</a> at [109]; <em>UGM v UGN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20956-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 123</a> at [53]; <em>WNA v WNB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29850-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 14</a> at [96]) have explained that lump-sum maintenance is usually not awarded for young children save for exceptional circumstances as the Child’s needs and expenses would change with time, and it is usually difficult to predict at the time of hearing what their future expenses would be.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In many of these cases, the court was also concerned that ordering a large lump-sum maintenance may cripple the paying parent. Here, the situation is on the other end of the spectrum – ordering a lump sum amount of $25,000 when the Child is only several months old would have an <em>under</em>-inclusive effect. $25,000 works out to about $100 per month for the next <em>20 years</em> until the Child reaches the age of majority. It is thus not in the Child’s welfare and interests for such an order to be made now.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I therefore find that it is both reasonable and in the Child’s welfare to make a periodic order of maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     How much would be a reasonable amount for the Respondent to pay? I agree that his current earning capacity and position in life are relevant factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I have considered the list of expenses he has provided in his affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and I find that some items are on the high side and/or can be considered luxuries or voluntarily incurred expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Respondent listed monthly expense items such as a motorcycle loan (of approximately $230), petrol (of approximately $80), motorcycle maintenance and insurance savings (of approximately $150). Given that he is currently in NS, I do not see a need for him to incur motorcycle expenses. In any case, I find the petrol and maintenance costs to be rather high when according to the Respondent, he is a full-time NS man (“NSF”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I see no basis for him to insist on the use of a motor vehicle. He has certainly not shown any evidence that the Singapore Armed Forces or the Ministry of Defence <em>mandates</em> that an NSF (undertaking the Respondent’s vocation) must own a motorcycle as a mode of conveyance to his army camp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     That is not to say he cannot have such expenses, only that the Court must consider this category of expense against the needs of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Respondent has also included a provision of $50 as “allowance” for his parents. Yet, from his own evidence, his parents are working and can support themselves. As I had noted earlier, it is likely that his parents may even be providing financial assistance to the Respondent to help fund any lump-sum maintenance which might be ordered. Again, there is nothing wrong with filial piety, but it must be balanced against the Respondent’s <em>legal</em> obligation to maintain his Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Although I find that the Respondent is not completely without means, the Complainant’s list of expenses and her claim for the Child’s maintenance is also on the high side. She says that her personal expenses amount to $1,287 and that the Child’s expenses amount to $704.85.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These expenses include a <em>monthly sum</em> of $200 for clothing expenses, and another $50 for weekend expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Given the Child’s age, his needs and the Complainant’s own limited income, I do not find these expenses to be reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     That said, I do agree with the Complainant that the Respondent’s estimate of the Child’s reasonable (given during the course of cross-examination) was unhelpful. His suggested amount of $325.60 per month was on the low side. That does not come as a surprise given that the Respondent’s testimony revealed that he was not familiar with what is needed to maintain a young child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Ultimately, the fact remains that the Respondent is serving his NS, and his salary is limited – requiring him to support the Child at the original claim of $950 per month sought by the Complainant (which is more than his total salary) is neither realistic nor fair. The lower amount of $450 (proposed by the Complainant during the trial) is also high, given that it accounts for 60% of the Respondent’s current income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The High Court has recently decided that in matters of maintenance – especially children’s maintenance – the court will consider an appropriate “budget” to be allocated each month for various categories of expense: <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [10]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While I have explained why the Respondent, as the Child’s father, is required to contribute to the Child’s maintenance, the Child’s is also the Complainant’s son. I also take into account the fact that the Child is incurring expenses solely determined by the Complainant (without the Respondent’s input being sought), and she should therefore moderate her expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my view, an estimate of the Child’s reasonable expenses each month (based on the Complainant’s claimed categories of expenses) would be in the sum of approximately $400. Each parent should bear 50% of this amount.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col

month</u> as maintenance for the Child. By way of context, the Complainant is herself receiving $300 maintenance from the father of her first child (who is now approximately 4 years old).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Both parties are, of course, at liberty to apply to vary the maintenance ordered, in the future, if they are able to satisfy the applicable legal requirements justifying such a variation, including <em>inter alia</em> proof that there has been a material change of circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In conclusion, I note the unique context of the present case including the parties’ young age, the circumstances leading to the conception and subsequent birth of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     However, the law imposes an obligation on parents to maintain, and provide financial support to, their child. This is a facet of parental responsibility and one which is non-delegable. Whatever the history or context may be leading to the child’s arrival, it cannot be gainsaid that it was <em>not</em> the child’s choice to be born and having been born, the parents (who brought him into existence) must ensure that he or she is well taken care of and nurtured to adulthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In the present case, I hope that – in time – the Respondent would come to cherish the unique bond he has with his Child. His involvement in the Child’s life – both financially and, hopefully, non-financially – will go some ways to ensuring the Child’s success in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Accordingly, the Complainant’s application in MSS 1492/2023 is allowed.
