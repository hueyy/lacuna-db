The ancillary issues relating to custody, care and control, access of the children, division of matrimonial assets, wife maintenance and cost were adjourned to chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The ancillary matters proceeded for hearing on 7 January 2025 and my decision was delivered through Registrar’s Notice on 8 January 2025. The Wife has since appealed all of my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties are about 37 years of age and gainfully employed. The Wife was a senior Office Administrator and the Husband a freelance driver. At the time of the divorce, parties had been married for almost 9.5 years. There are 2 children born of their marriage, a son (turning 9 years in 2025) and a daughter (turning 7 years old in 2025). The Wife and children left the matrimonial home in March 2023. She applied for maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter and a by consent order for the Husband to pay $350 per month for each child’s maintenance was recorded without prejudice to her rights and claims for child maintenance in the divorce proceedings. There is also a Personal Protection Order against the Husband in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the hearing of the Ancillary Matters, I was informed by both counsel that parties are in agreement with the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Wife is not making a claim for her maintenance;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband shall pay the outstanding SP Services/utilities bills for the matrimonial flat incurred after March 2023; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Husband shall pay the outstanding Town Council Service and Conservancy charges for the matrimonial flat from March 2023 until the sale of the flat;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Husband shall pay 50% of the year end school books and uniform expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I accordingly ordered the above by consent as part of my eventual order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The issues before me for determination were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Care and control of the children and if shared care was not granted, access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Care and control and access </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife asked for care and control of the children to be granted to her and the Husband asked for shared care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife, in support of her claim, detailed her involvement in the care of the children since birth and in particular, how she became a homemaker for about 5 years before returning to employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband, in support of his case for shared care and control, points to the current arrangement since March 2023, wherein he has the children from Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm. He therefore submitted this should continue since it is workable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I do not find the current arrangements of timing that the Husband has with the children equates to a shared care and control order. It only provides for time the children spend with him. A shared care and control arrangement works in the interest of children if both parents are highly co-operative and willing to mutually discuss effective and reach agreements with regard to the daily activities of the children, e.g. which day the children go for what classes (without overly being calculative about how much care time that parent loses for example) so that the children’s daily life is seamless even when they switch homes. I do not believe the parties in this case have such a relationship. I find that the Wife has been the main caregiver of the children, therefore I grant her care and control in view of her involvement with the children since birth, their current young age and that they live primarily with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having granted care and control to the Wife, the issue of access to the Husband arises. The following access was agreed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Deepavali from 2pm to 8pm; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternate public holidays (except Deepavali) from 10am to 9pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As submitted by the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, he has had time with the children from Fridays 6pm to Sundays 6pm since March 2023. There were no allegations of violence from him towards the children. No issues have been raised by the Wife with regard to the time the children were with him since so he should have the same timing for access. He also sought half of the March, June, September and year end school holidays with liberty to travel and midweek dinner access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Although the Wife had raised issues with overnight access in her affidavits and concerns over the children’s safety in view of the Husband’s violent behaviour, there was no response from the Wife about the current arrangements described by the Husband that have been in place for more than 1.5 years. The Wife submitted that weekend time should be carved out for her as well and that March and September school holidays were a short one week so there was no need to grant half to the Husband. There was also a concern raised as to whether the Husband would exercise access faithfully in view of the uncertainty of the Husband’s hours of work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I accept that the Wife should also have some time on the weekends to spend with the children as she would have little opportunity to plan any leisure activities if she only has the weekdays when the children are in school and she is at work. I also accept that there is evidence to support her allegations of family violence by the Husband towards her but there is no evidence of any such behaviour towards the children. The fact that the Husband has been having overnight weekend access without incidents for more than 1.5 years also allay any concerns. As for his working hours, I accept the Husband’s submission that he can arrange for his work to be scheduled around access time given that it is flexible. There were no instances raised to show that he has not shown up for access. I am also wary of reducing access periods only on a speculative problem. Furthermore, plans can change even within an intact family. It is for parties to communicate and make alternative arrangements to deal with the change in plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Access time is to enable the children to continue to have a bond with a parent whom they do not live with primarily. I therefore granted half of the school holidays (including the March and September school holidays) and a midweek access bearing in mind the children’s routine given the following day would be a weekday. For completeness, even though the March and September school holidays are relatively shorter school holidays compared to the June and year-end school holidays, there is no reason not to give the Husband and children the opportunity for access. After all, public holidays (usually a brief one-day holiday) are also commonly shared between parents. I also allowed both parties the liberty to bring the children overseas during their time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made the following orders for access (including those by consent as set out in paragraph 11 above):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During school term,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Weekly from Friday 6pm to Saturday 8pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wednesdays from 5:40pm to 7:30pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Half of the March, June, September and year end school holidays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Either party is at liberty to take the children overseas during their time with the children upon at least 14 days advance notice to the other party with the travel itinerary and contact details.</p> <p

she sought the same to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. With regard to legal fees of parties, following <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25220-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 109</a>, they should not be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets but each party should settle their own legal costs from their respective share of the assets.

It was conceded the Husband provided the financial support for the family although the exact amount he provided was disputed. He claimed to have provided his entire salary which was between $2,000 to $7,000 previously. When the Wife started work, he stopped providing his entire salary but still provided $3,000 to $4,000. The Wife disputed the amounts he claimed to have provided but asserted that he gave her $2,000 monthly, which he at times took back from her when he ran out of money. There was no evidence to support either party’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Using a broad brush approach, I considered that generally the Wife was the main caregiver whilst the Husband was the breadwinner for about half their marriage. In addition, in the later half of the marriage, the Wife also contributed financially towards the family when she started work. I therefore attribute 60% of the indirect contributions to her and 40% to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Both parties applied equal weightage between direct and indirect contributions and the final share of the matrimonial assets would be 50.6% to the Wife and 49.4% to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Out of the pool of matrimonial assets, each party would retain their own assets. The Wife’s 50.6% of $519,720.26 amounts to $262,750.75. After deducting $34,569.41 which is already retained by her, she is entitled to $228,181.34 from the matrimonial flat. This amounts to 51% of the net value of the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I therefore ordered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The matrimonial assets shall be divided 50.6% to the Wife and 49.4% to the Husband. In this regard, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 6 months from the Final Judgment. The net sale proceeds (after repayment of the outstanding mortgage loan and cost and expenses of sale) shall be divided 51% to the Wife and 49% to the Husband. Each party to refund their CPF accounts for monies utilised in the acquisition of the matrimonial flat including accrued interest from their respective share of the net sale proceeds.

items 8, 9 and 10 of the expense list. For item 8, both children are Singapore citizens enrolled in a local primary school. The school fees is listed as $13 per child and there is no explanation or evidence to prove the Wife’s claim that their school fee is $32.50 per child. I determined the school fees as $13/child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>, it was held that</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case……It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drafting up what can be described as a “budget”, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For enrichment/tuition, the Wife claimed a monthly expense per child of $340. This accounted for a substantive 1/3 of her expense claim for the children but there was no evidence on this expenditure or what it entailed. Not every child requires enrichment/tuition. Different types of enrichment and/or tuition will affect the reasonable amount to be budgeted for a child. Without any evidence as to any enrichment/tuition that the children are enrolled in and their costs, I excluded this claim. With regard to hobbies/sports claim of $135 per child, similarly there was a lack of evidence on this expense. However, I accept that it is reasonable for all children to have some form of hobbies and sports. Without any other evidence to assist me in in determining the reasonable sum based on the hobby or sports the child engages in, I allocated $60 per child per month for this expense on a broad budgeting basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife’s take home income is $2,913 and submits the Husband should have a higher income than what is declared because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Previously in the marriage when they were together, his income was $7,000 and this is proven by his self-declaration of providing $3,000 to the Wife monthly previously; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He continues to be in the same field of work so his income should remain the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband disputes earning $7,000 or $5,000, a figure was used by the Wife’s Counsel to submit he should pay more maintenance. He declared he earned an average of about $3,600 from his jobs. He exhibited his Notice of Assessment which shows he earned $48,000 in one year, i.e. $4,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I had difficulty accepting the Wife’s argument regarding the Husband’s past income because it is based on the Husband’s assertion which she has expressly disputed. If she wants the Court to disbelieve that he didn’t provide as much financial support as he claimed for the purposes of dividing matrimonial assets, she cannot then flip her entire position to now claim it is true for the purposes of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband has provided supporting evidence of his current income and there is no evidence to find that he has a higher income currently. Nonetheless, the Husband offered to bear 64% of the children’s expenses, which I find is a fair proposal given that he earns about 58% of their combined income. I therefore ordered him to pay 64% of $1,306 which amounts to $835.84. I rounded this up to $840 in total (i.e. $420 per child).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In view of both parties’ practical and reasonable approaches during the hearing before me and also in view that neither party really succeeded fully on any particular point, I made no order as to cost.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 of Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement"],"date":"2025-01-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 1648 of 2024","title":"XHQ v XHR","citation":"[2025] SGFC 10","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32809-SSP.xml","counsel":["The complainant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-02-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHQ v XHR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHQ <em>v</em> XHR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32809-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 10</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 1648 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The complainant in person and unrepresented; The respondent in person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHQ — XHR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Enforcement</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were divorced in 2016. Pursuant to an order of court (“FC/ORC xx/2016”), the Father was ordered to pay $500 as monthly maintenance for the two children of the marriage. This sum was to be deposited into the Mother’s bank account on the last day of every month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 19 July 2024, the Mother applied for an enforcement of maintenance arrears <em>vide</em> MSS 1648/2024 (“MSS 1648”). The matter was fixed for hearing, and I heard the trial on 1 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Towards the end of the trial, it was discovered that the Father had been recording the proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> A check done by the court officer showed two audio recordings of the trial on his phone. By recording the proceedings, the Father was in contempt of court: s 5 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. The Father was given an opportunity to purge his contempt: <em>You Xin v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0017.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 17</a> at [54]. He did so by deleting those recordings and confirmed that he had not disseminated any recordings made. He also apologised for his conduct.

This, of course, assumes that the maintenance order should be enforced, and in that vein, it has been held that “the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is for a respondent to be given a chance to “show cause” (<em>ie</em>, provide reasons which are satisfactory to the Court) why an enforcement order should not be made against him or her”: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> (“<em>VUJ</em>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> at [20] citing <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a>; <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a> at [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As to when a respondent to an enforcement application has shown cause, that is an assessment which must, naturally, turn on the facts. At the end of the day, what is important to bear in mind is whether the making of an enforcement order would “lead to injustice and/or where it would be inequitable to do so given the circumstances and facts of a given case”: <em>VUJ</em> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To give a flavour of the sort of circumstances in which a respondent had been found by the Family Courts to have shown cause, I reproduce the succinct summary in <em>VUJ</em> at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg., <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg. <em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the trial, there was no dispute between the parties as to the arrears owed which came in at $3000 as of 1<sup>st</sup> November 2024. The real contention between the parties was whether the Father had given good reasons as to why these arrears should not be enforced against him, specifically, whether the Father’s medical condition was a good reason for his non-payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father gave evidence that he used to work as an IT engineer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> However, he had not been working this year owing to his medical condition. He testified that he had been admitted to hospital for treatment, and that he had a heart attack on 11 June 2024. Later, on 12 August 2024, he underwent cardiac surgery. The doctors had told him that a complete recovery would take approximately 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father also told me that he intended to look for work once he had fully recovered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In his estimation, he figured that he would be able to resume his obligation to pay child maintenance once he managed to find a job that was not too physically taxing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not doubt that the Father had a serious heart condition, or that he had had surgery. Signs that he had undergone surgery were plainly evident from the medical tubes protruding from beneath his shirt. In addition, the Father had also produced a bundle of medical certificates from the hospital which showed that he had been in and out of hospital since March 2024. There was also a letter from the doctor stating that the Father was receiving inpatient medical care, including cardiac surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father explained that notwithstanding his medical condition which had put him out of work since January 2024, he had tried his best to continue paying maintenance. He had drawn down on his savings to do so, and his current wife had also chipped in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He told me that his savings were down to $100, and that his current wife was shouldering the financial burden during this time. When quizzed about his current medical expenses, the Father said that he was paying roughly $200 each month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father, however, had not put any documents (<em>ie</em>, bank statements) in evidence to support his assertion that he was cash-strapped as a result of his medical condition and therefore could not afford the $500 monthly maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     That being said, I add that there are also two pieces of evidence which, to my mind, pointed to the <em>real</em> reason behind the Father’s failure to keep up with the maintenance payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The first was his response to the Mother’s question. She had asked why he could not simply have responded to her repeated text messages chasing him for payment to say that he could not pay.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s response was that the Mother was only concerned with getting the money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> When he was hospitalised, she did not enquire as to how he was doing, but rather, kept hounding him for the monthly payments. The Father went on to add that he was not spending time with the children despite having gone through supervised visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He told me that he wanted to spend time with the children, but the Mother did not allow that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second was a text message dated 12 June 2024. The Father’s current wife had texted the Mother, using his phone, to inform her that the Father was unwell and that the money would be transferred. The money owed, however, was never transferred and the Mother continued to hound the Father for payment. I would also note from the screenshots which the Father produced, that it is clear that the Mother did send rather nasty text messages to him in demanding for payment owed under the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It appears to me that the Father may well have ceased payment because of his frustration with the Mother’s attitude and her continued refusal to let him see the children. I would add that if it were indeed the case that the Father had intended to keep up with his maintenance obligations, but could not afford to do so, he could have sent the Mother a text, providing her with details about his health condition and asked for more time to make payment. Instead, there was radio silence. And while the Father chalks this up to his hospitalisation after surgery, he had more than 3 months to at least send a simple response to the Mother’s repeated text messages. He did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore did not find that the Father had shown cause as to why the arrears should not be enforced. Although the Father was still recovering from a heart operation, he had not managed to show that his medical condition put him in such dire financial straits such that he simply could not afford to pay the $500 monthly maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus allowed the Mother’s application in MSS 1648 to enforce the arrears of $3000 and made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father shall pay off these arrears in monthly instalments of $100, starting from April 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This sum of $100 shall be paid on the last day of every month; directly to the Mother’s stipulated bank account;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the avoidance of doubt, maintenance that is owed under the current order remains payable.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 31 – 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The appeal against the DJ’s decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 74/2021 was deemed withdrawn on 28 September 2021.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The appeal against the DJ’s decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 108/2023 was dismissed on 24 April 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 16, lns 5 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at p 16, lns 11 – 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, lns 1 – 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript at p 26, lns 1 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27 lns 16 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Transcript at p 28, lns 9 – 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Transcript at p 28, lns 14 – 15.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2025-01-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)","title":"XHA v XHB","citation":"[2025] SGFC 9","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32806-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Luke Anton Netto (Netto & Magin LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-06T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHA v XHB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHA <em>v</em> XHB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32806-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 9</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Both applications had been taken out by the Wife who sought orders in relation to discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ submissions in respect of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Netto, argued in written submissions, that it was the Wife who should be, pursuant to Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (the “FJR 2014”), liable for costs to the tune of $500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was because the Wife had failed to, prior to taking out SUMs 3376 and 3318, serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories on the Husband. This meant that the Husband had no opportunity to respond to the voluntary request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Mr Netto further pointed out that while the Wife was self-represented, the learned Assistant Registrar had, in a case conference on 14 November 2024, highlighted that an “application for discovery and/or interrogatories ought to be in relation to existing request(s) where one party did not receive a satisfactory response to”, and that there could be cost consequences if one were to proceed with their application without first taking out a voluntary request.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Finally, Mr Netto argued that the Wife should be ordered to pay costs to signal, to parties, the importance and necessity of complying with the rules of procedure which are meant to ensure “fairness and equity in the proceedings”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife, on the other hand, took the position that she was entitled to costs in respect of both SUMs 3376 and 3318. She gave the following reasons. First, that apart from incurring $221.80 in the filing of both summonses, she had also spent a great deal of time and effort in learning how to navigate the “complex legal processes without the benefit of formal legal training”. Second, the Wife highlighted the Husband’s conduct, namely, that he would alternate between verbal threats and passive indifference which “created unnecessary delays and heightened emotional distress”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s behaviour took a toll on her which necessitated sessions with a psychologist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event. The court, however, can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Netto relies on Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the FJR 2014 to argue that it is the Wife who should have to pay costs to the Husband, even though she had succeeded in both her applications. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Costs arising from misconduct or neglect</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">857.—(1)    Where it appears to the Court in any proceedings that anything has been done, or that any omission has been made, unreasonably or improperly by or on behalf of any party, the Court may order —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the costs of that party in respect of the act or omission, as the case may be, shall not be allowed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that any costs occasioned by that party to any other party shall be paid by him to that other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), the Court must for the purpose of that paragraph have regard to the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the omission to do anything the doing of which would have been calculated to save costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the doing of anything calculated to occasion, or in a manner or at a time calculated to occasion unnecessary costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    any unnecessary delay in the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The Court may, instead of giving an order under paragraph (1), direct the Registrar to inquire into the act or omission and, if it appears to the Registrar that such an order should have been given in relation to it, to act as if the appropriate order had been given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The Registrar shall, in relation to anything done or omission made in the Court of taxation and in relation to any failure to procure taxation, have the same power to disallow or to award costs as the Court has under paragraph (1) to order that costs shall be disallowed to or paid by any party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Where a party entitled to costs fails to procure or fails to proceed with taxation, the Registrar may, in order to prevent any other parties being prejudiced by that failure —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    allow the party so entitled a nominal or other sum for costs; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    certify the failure and the costs of the other parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 857 is derived from Order 59 Rule 7 of the Rules of Court 2014 and forms one of the “well-established exceptions to the general rule that costs follow the event”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [857.01]. For example, it is noted that in cases where a plaintiff has adopted an “entirely wrong procedure”, that plaintiff may have to pay his opponent’s costs even though he has prevailed: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</em> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“White Book”) at 59/7/7 citing <em>Re Nichols &amp; Von Joel’s Contract</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/49176-E-M.xml')\">[1910] 1 Ch. 43</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, the Wife did not first serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, prior to taking out both applications. As I had noted in my judgment, the Wife could not, despite being self-represented, be said to be wholly ignorant of the applicable procedural rules: <em>XHA v XHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a> at [7]. I also note that in the case conference on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2024, the learned Assistant Registrar told the Wife that costs may be ordered if she did not first take out a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories before putting in a formal application to court – the Wife was also told to seek legal advice on the implications of pursuing her applications if she was unsure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s course of action naturally meant that there was no voluntary request for the Husband to respond to. As Mr Netto points out, this means that the Husband did not have the opportunity to “negotiate on the time period and/or type of documents to be provided”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I add that although the Husband had resisted the Wife’s application in both SUMs 3376 and 3318, this does not necessarily mean that he would have responded in the same way to a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The point remains that because a voluntary request for the items sought in SUMs 3376 and 3318 was never made, the Husband never had an opportunity to consider and respond to those requests, or make proposals in respect of these requests for the Wife to consider.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I deem it fit to depart from the general rule that costs shall follow the event. I order that the Wife pay costs for both SUMs 3376 and 3318, which are fixed at $350 (all-in), to the Husband.

The Mother sought, from the Father, $400 per month as maintenance for their son. Both the Father and the Mother had been divorced in October 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 4 September 2024 and allowed the Mother’s application. I ordered that the Father pay monthly maintenance of $150 per month, at the end of every month, with effect from 1 June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       When it comes to such applications for maintenance, s 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 is the first port of call. In particular, s 69(2) provides that the court may, “on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child” (see also <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [8(a)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found that the Father had indeed neglected to provide maintenance for his son. During the trial, I heard evidence from the Mother that she was the one who had supported the child, even throughout their marriage. The Father’s own testimony corroborated the Mother’s account. He told me that he had only contributed some money when his son was born. However, as his son was growing up, he could not afford to support him. This was because he was homeless and sleeping in the streets. The Father explained that he worked odd-jobs as a mover on a part-time basis and only made $70 a day. At times, he was only able to find a 2-day job in a single week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In my judgment, the Father should therefore be ordered to pay maintenance for his son – the next issue I had to consider was the quantum of such maintenance the Father should be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In making such an order for child maintenance, s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 stipulates that the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including factors such as the financial needs of the child (s 69(4)(<em>a</em>)), the income and earning capacity (if any) of the child (s 69(4)(<em>b</em>)), and the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage (s 69(4)(<em>d</em>)) (see also <em>WIM v WIL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28998-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 80</a> at [4] – [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>). The court does not adopt a mathematical approach to calibrating the quantum of child maintenance. As was recently noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Applicable legal principles for quantifying maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9     <b>Maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case: see s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”).</b> The mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance. Instead, parties should show how their projected expenditure for the child’s expenses is reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the child’s standard of living and the parents’ financial means and resources. Further, the changed circumstances following the marital breakdown of the parents’ relationship are relevant as the breakdown of a household invariably has an impact on the family’s financial needs and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10     <b>It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure.</b> This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case. While receipts are useful as an indication of the child’s accustomed standard of living, they are not necessarily conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are. It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drawing up what can be described as a ‘budget’, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category (see, for example, the table set out below at [13]). It was observed in <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (at [13]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly, household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regular specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother explained that she had taken out her application in MSS 1060 as she was facing difficulty in supporting her son given the state of her health and her son’s growing expenses. She was unable to work as she was battling a host of medical conditions which included: a nerve issue which required surgery, as well as diabetes and cholesterol. In addition, the Mother also explained that she had been seeing a psychiatrist from the Institute for Mental Health for depression and anxiety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I also heard evidence that the son was working part time and was earning an hourly wage of $10. The Mother would give him some money amounting to $350 – $400 a month for school fees and food. I was also told, by the Mother, that the son, who is currently a student at the Institute of Technical Education, intends to further his education by enrolling in polytechnic. The Mother shared that the son would like to focus on his studies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Mother’s circumstances, it was clear to me that the Father must do his part to provide financially for the son. That is his responsibility as a parent. In that connection, the Father told me that in his estimation, he would be able to afford $100 a month in child maintenance, but only upon his release from prison in 2026. He had begun serving a two-year sentence earlier in March this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I thus ordered that the Father pay maintenance of $150 per month to his son starting from 1 June 2026, and that this sum be paid on the last day of every month. This means that the first payment will be made on the last day of June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In drawing up this order for maintenance, I placed weight on the Father’s financial circumstances and his capacity to make payment (see <em>VLO v VLP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26219-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 68</a> at [135]; <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [14] – [15]). I accepted that the Father currently had no means of paying monthly child maintenance given his testimony that he had no savings, and the fact that he was currently in jail. It was also likely, in my judgment, that the monthly sum of $400 which the Mother had sought, while a reasonable sum to ask for in respect of child maintenance, would be beyond the Father’s means. There was, in my judgment, little point in making an order that the Father had no means of being able to comply with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to what the Father could reasonably afford, I took into account his evidence that he had previously been able to find part-time work at a rate of $70 per day. Even accepting that the Father may not be able to find part-time work at the same daily rate for every day of the month, the monthly sum of $100 which the Husband thinks he can afford is, in my judgment, on the conservative side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This order gives the Father a little time to get back on his feet upon his release from prison sometime at the end of March 2026. The Father will have about 3 months to find a job and to get his finances in order so that he can begin to do his part to support his son. While he has not done so for the better part of his son’s life, it is not too late for him to start doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given that the Mother did not ask for costs of her application, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Pursuant to an Order of the Syariah Court.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The appeal filed against the decision of the District Judge was deemed withdrawn on 22 December 2022.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Interim maintenance – Child – Whether a husband can be required to pay, as child maintenance, his wife’s pregnancy-related medical expenses","Family Law – Interim maintenance – Wife – Whether a husband can be required to pay, as spousal maintenance, his wife’s pregnancy-related medical expenses","Evidence – Whether a wife is required to prove the paternity of her unborn child when seeking payments from her husband to cover her pregnancy-related medical expenses – Section 114(1) Evidence Act 1893"],"date":"2024-11-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS No. 1306 of 2024","title":"XFJ v XFK","citation":"[2024] SGFC 102","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32782-SSP.xml","counsel":["Wife and Husband in person."],"timestamp":"2025-01-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XFJ v XFK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XFJ <em>v</em> XFK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32782-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 102</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Is she obliged to prove the child’s paternity to succeed in her application? Can the wife compel the husband to “refund” the past payments that she had already made? These are some of the issues raised in MSS No. 1306 of 2024 (“<b>MSS 1306</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The applicant (“<b>Wife</b>”) and respondent (“<b>Husband</b>”) were married on 20 December 2021.

This is because she can use such funds for maintenance: <em>VRJ v VRK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25984-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 9</a> at [20] &amp; [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Two</em>, given that interim maintenance is intended to meet a wife’s immediate financial needs and <em>not to compensate</em> her for expenses that she had already paid, it must follow that in the absence of compelling reasons, it would be wrong in principle to order the husband to “refund” her such payments as interim maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, in deciding on the amount of interim maintenance to order, courts adopt a <em>broadbrush approach</em>. The interim maintenance ordered will typically be “<em>modest</em>” and be less than the maintenance that can be ordered at the ancillary stage of a divorce proceeding. This is because courts do not have the means to make a thorough investigation of the parties’ financial matters when hearing an interim maintenance application: <em>Lee Bee Kim Jennifer v Lim Yew

<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Having outlined by parties’ position, I will now deal with each of the items in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Food and groceries</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parties have taken conflicting positions on whether the Husband had paid for the daughter’s food and groceries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, the Husband had stopped paying for these items since 1 April 2024. As a result, she had to purchase the items herself. To support her claim, the Wife referred me to five transaction records of purchases which she had made in July 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband accepted that these records related to the purchase of food items. However, he submitted that the food items would have been consumed by persons residing in the matrimonial flat – and not just the daughter alone. In any event, the Husband insisted that he had also paid for the daughter’s food items from April to September 2024. He referred me to two transactions records in May 2024 to support his claim.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In my view, the reality is probably that while the Husband did pay for some of the daughter’s food items, such purchases would have been <em>rare</em>. My reasons for this view are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the daughter is cared for by the Wife’s mother at all material times. Not being the child’s caregiver, it is likely that the Husband would not have been fully aware of <em>what</em> to buy for the growing child and <em>when</em> to buy them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the mother is more likely to inform the Wife (than the Husband) when there is a need to replenish the daughter’s food items given that the parties are estranged. Furthermore, the Wife works at a supermarket, and it would be convenient for her to purchase the relevant items.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, given the acrimonious relationship between the parties, it is also not surprising that the Husband would not have voluntarily (i) asked the Wife whether he needed to replenish the daughter’s food items, or (ii) reimbursed her for the items that she had bought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given that the bulk of the daughter’s food items are purchased by the Wife, the next question is whether she needs the Husband’s help to pay for them. To answer this question, it is necessary to ascertain two things. <em>First</em>, what are the monthly costs of the daughter’s food items? <em>Second</em>, can the Wife afford to pay for these items herself?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Regarding the first issue, the Wife estimated that the costs would be about $150/month for the daughter’s food and $320/month for her groceries – i.e., a total of about $470/month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I am unable to accept this estimation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there appears to be an overlap between these expenses in the Wife’s computation. During examination-in-chief, she testified that “groceries” included (i) milk powder, (ii) dinner (and occasionally breakfast) for the child, (iii) medicine, (iv) clothing and shoes. Clearly, items (i) and (ii) would be considered “food”. When asked to explain the overlap, the Wife could not give a coherent answer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, I find the estimated expenses of $470/month for food items for a two-year-old child to be high. A significant component of these expenses is presumably the costs of milk powder. In this regard, I note that the daughter is at an age when she is likely to be transitioning to solid foods fully quite soon. This means that the cost of her food items is likely to reduce over time as milk powder for a toddler is more expensive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, a budget $200/month for the daughter’s food items is more reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     This brings me to the second issue – can the Wife afford this amount on her income? In my view, the answer is no: see [40] below. Accordingly, I order the Husband to pay <em>$200/month</em> for the daughter’s food items. In making this order, I note that the Husband is prepared to pay up to $400/month for the daughter’s maintenance if required by law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife has requested for the payment to take effect from April 2024 – i.e., when she began paying for the daughter’s food items. If this request is allowed, it will mean that the Husband has to “refund” $1,600 in total to the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I do not think that this is correct: see [5(b)] above. Accordingly, I order that the payment for the daughter’s food items is to <em>start from December 2024</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Diapers</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now come to the Wife’s claim that the Husband had failed to pay for the daughter’s diapers. She seeks a court order to compel the Husband to pay $80/month for this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I decline to this request. My reasons are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the evidence shows that the Husband did in fact pay for the daughter’s diapers in May<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and October 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> When confronted with this evidence, the Wife testified that it was “hard [for her] to prove” how much he had paid for the diapers monthly<em>.</em> The Wife’s evidence contradicts her case that the Husband had failed to pay for the diapers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the daughter is already two years old. She would probably not be requiring diapers soon. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to hardcode the payment of diapers into a court order. It is better to let the Husband to continue to buy the diapers based on the daughter’s needs, which will reduce with time. To be clear, this does not mean that the Husband can arbitrarily refuse to buy the diapers moving forward. I expect him to act reasonably and in accordance with his daughter’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Childcare fees</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now turn to the third component of the Wife’s application for child maintenance – $741.20/month for the daughter’s childcare fees. The Wife relied on the “statements of accounts” issued by the childcare centre in May and July 2024 to support her claim that she had been paying the fees and not the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I am unable to accept the Wife’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the July “statement of account” clearly stated that the “Payment Mode” for the fees is by “CDA GIRO”. The reference number for the payment is “XXXX80001”. The last five digits correspond to the last five digits of the <em>Husband’s</em> joint OCBC Child Development Account with the daughter (“<b>CDA</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In other words, the July payment was made by GIRO deduction from the Husband’s CDA account – and not by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife is concerned that if the fees (full amount) are deducted from the CDA every month, the account will be depleted by around <em>April/May 2025</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In other words, her application for interim maintenance is to address a financial need that <em>may potentially</em> occur about six months away. This is clearly beyond the scope of interim maintenance – which is to address an applicant’s <em>immediate</em> financial needs: see [4] above. Furthermore, while the Wife’s concern is understandable, it is not a given that the CDA will be depleted anytime soon. This is because the Government has been providing fee refunds and subsidies into the account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In other words, it is likely that the funds in the CDA will last longer than six months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband had assured during the hearing that he will pay for the daughter’s childcare fees if the CDA funds are depleted. The Wife had failed to provide me with any reason why I should disbelieve the Husband’s assurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Travel</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, the Wife wants the Husband to contribute $100/month as “travel” expenses. Her plan is to save up these contributions so that the daughter could go with her on overseas holidays once or twice a year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband objects to paying for this item. According to him, this is a luxury item and not a necessity. He would bring his daughter for overseas travel at his own expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I agree with the Husband and decline to order him to make the payment. The “travel” expenses claim clearly does not qualify as an immediate financial need that justifies an interim maintenance order. The more appropriate stage to consider such a claim is at the ancillary stage of a divorce proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Application for interim child maintenance – The unborn child </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I now come to the Wife’s application for interim child maintenance for the unborn child. The nature of her application and the Husband’s response to it are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"50.76%\"><col width=\"49.24%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s position</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s position</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$1,598/month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></b> To cover –</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Pregnancy-related expenses</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(pre-natal checkups and delivery)</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) Costs of hiring a helper after the unborn child is delivered</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) The Husband is unclear whether he is the father of the unborn child.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) The Husband wants an abortion for the following reasons:</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">- The parties have a failed marriage filled with acrimony.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">There is no need to bring another child into this world to suffer.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">- Having another child will also allow the Wife to demand more money from him. He has suffered enough already.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) The Wife had agreed to abort the unborn child, but changed her mind later.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(d) Since it is Wife’s decision to keep the unborn child, she should not look to him to maintain it.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Pregnancy-related medical expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I reject the Wife’s application for the Husband to pay – as <em>child</em> maintenance – the Wife’s pregnancy-related medical expenses. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, whenever the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) refers to the right to child maintenance, this is in the context of a parent providing for a child’s <em>material needs</em> such as “accommodation, clothing, food and education”: see, e.g., s 68 of the Charter. See also s 69(4)(f) which requires a court to consider, among others, the “<em>standard of living enjoyed</em> ... by the child” when assessing the amount of maintenance to order. Such considerations logically cannot be applied to an unborn child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is <em>conceptually</em> unclear how the pregnancy-related medical expenses fit within the concept of child maintenance under the Charter. The Wife’s application assumes that the pre-natal checkups and the delivery are for the purpose of “maintaining” the unborn child. In my view, such an assumption is controversial. For instance, one can reasonably argue that such actions are taken to ensure the <em>safety and health</em> of the Wife and the unborn child – instead of “maintaining” the child. Furthermore, while a child is in the womb, it is nourished (and in that sense “maintained”) <em>by the mother</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, it is also unclear to me whether a child that is still in the womb is a legal entity that has legal rights, including to maintenance. I say this because the Charter does not stipulate that a husband is obliged to “maintain” an unborn child. Furthermore, under the common law, an unborn child does not enjoy any separate legal personality: e.g., <em>Evan v Amicus Healthcare Ltd</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 77; <em>St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust v S</em> [1999] Fam 26 at [50]; <em>At the beginning of Life</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Journal/73556-M.xml')\">(2010) 22 SAcLJ 883</a> at [17], [18] and [37]. Accordingly, the right to maintenance does not arise until an unborn child is delivered – for this is when the child has an existence that is <em>physically separate</em> from the mother. It is also at this stage that the child has a <em>legal</em> identity – as evidenced by its birth certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Costs of hiring a helper</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, it is also inappropriate to order the Husband to pay – as <em>child</em> maintenance – the costs of hiring a helper after the unborn child is delivered. The purpose of engaging such a helper will not be for the exclusive benefit of the child. Rather, the helper is intended to assist <em>the Wife</em> – to alleviate her burden in taking care of the household, the daughter, and the newborn baby.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Application for interim spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Costs of hiring a helper</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The above views are not the end of the matter. This is because it is possible for the Wife to claim the costs of hiring a helper under <em>spousal</em> maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there will be two young children to look after once the unborn child is delivered. This heavy responsibility will fall on the Wife. She will not be able to rely on the Husband to provide the assistance because they are estranged and (in any event) he holds a full-time job. Apart from helping to look after the children, the helper can also assist the Wife to take care of the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in addition to alleviating the Wife’s burden, a helper can allow the Wife to rejoin the workforce as soon as possible. This will provide the Wife with financial independence and the ability to have an income to maintain herself, the children and the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the fact that the Wife has an income will also mean that there is less reliance on the Husband to finance her expenses. In other words, the Husband will also benefit from the employment of a helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Pregnancy-related medical expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Similarly, while the pregnancy-related medical expenses are not claimable as <em>child</em> maintenance, I am of the view that the Wife can claim these expenses as part of <em>spousal</em> maintenance. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is common for courts to order a husband to provide maintenance to cover expenses due to his wife’s medical condition – see, e.g., <em>AWX v AWY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0004.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 4</a> at [46] (wife needed hormone replacement therapy); <em>TEM v TEN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0238.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 238</a> at [37] to [39] (wife had overactive bladder, cytocele and rectocele); <em>WEK v WEL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27619-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 52</a> at [16] (wife had cancer). In line with these precedents, the Wife’s pregnancy-related medical expenses can be covered under spousal maintenance as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, when applying for spousal maintenance, it is permissible for a wife to claim for her personal expenses such as for personal grooming and recreation. It would be unreasonable if such expenses are covered under spousal maintenance but not pregnancy-related medical expenses. A mother goes through pain, suffering and health risks during pregnancy. It is only just and equitable that the father of the unborn child be compellable to provide financial support to ensure that the mother goes through this difficult journey safely and without having to worry about how she will be able to pay for the medical bills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s reasons for not paying</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Despite the above, the Husband submitted that he should not be ordered to pay for the Wife’s pregnancy-related medical expenses. He gave the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband could not be sure that the unborn child is his.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, given that the Wife chose to continue the pregnancy despite his objections, she should not look to him to finance the relevant expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Wife can tap on her UOB account which has $120,000+ in savings. Some of the funds in this account had come from his previous transfers for maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I am unable to accept the Husband’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Husband is the father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     With regards to the Husband’s first reason, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband does not deny that he had sexual relations with the Wife during the period when the unborn child was conceived, i.e., April 2024. There is no evidence that the Wife had sexual relations with any other man during this time. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the Husband is the unborn child’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, s 114(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 is relevant. It provides that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Where any person <em>was born</em> —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)    during the continuance of a valid marriage between his or her mother and any man; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)    within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage, the mother remaining unmarried,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">it is <em>presumed</em> that the person is the legitimate child of that man, <em>unless the contrary is proved</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Section 114(1) presumes that a man is the father of a child if it <em>is born</em> within a prescribed period. Strictly speaking, s 114(1) does not apply in the present case because the child which the Wife is carrying has not been born yet. That said, it must logically follow from s 114(1) that a man can be inferred to be the father of an unborn child if the child <em>will be born within the period prescribed</em> in s 114(1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     To sum-up, it is reasonable to infer that the Husband is the father of the unborn child. There is no need for the Wife to adduce further proof of the child’s paternity – such as by tendering a DNA report. If the Husband wishes to disprove the reasonable inference, then he is free to take the relevant actions <em>at his own costs</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife unilaterally decided to keep the pregnancy</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I now come to the Husband’s second reason – namely that the Wife should not expect him to finance her unilateral decision to continue with the pregnancy. According to him, having a second child will allow the Wife to demand more money from him – something that he does not want.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I am unable to accept the Husband’s views.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it ignores the fact that the Husband <em>had chosen</em> to engage in sexual relations with the Wife at the material time. It is <em>foreseeable</em> that such relations can lead to conception. The <em>natural consequence</em> of conception is the birth of a child. If the Husband did not want to incur the responsibility and expenses of an unwanted child, then he should not have engaged in sexual relations with the Wife in the first place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, abortion is a medically invasive procedure on the Wife’s body. Such a procedure carries risks. Given this, the Wife should have the final say on whether to terminate or keep a pregnancy. Her views should be respected. She should not be left to carry the burden of having and raising the child alone simply because the Husband wants to opt out of fatherhood for his own convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband’s view that the Wife will use the second child to extract more money from him overlooks the fact that a woman’s decision to continue with a pregnancy is rarely made for an ulterior motive. This is because by choosing to keep the unborn child, the Wife will end up with the challenges and hardship of pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare. The challenges and hardship on the Wife are likely to be disproportionately higher than those to be felt by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Wife has access to substantial funds</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Finally, I come to the Husband’s third reason for refusing to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses and costs of hiring a helper – i.e., his belief that the Wife has $121,447 in her UOB personal account ending with “229” (“<b>229 Account</b>”). To support this belief, the Husband referred me to the relevant bank records.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I find that the Husband’s belief is misconceived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The bank records are dated March 2024. According to the Wife, she had transferred $102,105 out from the 229 Account on 30 May 2024 to pay the downpayment for their HDB flat. This claim is supported by the relevant bank records.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the transfer of $102,105, this would mean that the Wife’s personal account would have about $19,342 left as of May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> – <em>assuming that there is no other withdrawal or deposit into the account between March and May 2024</em>. In my view, the balance in the Wife’s personal account is likely to be lesser by the time of this decision. This is because between June to October 2024, there is a draw down from the Wife’s personal account for the pregnancy-related medical expenses. This came to a total of $2,564.70.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Wife is in financial need</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Having determined that the Wife is unlikely to have access to a substantial amount of funds from the matrimonial assets, the next question is whether she is in financial need. This is a requirement for imposing interim maintenance order: see [5(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     To address this question, I note that in the lead up to, and after, the delivery of the unborn child, the Wife is likely to have to make the following payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Pregnancy-related medical expenses</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, there will be about five more checkups before the delivery in January 2025. The total costs of these checkups will be about $1,000 – as each checkup is likely to cost about $200. I accept this estimation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, the Wife estimated that the costs of delivering the unborn child would be around –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $7,822 to $9,132 (normal delivery), and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $$12,509 to $14,698 (caesarean delivery).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In my view, the delivery charges are high and incompatible with her income level. Based on the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital Estimated Delivery Bill Calculator, the estimated costs of the delivery would be around $2,870 (normal delivery) and $4,660 (caesarean delivery).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In my view, I more reasonable estimation of the costs of the delivery charges is about <em>$3,500</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Costs of hiring a helper</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife anticipated that the cost of hiring a helper would be $1,260/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The costs of hiring a helper depend on several factors, including the helper’s nationality, whether she has the relevant experience, and whether she is a new or a transfer maid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In my view, a more reasonable estimation for the costs of hiring a helper is <em>$800/month.</em> This estimation assumes that the Wife is likely to qualify for a reduced maid levy on the basis that she has two young children at the time of hire.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Personal expenses</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d_1\"></a>(d)     According to the Wife, her personal expenses are as follows.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.86%\"><col width=\"62.8%\"><col width=\"29.34%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$/month</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Utilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">150</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Personal grooming</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">180</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Travel</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">100</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(d)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Food and groceries</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">700</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1,130</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e_2\"></a>(e)     In my view, a more reasonable amount is <em>$800/month</em>.

In my view, this clause is clearly not applicable to MSS 1306 given the text in underscore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife did not rely on any term in the Deed for her applications in MSS 1306.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Before concluding, I wish to convey the following directly to the parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Husband</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the hearing, it is clear to me that you are very upset with your wife. According to you, she (i) had failed to make financial and other contributions towards the marriage and household expenses (including payments towards the purchase of a HDB flat), (ii) had been siphoning funds from your joint account(s) for her personal use, (iii) had caused you to be in debt so that you can make payments to the Wife, and (iv) had failed to take care of the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While I can understand your unhappiness, it is not the purpose of this hearing to resolve your deep-seated issues with your wife. The proper forum for that will be at the ancillary stage of the divorce proceedings. My decision in MSS 1306 will not prevent you from fully ventilating your position on the relevant issues at the ancillary hearing – including (i) the division of matrimonial assets, and (ii) whether it is better for you to be the daughter’s caregiver, and (iii) if so, for your wife to pay you maintenance instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Wife</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Just like your husband, you have also voiced your unhappiness regarding your marriage – including (i) having been “tricked” into signing the Deed and buying the HDB flat, (ii) your husband having stolen your money and property, and (iii) the broken promises made by him. However, unlike your husband who was calm and focussed throughout the hearing, you had behaved in an extremely discourteous and disruptive manner – at times, bordering on contempt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     You are to note that should you continue with such behaviour in future hearings, including at the ancillary stage of the divorce proceedings, you are at risk of being cited for contempt. Court decisions are not made based on who shouts the loudest or who can out-talk the other. Decisions are based on which party can present the more credible and reliable evidence – coherently and clearly.

They had two daughters. After more than two decades of marriage, the Husband filed for divorce on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October 2023, citing the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour as the reason for irretrievable breakdown of their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on the 25<sup>th</sup> of April 2024. Thereafter, parties charted a course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is in this context that the Wife has taken out an application for discovery <em>vide</em> SUM 3306/2024 (“SUM 3306”). During the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”) confirmed that the Wife was only proceeding on the following two items:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><u>Item 1:</u></b> Bank account statements for the following bank accounts for the period (January 2020 to May 2020 and January 2023 to December 2023):</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       OCBC account ending -57;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       POSB account ending -44;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       DBS account ending -46;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       DBS account ending -23.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><u>Item 2:</u></b> Bank account statements for a Standard Chartered Wealth Saver account ending -35 from the time the account was opened, till the time the account was closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is hornbook law that a party seeking discovery must demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to the hearing of the substantive matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       With regard to Item 1, the Wife explained that the bank statements are needed for two reasons. First, to ascertain why the Husband had received the sum of $45,000 from a third party, [X]. The Wife says that the Husband had told her, in a conversation, that he had lent this sum of money to [X]. The Husband’s account, however, is that [X] had transferred this sum to him to make investments on his behalf.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second reason the Wife gives is that these statements are needed to ascertain if the Husband had been dissipating assets. She points out that the Husband had, in April 2021, some $390,000 in his DBS account ending -6. However, in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) filed on 3 June 2024, the Husband discloses that he only has $8,903.73 in that account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, the documents which the Wife seeks disclosure of in Item 1 are certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would go towards the issue of whether the sum of $45,000 which [X] had sent to the Husband, was for an investment to be made on [X]’s behalf, or whether it was repayment for a loan which the Husband had made to [X]. It would also shed light on whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I note that the Husband has given his account of events relating to the sum of $45,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He has also explained the reason for the reduction in the balance in his DBS account ending -6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I must emphasise that, at the interlocutory stage, it is not for me to decide where the truth lies in relation to the various transactions which the Wife is disputing. The purpose of the discovery process is to ensure that all the relevant evidence is placed before the hearing judge, and also to allow parties the opportunity to evaluate their case: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14] citing <em>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0947.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 947</a> at [24] citing <em>Teo Wai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0573.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 573</a> at [41]. In that connection, a party only needs to demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As for the Husband’s objection to providing disclosure on the basis that it would be too costly for him to do so, I too, could not accept this argument. For one, the costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery. Although the court can depart from this starting point, and order that the party entitled to discovery “bear a whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such an order for the giving of discovery” (<em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [21] citing Family Justice Courts Practice Directions para 81(35) and (36); Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at p 945), I saw no reason to depart from this general position. After all, the Husband had, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, stated:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I also maintain that I have always provided a full and frank disclosure of my assets and finances as I have always kept good records of my finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Husband’s evidence, one would expect him to have kept copies of these bank statements. In any event, insofar as the Husband has stated that he would need to fork out, at the very least, $9,600 to obtain the statements which the Wife seeks,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> he did not put forward any documentary evidence from the banks to support his claim. As I had noted in my earlier judgment in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25    I would, however, observe that in a future case, it may well be open to the party giving discovery to seek liberty to apply for an order that the party entitled to discovery is to bear the entirety, or a portion of the costs that may be incurred in complying with the order for discovery. In doing so, that party must articulate their legal and factual basis for seeking such an order. Naturally, in deciding whether it is appropriate to make such an order, the court will consider all the relevant circumstances. This could include factors such as the quantum of such costs that had been incurred or were likely to be incurred, and whether there was any reasonable way to avoid incurring such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Finally, as to the Husband’s objection that the statements sought related to a period where divorce was not contemplated at all, the law is clear that it is indeed useful for the court to have an insight into parties’ finances during the breakdown of the marriage and prior to the filing of divorce. This is because, during the breakdown of the marriage, there is often a decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [9] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [79] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this connection, although the divorce was only filed in October 2023, I note from the Husband’s Statement of Particulars as well as parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> AOMs, that their marriage of some two decades, did not appear to have been an entirely happy one, and that their relationship had gone down the path of no return long before the divorce was filed. For instance, the Husband states, in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that their marital relations had begun to break down over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Wife also states, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had suffered “25 years of [p]hysical and [e]motional abuse” by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Apart from the various details which demonstrate that the parties’ relationship was strained years before the divorce, the Husband did also state, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, that the both of them always had “independence over [their] own bank accounts and finances” and that they would not “question each other on how” they chose to spend their own money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given this state of affairs, it appears that the Wife may not have had much knowledge, or involvement in the Husband’s finances. In that vein, the Wife’s request for the documents in Item 1 cannot be said to be a wholly unreasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the request in Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for the request in Item 2, the documents which the Wife seeks are, in my judgment, also relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. These bank statements would go towards verifying the Husband’s claim in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM that he used to hold the sum of $501,849 on behalf of his mother, and [X], for investment purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s main objection to giving disclosure in relation to Item 2 is that he no longer has the documents given that he has “disposed of all documents relating to this account”. I cannot accept this for two reasons. First, I find it rather strange that the Husband would dispose of these statements, especially given his claim that the money in this account belonged to other people. During the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Eunice Ong (“Ms Ong”) had told me that the Husband was careful with money and that he would keep the relevant statements where he had dealt with other people’s money. If this was indeed the case – then the Husband should have no difficulty in producing these bank statements. In any event, I note that the Husband has not provided proof that it would be impossible to obtain these statements by writing to the bank to request for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is also allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In summary, I therefore order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Schedule A of SUM 3306, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in his affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 10<sup>th </sup>of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As to the issue of costs, Ms Ong argued that parties should bear their own costs. Counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”), on the other hand, argued that the Wife should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given that the Wife had succeeded in her application, she is entitled to costs, which are fixed at $950 (all-in). In determining the quantum of costs, I took into account the fact that the Wife’s application was not a lengthy one and did not involve any novel points of law. The Husband is to pay this sum of $950 to the Wife by the 10th of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Ong and Ms Seetha for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 18(ff).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 20(xii).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 21.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2025-01-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)","title":"XHA v XHB","citation":"[2025] SGFC 6","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32763-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Luke Anton Netto (Netto & Magin LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHA v XHB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHA <em>v</em> XHB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Luke Anton Netto (Netto &amp; Magin LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHA — XHB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married on the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011. They welcomed a daughter to their family on the xx of November 2014. The Husband works as a Warrant Officer in the [xxx].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Wife, on the other hand, is currently unemployed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Details as to how their marriage broke down are set out in the Wife’s Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 2) (“SOP”). It is stated that the Wife felt that the Husband was “passive and unsupportive” of her emotional wellbeing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Although the Wife filed for divorce on 19<sup>th</sup> June 2023, it is clear, from her SOP, that their relationship had begun to deteriorate as early as 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the filing of the divorce, interim judgment was granted on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2024. Parties thus set course for the disposal of the ancillary matters. It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out her applications for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 3318/2024 (“SUM 3318”) and SUM 3376/2024 (“SUM 3376”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision in respect of SUM 3318 and 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The general principles relating to discovery and interrogatories are well established – that is, the court will only make the relevant orders if the requests for discovery or interrogatories are relevant and necessary: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition, it is also true that before an application for discovery or interrogatories may be taken out, a voluntary request to give discovery, or answer interrogatories, must first be made: Rule 63(4) and 69(5) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”). This forms the basis for the Husband’s objection to the Wife’s application in SUMs 3318 and 3376 – that because she did not put in a voluntary request for discovery or interrogatories, both her applications should be dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although the Wife was self-represented, it was apparent to me that she had done some research on the applicable procedures relating to the process of seeking discovery and interrogatories in family proceedings. It could not be said that the Wife was entirely ignorant of the relevant procedures – she had, after all, taken out a voluntary request for discovery in respect of other documents, and the Husband had provided his responses in respect of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       That being said, I am not inclined to dismiss the Wife’s application on the basis that she had failed to first make a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The matter had come before me, and it was perhaps more practical to deal with it on its substantive merits. After all, if I were to dismiss the Wife’s application for non-compliance with the FJR 2014, there was nothing barring her from making the same voluntary request – and then taking out another application in the event that she did not receive satisfactory responses from the Husband. The end result: a delay in bringing matters to a final conclusion, and more toing and froing between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What I have said above, however, must not be taken, or interpreted, as a basis for failing to comply with the applicable procedural rules. Even if the court is minded to look past any procedural defects and deal with the matter on its substantive merits, non-compliance with the applicable procedural rules is certainly a factor that may be accounted for when it comes to costs: see <em>eg</em>, Rules 854 and 857 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I turn now to deal first with the Wife’s application for interrogatories in SUM 3376. The interrogatories sought fell into two categories. The first were interrogatories relating to any bonuses the Husband may have received during the tenure of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Provide details of the gratuity bonuses received for each cycle of service in the [xxx], including the amounts received and the corresponding years (e.g., 6-year or 10-year cycles).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State when each gratuity bonus was paid and specify the account to which each payment was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Confirm whether the Defendant has signed on for life in the [xxx] and, if so, provide details of any annual bonuses received, including the amounts and dates of payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Provide details of the scheme signed, including the date of signing and any subsequent financial entitlements such as annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Luke Netto (“Mr Netto”), made the point that these interrogatories were a mere “fishing expedition” as the Wife had no proof that the Husband had received any gratuity bonuses which were not reflected in the bank statements which he had already disclosed, or that the Husband had indeed been hiding money from the Wife, or that he had been dissipating his assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterates that he only has one bank account into which his salary from the [xxx] is deposited.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I do not agree with Mr Netto’s characterisation of the Wife’s application as a “fishing expedition”. It might equally be said that it is precisely because the Wife has no proof that the Husband had not been hiding his assets – that is why she has to pose these interrogatories in order to obtain the information she needs to assess her case for the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my judgment, the interrogatories which the Wife sought (above at [10]) were certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It went towards the outstanding issues which included the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance. It would also go towards the issue of whether there had been any dissipation of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Items 1 – 3 of SUM 3376, but only for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The second category related to details of a safe deposit box which, according to the Wife, contained her personal jewellery that was now in the Husband’s possession:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Provide details regarding the safety deposit box opened jointly with the Plaintiff, including its closure status, the location of the items within, and any records of access to the box.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     During the hearing, Mr Netto argued that the Husband’s position was that the jewellery belonged to the Wife’s mother. In that vein, Mr Netto argued that if the Wife wished to assert a claim over the jewellery, which (allegedly) belonged to the Wife’s mother, then the proper thing was to follow the approach laid down in <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> (“<em>UDA</em>”) – in other words, the Wife should commence separate civil proceedings to obtain a declaration that the jewellery did belong to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The present case does not appear to fall neatly into the four situations described in <em>UDA</em> at [51]. The Wife’s ownership of the jewellery is disputed – but the Husband’s position is that the jewellery does not belong to him, but rather, the Wife’s mother. Having said that, insofar as it is alleged that the jewellery belongs to the Wife’s mother, I am not aware of any proceedings which the Wife’s mother may have brought to assert her alleged ownership over the jewellery (see <em>UDA</em> at [54]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     What is clear to me, however, is that the issue of whether these pieces of jewellery are indeed a matrimonial asset is one that will have to be decided at the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife had stated, in her first Affidavit of Asset and Means (“1<sup>st</sup> AOM”), that her position in relation to the jewellery was that these were gifts given to her on her wedding day and 21<sup>st</sup> birthday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Assuming that the jewellery were indeed gifts, one possible conclusion may be that they should be <em>excluded</em> from the matrimonial pool of assets: see s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To arrive at this conclusion, it must be established that: <b>a)</b> the jewellery does indeed belong to the Wife, and <b>b)</b> that the circumstances of their acquisition means that they should be excluded from the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Framed in this way, it is clear that the interrogatory posed by the Wife is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The interrogatory asks the Husband to provide details such as which pieces of jewellery were stored in the safe deposit box and their current location. The answers would go towards establishing whether the Wife owns the jewellery and whether they should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Item 4 of SUM 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 3318. The items which the Wife sought in respect of discovery mirrored that sought in her application for interrogatories. The first category of items concerned documents relating to the bonuses which the Husband had received during the course of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Documents showing the amount of gratuity bonuses received by the Defendant for each service cycle in the [xxx]. Include details for both the 6-year and 10-year cycles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    Bank statements of the account(s) where the gratuity and annual bonuses were deposited including POSB/DBS statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Documents confirming whether the Defendant signed on for life in the [xxx], including details of the specific scheme signed, the date of signing, and subsequent annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband objects to providing discovery on the basis that he only has a single bank account into which all his bonuses from the [xxx] have been deposited, and that it is hardly necessary for him to have to provide documents relating to the payment of all bonuses received since the start of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband also takes the position that the Wife’s request is nothing more than a fishing expedition given that she has not a shred of proof to show that he had been dissipating assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the same reasons I have set out above (at [12]), I do not think that the Wife’s request for discovery is a fishing expedition. As I had explained in an earlier judgment, one other function of the discovery process is to allow parties to “evaluate their cases and clarify issues in dispute”: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14]. The Husband’s responses to the Wife’s request for discovery would provide clarity as to whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I thus find that the Wife’s request for discovery as set out in Items 1 and 2 of SUM 3318 is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Husband is to comply with the request, but the period of disclosure shall be limited to the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024. This period would cover the years in which the Husband may have received gratuity bonuses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife’s request in Item 3, however, is disallowed. That request sought disclosure of documents confirming that the Husband had signed on “for life” including the details of his employment contract with the [xxx]. In my judgment, this request is hardly relevant or necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, especially given the orders which I have made above (at [25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The second category of items concerned documents relating to the safe deposit box containing jewellery which, according to the Wife, belonged to her:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Documents relating to the safety deposit box jointly opened by the Defendant and Plaintiff, including records of access, closure, and disposition of the items contained therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I had observed above (at [18] – [20]), it is clear to me that the issue of whether the jewellery is a matrimonial asset is likely to be raised at the hearing of the ancillary matters.

At the time the divorce was filed on 23 September 2023, the Wife was pregnant with the parties’ first child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       As to why their marriage broke down, details may be found in the Statement of Particulars as well as the Wife’s Defence. Interim judgment was granted on the 14<sup>th</sup> of February 2024, and parties set course for the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out this application for discovery in SUM 3413/2024 (“SUM 3413”). She sought the following items in discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the period January 2023 to July 2023, and March 2024 to August 2024, the transaction history for various accounts with DBS, Citibank and American Express (“Item 1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In relation to certain credit cards which the Husband had with Standard Chartered Bank which were allegedly lost or cancelled, the transaction history for these cards from January 2023, up to the point the cards were lost or cancelled (“Item 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard arguments from parties on 16 December 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is trite law that when it comes to applications for discovery, orders will only be made if the court is satisfied as to the relevance and necessity of the documents sought: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22] – [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Michael Han (“Mr Han”) argued that these documents were indeed relevant and necessary because: <b>a)</b> they dealt with “quintessential matrimonial assets”, and <b>b)</b> they went towards shedding light on the Husband’s monthly expenses which was relevant to the issue of child maintenance. Mr Han also highlighted that there was an allegation that substantial amounts of money had been transferred to various individuals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It was, however, apparent to me that the real dispute between parties lay in the relevant period of disclosure in relation to Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In that connection, counsel for the Husband, Ms Amelia Lim (“Ms Lim”) made the point that because the operative date for identifying the matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, the relevant period for disclosure for both Items 1 and 2 ought to be from the time the marriage had broken down irretrievably in August 2023 to the date of the interim judgment which had been granted in February 2024 (see above at [2]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On that basis, the Husband had already given disclosure of the relevant documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is indeed useful for the court to have an insight into parties’ finances during the breakdown of the marriage and prior to the filing of divorce proceedings: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [79] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19]. The rationale for this, as was explained in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em> at [19], is that during the breakdown of the marriage, there would be a “proportionate decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances and financial arrangements”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, although parties were agreed that the marriage had broken down by August 2023, it was clear to me, upon perusing both the Husband’s Statement of Particulars and the Wife’s Defence that their relationship was, at the start of 2023, already experiencing some strain. For example, the Husband writes, in his Statement of Particulars, that “[s]ometime in late 2022 or early 2023, he had become very frustrated” with the Wife’s online shopping habits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Wife on the other hand, set out in her Defence, that their marriage was, right from the beginning, short of emotional and physical intimacy – she set out instances of how the Husband would rebuff her efforts at intimacy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Given this, I considered that the starting period of disclosure in January 2023 was indeed a reasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Turning to address the ending period of disclosure, I do not accept Ms Lim’s argument that the relevant period for disclosure should end with the grant of the interim judgment. While it is true that the date of the interim judgment is generally taken as the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets – as I had noted in an earlier judgment, it must be remembered that this is not a rule writ in stone: <em>XAY v XAZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 60</a> at [11]. The court does have the discretion to depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case warrant it: <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [34] – [36]; <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Ms Lim did raise the point, during the hearing before me, that if the court hearing the ancillary matters did eventually decide to use a date after the grant of the interim judgment as its starting point in determining the pool of matrimonial assets, the court could always ask parties to tender copies of their bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This is, at first blush, an attractive argument. However, it overlooks the point of the discovery process – that it is not only meant to ensure that all the relevant evidence is placed before the judge hearing the matter (see <em>XCL v XCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a> at [4]; <em>VisionHealthOne Corp Pte Ltd v HD Holdings Pte Ltd and others (Chan Wai Chuen and another, third parties)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 9 at [20]), but it also allows parties to evaluate their cases and clarify issues in dispute (see <em>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0947.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 947</a> at [24] citing <em>Teo Wai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0573.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 573</a> at [41]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In this vein, the documents which the Wife sought for the period after the grant of the interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, from March to August 2024) were indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would allow parties to evaluate their positions as to whether the operative date for determining the matrimonial pool of assets should indeed be taken as the date of the interim judgment. And even if one accepts that the date of the interim judgment would remain as the operative date, these documents would have a bearing on the issue of child maintenance as they cast light on the state of the Husband’s finances after the grant of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore allow the Wife’s application for discovery in Items 1 and 2. It is ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Annex A of SUM 3413, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 17<sup>th</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Parties are to write in with their submissions on the costs of SUM 3413, which shall be no longer than 3 pages. This shall be done no later than 10 January 2025. The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Lim and Mr Han for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at paras 16 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at paras 14 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 4(e).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defence at paras 2(i) – 2(l).</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4676 of 2023 (Summons No 3168 of 2024)","title":"XGI v XGJ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 5","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32716-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh & Co) for the plaintiff","Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XGI v XGJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGI <em>v</em> XGJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32716-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 5</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4676 of 2023 (Summons No 3168 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh &amp; Co) for the plaintiff; Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XGI — XGJ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 3168/2024 (“SUM 3168”). That summons had been taken out by the Wife who sought leave to file a joint affidavit from her four daughters to address issues relating to certain items of gold jewellery. My decision in respect of SUM 3168 can be found in <em>XGI v XGJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32622-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 110</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ respective submissions on the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband’s position was that the issue of costs should be addressed at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In any case, parties should bear their own costs as they are both legally aided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On the other hand, the Wife’s position was that, although both parties were legally aided, the Husband should still be liable for costs, to the tune of $2500, pursuant to s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAA”) as he had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. These costs should be paid to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where costs are sought against legally aided persons, there are two relevant provisions (<em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). The first is s 12(4)(<em>c</em>) of the LAA which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where any Grant of Aid is so filed, the aided person —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    is not, except where express provision is made in this Act, liable for costs to any other party in any proceedings to which the Grant of Aid relates; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second is s 14 of the LAA. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Court may order payment of costs by aided person in certain event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.—(1)    Where it appears to a court that any of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3) exists in relation to an aided person, the court may order the aided person to pay the costs of all or any of the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Director;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the solicitor who acted for the aided person;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In subsection (1), a reference to an “aided person” includes, in any case where the Grant of Aid has been cancelled before the making of the order, the person who immediately before the cancellation was the aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Grant of Aid issued to the aided person has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the aided person acted improperly in bringing or defending any legal proceedings, or in the conduct of those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where an order is made under subsection (1), the costs must be taxed as if the party ordered to pay costs were not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The costs so ordered to be paid must, unless otherwise directed by the order, include —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), were expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or were advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs of the Director or the solicitor who acted for the aided person ordered to be paid under subsection (1) include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5), then if any amount is recovered by the Director in respect of such costs, the same must be applied in the first instance in or towards the satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that the Wife is invoking s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) to argue that the Husband should be liable for costs despite being legally aided, she bears the burden of showing that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. In that vein, the mere fact that the Husband did not prevail in his bid to have SUM 3168 dismissed is not, in of itself, evidence that he had acted improperly. The Wife must put forward evidence to show that the Husband had conducted his “defence in a way that a reasonable [respondent] would not”: <em>Anpex Pte Ltd v Cheng Yong Sun and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29042-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 294</a> at [4].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s basis for saying that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168 appears to be that the Husband was lying in his affidavits when it came to the issue of the gold jewellery. The Wife points out that in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means, he had alleged that the jewellery was removed by the Wife from the matrimonial flat, and that the jewellery had been acquired during the course of their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, appears to shift his position because in a Reply Affidavit filed later on the 12<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, he denied the “existence and/or true value of the…gold jewellery items” which had been purchased by the Wife and their children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the circumstances, the costs of SUM 3168 shall be reserved to the judge hearing the ancillary matters. It is apparent to me that the issue of whether the Husband had acted improperly in resisting the Wife’s application is linked to the issue of who had bought and paid for the gold jewellery, as well as the truth of whatever the Husband had said in the various affidavits he had filed. These are matters to be decided by the judge hearing the ancillary matters, and the judge’s findings in respect of these issues may have a bearing on whether the Husband had indeed acted improperly in resisting the Wife’s application in SUM 3168.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As a final point, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions on Costs at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions on Costs at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Applicant seeking costs on the basis that he had been partially successful in his application to vary orders relating to his daughter’s care and control and access","Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Respondent seeking costs on the basis that the applicant had acted unreasonably by failing to resolve the issues amicably without the need for litigation","Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Approach to awarding costs in matrimonial proceedings"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/D No. 1721 of 2023 (FC/SUM No. 2056 of 2024)","title":"XER v XES","citation":"[2025] SGFC 4","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32715-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Khin Wee (M/s I.R.B.

In this judgement, I will explain the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin by setting out the applicable principles. They are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Starting position</em>. Under of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR</b>”), the starting position is that “costs should follow the event” – i.e., in usual cases, the successful party should be given the costs of the application or action: r 852(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Therapeutic justice</em>. However, the FJR also provides that a court is free to depart from the starting position if the “circumstances of the case” warrant it: r 852(2). In this regard, courts <em>frequently decline to make costs orders</em> at the end of matrimonial proceedings: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<b><em>JBB</em></b>”) at [24] to [27]. There are at least two reasons for this. <em>First</em>, it is often hard to say which party has “succeeded” in such proceedings. <em>Second</em>, a costs order may also be perceived as a signal that one party has “won” and the other has “lost”. Courts prefer not to send such a signal as this may increase acrimony and discontent between the parties – and thus undermine the aims of therapeutic justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Parties’ conduct.</em> The judicial preference of not ordering costs does not mean that costs orders will never be made in matrimonial proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       This is because when determining whether there is a need to make costs orders, courts are <em>statutorily obliged</em> to consider the <em>parties’ conduct</em> before and during the proceedings. This includes considering whether they have made any attempt to resolve their dispute: r 854 of the FJR (“must”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In this regard, a court “may” make a costs order, <em>including against a successful party</em>, if a party “has failed to establish any claim or issue which he has raised”, and “has thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted or added to the costs or complexity [of the proceedings]”: r 865 of the FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Courts have held that a costs order would be justified –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Where one party had made a genuine and reasonable offer to settle the matrimonial proceedings, and the matter could have been settled without the need for litigation: <em>WLL v WLM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29872-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 30</a> at [7], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       To signal that the adversarial stance taken by a party is not acceptable in a family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To sum up – it is appropriate to make costs orders to deter conduct which is contrary to the principles of therapeutic justice. If the appropriate signal is not sent, then parties who act reasonably may feel exploited by those who do not subscribe to such principles. Over time, confidence in the practice of therapeutic justice will be eroded and this is detrimental to our family justice system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs ought to be ordered against the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Following from [4] above, whether the Father has succeeded in part, or has been “completely unsuccessful” in SUM 2056 is not determinative of whether costs should be ordered: see [2(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Instead, the more pertinent issue is whether the Father’s or the Mother’s conduct of SUM 2056 warrants a costs order against him/her: <em>JBB</em> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On this issue, I find that a costs order should be made against the Father. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 1 and 2 – Sale of matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with Prayers 1 and 2. They are the Father’s application –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     for extension of time to sell the matrimonial flat: Prayer 1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to have sole conduct of such a sale: Prayer 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9        <em>Father’s allegations</em>. To support these prayers, the Father alleged the following in an affidavit dated 30 August 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">36.    There is currently <em>no confirmation when</em> such completion will be, <em>if at all</em>. There is a chance that the completion may eventually be called off given the current buyer’s increasing financial penalties for delaying completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37.    It is <em>now 30 August 2024</em>, and the Matrimonial Flat’s completion is <em>still being delayed indefinitely</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">38.    Parties thus now require an extension of time for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The above allegations give the impression that as of 30 August 2024 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The completion for the sale of the flat had been delayed indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father did not have any confirmation as to when the completion would take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He did not know if the completion would ever happen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Allegations are false</em>. The Father’s allegations are clearly false given the following undisputed evidence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In a letter dated 21 August 2024 (i.e., nine days <em>before</em> the Father’s affidavit was filed), HDB had already written to the Mother and him to <em>confirm</em> the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The “<em>effective</em> date for resale” of the flat “<em>has been fixed</em> on <u>30/8/2024</u>” (underscore in original text, italics added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father and the Mother were to pay the flat’s “service/conservancy charges up to 30/08/24” with the town council.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]here should be no outstanding service/conservancy and lift upgrading charges due to the Town Council on the resale effective date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There is no suggestion that the completion date of 30 August 2024 would be postponed. In fact, in so far as HDB is concerned, the <em>completion was to proceed as scheduled</em>. This is clear from two letters (dated 22 August 2024) which HDB had sent to the parties. In these letters, HDB specifically informed them of the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The parties had to pay $38,886.68 to settle the completion of account for the resale of the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “The completion of the resale transaction has been scheduled for you to <em>sign the legal documents</em> and <em>hand over the keys</em> to the flat”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The completion would be on <em>30 August 2024</em> at <em>3.30 pm</em> at the HDB Hub, Resale Office. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It is clear that the Father and the Mother had no intention to postpone the completion date of 30 August 2024. In a document dated 22 August 2024, the Father had confirmed with HDB that the Mother and he “<em>will handover the house keys</em> as there are no extension of stay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There is also no evidence to show that the buyer(s) had between 21 to 30 August 2024 asked to postpone the completion fixed on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The completion eventually proceeded on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Father’s position on the false allegations</em>. The Father denied that the allegations were false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His counsel submitted unconvincingly that (i) the Father’s allegations referred to the “actual act of completion where parties sign all the documents and complete the transaction”, and (ii) 30 August 2024 was only the “anticipated completion date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s counsel also submitted that the allegations were merely “outdated” and not false. To support this submission, counsel stated that the Father’s affidavit was confirmed on 29 August 2024 and signed in the morning of 30 August 2024 – i.e., <em>before</em> the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I find these submissions to be disingenuous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Father could have waited until <em>after</em> 3.30 pm (i.e., the scheduled completion time) to file his affidavit. If the completion did not proceed as scheduled, he could then state this accordingly in his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, based on the eLit records, the Father’s affidavit was filed only at 5.42 pm – i.e., two hours <em>after</em> the time fixed for the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, after the completion of the flat, the Father would have known that (1) the completion had concluded successfully and (2) the evidence/impression which he had conveyed in [9] and [10] are “erroneous” (to use counsel’s description). During the hearing, the Father’s counsel agreed that a reasonable person would have taken steps to correct this “error” – e.g., by expeditiously informing his counsel to clarify the matter during the case conference on 10 September 2024 or by filing a supplemental affidavit. The Father had failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Unnecessary work done</em>. As a result of the Father’s conduct (false allegations and failure to correct them), the Mother had to seek the leave of court to file a further affidavit to clarify that the flat had already been sold. This affidavit was filed on 17 September 2024. It was only after this further affidavit that the Father’s counsel informed the Mother’s counsel that Prayers 1 and 2 would be withdrawn. This took place only on 23 September 2024 – i.e., about three weeks after the completion of the resale of the matrimonial flat. By then, unnecessary work has been done by the Wife and her counsel to address Prayers 1 and 2. The Father’s conduct is clearly unacceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 3 – Variation of Daughter’s caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to Prayer 3 of SUM 2056, which is the Father’s application to replace the Mother as the Daughter’s caregiver. By way of a quick re-cap, the Father had made the application on two grounds. <em>First</em>, he had discovered his Daughter’s photos on social media which show her to be in an allegedly inappropriate pose and in the company of “strangers”. According to the Father, this showed that the Mother had failed to protect the Daughter’s interests. <em>Second</em>, he alleged that the Mother had denied him access to the Daughter: Judgement at [12] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I dismissed Prayer 3 because I found it to be dubious and “utterly devoid of merit”: Judgement at [23] to [35]. There is no evidence to show that the Father had approached the Mother to clarify matters <em>before</em> seeking this prayer. In my view, he could have addressed his concerns expeditiously and easily by simply checking with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 4 and 5 – Variation of non-family members clause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I now turn to Prayers 4 and 5. The Father had wanted the following clause to be completely deleted from the AM Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother objected to the complete deletion of this clause because she was concerned for the Daughter’s safety if she was with strangers. The Mother was however prepared to be flexible, and she proposed the following variation to the non-family members clause:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Save for the Plaintiff’s romantic partner, the </u> <del>The Plaintiff’s</del> access shall not be in the presence of non-family members<u>, unless the Plaintiff obtains the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I note that as early as 2 August 2024, the Mother had already proposed her variation in [17] to the Father in her Offer To Settle (“<b>OTS</b>”). The Father did not accept the offer. Neither did he attempt to address the Mother’s concerns, e.g., by counter-proposing suitable text. It is the Father’s case that he did not trust her enough to negotiate on a mutually acceptable access clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I agree with the Mother that Prayers 4 and 5 could have been resolved much earlier if the Father had adopted a problem-solving approach and proposed modifications to the Mother’s OTS.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Indeed, I had noted that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… during the proceedings, the Father had largely stuck to his positions and did not make much effort to address the Mother’s concerns arising from his application. In contrast, in line with the spirit of therapeutic justice, the Mother had shown flexibility and reasonableness – e.g., by suggesting suitable language for varying the access orders.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I eventually varied the non-family members’ clause as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>ii</u>)    <b><u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[variation in underscore] [bolding added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although I had eventually allowed Prayers 4 and 5, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother’s variations and the ones that I have ordered are substantively similar, save the text in bold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Father did not make any contribution towards the formulation of the varied clause that I have ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 6 – Modes of child access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, I come to Prayer 6. In this prayer, the Father had sought to expand the manner in which he could exercise access to the Daughter. I had found the Father’s proposed variations in Prayer 6 to be “problematic”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I eventually accepted the Mother’s proposed variations which, in my view, “strikes the right balance between flexibility and certainty regarding the manner of the handover”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother’s proposed variations are not new – she had already proposed them to the Father in her OTS in August 2024. In my view, it is unreasonable for him to reject the Mother’s proposed variations. Litigation on Prayer 6 could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To sum-up, I agree with the Mother that in relation to the issues in SUM 2056, valuable time and resources have been wasted because of the Father’s uncompromising stance, even when she had made a reasonable OTS. The Father has failed to substantiate his bare allegation that “it was reasonable for [him] to not try to negotiate further with the [Mother]” at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father cannot continue with such an attitude. The Daughter is only eight years old. For the next 13 years, he will need to work together with the Mother on matters relating to their Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, it is necessary to make a costs order against the Father to clearly signal to him that he needs to be more reasonable moving forward, and to compensate the Mother for the costs that she had unnecessarily incurred in the Father’s pursuit of SUM 2056.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Amount of costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, an order of <b>$6,500 (all in)</b> would be appropriate in this case. In coming to this amount, I have considered (a) the extent of work done, and (b) the fact that the Mother had shown flexibility in trying to resolve the issues early – by making an OTS and through the facilitative conduct of her counsel during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The terms of the OTS are substantially similar to those that I have ordered. Admittedly, the Mother’s proposal regarding the non-family members clause did not go far enough: Judgement at [48] and [49]. That said, I do not think that this is due to a lack of genuine efforts on her part to resolve the access issue. I am satisfied that her OTS was made in good faith. If only the Father had kept an open mind and proposed suitable language to the non-family members’ clause to address the Mother’s concern, the issue could have been resolved with the need for litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father is to pay $6,500 to DBS Account No. 014-904xx by 27 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32      <em>First</em>, to support his claim that it was not reasonable for him to negotiate with the Mother, the Father submitted that after my decision on Prayers 4 and 5, the Wife had refused to allow him to bring the Daughter to visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I am unable to accept the Father’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     To support his submissions, the Father had relied on his chat records with the Mother. I find that these records are <em>not admissible</em> – they are annexed to the Father’s submissions and are not adduced by way of affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father had omitted the rest of the parties’ conversation, and that there was no evidence that the Daughter could not visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations. It is the Mother’s case that after my variations on the relevant clauses, the Father’s child access has proceeded smoothly. She is prepared to adduce the relevant evidence to support her case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Second</em>, my decision in this case seeks to emphasise the point that the practice of therapeutic justice is not merely a vague concept. It is a key principle in our family justice system, with real practical implications on how parties are expected to resolve their matrimonial disputes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>__________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>ANNEX A</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>DETAILS OF PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS</b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"9.34%\"><col width=\"44.86%\"><col width=\"45.8%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father’s submissions</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s submissions</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Outcome of SUM 2056</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father’s “main point” is that he has succeeded in part for Prayers 4 and 5, as well as Prayer 6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father is “completely unsuccessful” in SUM 2056.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Out of the six prayers, two were withdrawn (Prayers 1 and 2), one was dismissed (Prayer 3), and three were allowed in part (Prayers 4 – 6).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>2</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Was it necessary to commence SUM 2056</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Yes –</b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Prayers 3 to 7 – These were granted in part.

Having considered parties’ evidence and submissions, I made various orders relating to the child’s care arrangements, including an order for the Defendant Mother to have sole care and control of the child, and orders providing for the Father’s access to the Child. The Father has since appealed against the whole of my decision. I now set out herein the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties are both Indian nationals. They married on 4 August 2017 in India. The Father is on an Employment Pass, while the Mother is on an S Pass, that was extended until 10 August 2027.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The child of the marriage was born on 8 November 2018 (the “Child”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father had been living in Singapore prior to the marriage. The Mother lived in India, but moved to Singapore to join the Father after the marriage. The parties lived in rental premises throughout the marriage, first in a property at Pegu Road, and thereafter in an apartment at Henderson Road, where the Father continued to live in as at the date of hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that sometime in April 2023, the Mother left their rented apartment with the Child, taking the Child’s passport with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Sometime in May 2024, the Mother and the Child travelled to India. While the Mother returned to Singapore thereafter, the Child remained there, living with the Mother’s parents. The Father did not know that the Child had travelled to India or that the Child has been living there until the Mother revealed this at a Family Dispute Resolution (“FDR”) Conference on 5 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 29 May 2024, the Father filed the present application. Sometime in August 2024, the Mother filed for a divorce in Bangalore, India. In this regard, the Mother asked that the present proceedings be stayed for the court in Bangalore to determine the Child’s custody issues. As there was no application filed by the Mother to stay the present proceedings, I declined to do so, and proceeded to hear this matter on 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Apart from the present proceedings, the parties had previously applied for a personal protection order against each other: the Mother in SS 1624/2022, and the Father in SS 635/2023. A PPO was issued in respect of SS 1624/2022, restraining the Father from committing family violence against the Mother. SS 635/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s application </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In his application, the Father sought the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Mother be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother shall handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping, and that the Father’s solicitors shall not handover the passport to anyone until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the Father be granted interim care and control of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That the Father be granted interim liberal access to the Child pending the resolution of the matter, or until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     That the Mother produces the Child before the court within 7 days of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Among the reasons given by the Father, the Father said that the Mother has been unduly restrictive with his access to the Child. The Father said that the Mother would make various unilateral decisions without consulting him, and suggested that she has been less than cooperative as a parent. The Father said that the Mother is unsuited to be the Child’s main caregiver because “<em>she has no qualm [sic] in using [the Child] as a tool to control the Father and she does not care whether there is a healthy father relationship between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Father said that there is a <em>“pressing need for him to see the Child to determine if further medical care is required</em>” in the wake of the Child’s operation in April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Father says that he has “<em>suffered from being completely cut off from [the Child] since November 2023 and [he] can no longer endure it as [he] truly miss[es] [the Child] a lot</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When faced with an application filed under Section 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934, the court is foremost guided by doing what is in the Child’s best interests. The court is less concerned about achieving equity or equality between parents. There is, after all, no standing presumption that both parents should have equal responsibility over, or equal time with, their child (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> at [12] and [20]). Each party’s behaviour toward the other, or indeed their respective contributions toward the marriage, are relevant to the extent that it affects the child in question. This may be the case where, for example, a party’s actions may have a direct or indirect impact on their ability to care for their child, or on their child’s relationship with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I therefore examined the reasons for the Father’s application, and considered, based on his reasons, how the orders sought by the Father would advance the Child’s best interests, rather than that of either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence provided, I found some force to the Father’s arguments that the Mother had not been cooperative as a joint parent and that she had not been facilitative of the Father spending time with the Child. For instance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From April 2023 to the time of hearing, which was a span of nearly one and a half years, the Father only met the Child once in person. This was in public, and in the Mother’s presence, at VivoCity on 8 November 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from this brief access in November 2023, the Father only had two video calls with the Child which lasted for about three to four minutes each;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whereas the Child had been attending a preschool at Redhill Close, the Mother withdrew the Child on 31 December 2022 and enrolled him into a different preschool at Henderson Crescent. The Mother did not consult the Father, nor did she inform him of this before effecting the withdrawal and enrolment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother arranged for the Child to undergo an adenoidectomy in India in April 2024 without consulting or informing the Father. The Mother says that she informed the Father’s mother, but never received any queries from her or the Father. At the hearing, the Mother said that she did not think that the Father would be interested, and acknowledged that she should have informed the Father but did not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There was evidence that even when the parties were living together, the Mother was less than forthcoming about the Child’s whereabouts. For instance, WhatsApp messages between 8 October to 29 October 2022 suggested that there were various occasions where the Father would ask to see the Child, or ask about the Child, without any response from the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The WhatsApp messages on 21 and 22 January 2023 suggested that the Mother had taken the Child on a “stay holiday” without informing the Father. Despite the Father’s message at 8.54am on 22 January 2023 requesting the Mother to bring the Child back earlier for lunch, or for her to inform him of the Child’s whereabouts and the time they would be returning, the Mother only responded to the message at 11.47pm without providing any of the information sought, though they had yet to return at that late hour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     There was also some evidence that the Mother had spoken uncharitably of the Father in front of the Child. For instance, a transcript of a recorded conversation shows that the Mother told the Child that the Father “<em>is not your father because he doesn’t take care. He is not your father. You no need to call him Abbu. He doesn’t take any responsibility.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> At pages 168 to 169 of FA1, a transcript of another recorded conversation suggests that the Child told the Father that the Mother “<em>threatens [the Father]</em>” and that he is “<em>also afraid of her</em>”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On the evidence provided, when the Father tried to initiate access, the Mother appeared slow to respond, or else did not respond at all. For instance, on 22 April 2023, the Father requested for some video call access, but the Mother did not respond to this at all. On 9 September 2023, the Father requested to see the Child at 3.00pm the next day, but the Mother only responded at 3.09pm on 10 September 2023 to say that she was unwell, after the Father sent another message at 2.37pm that day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Taken at face value, the Mother’s actions, as described by the Father, suggest that she may have been inclined to fetter the Father’s time with the Child and to exclude him from making significant decisions relating to the Child. However, I also noted the following, which I found to have diluted the strength of the Father’s claim and reduced the culpability of the Mother’s actions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Despite the Father’s claims that he had made multiple requests for access, I noted that there was limited evidence showing this. For instance, a screenshot of WhatsApp messages between them showed that after the Father’s request for a video call with the Child on 22 April 2023, which the Mother did not respond to, the Father did not send another message or make any other request to the Mother until 8 August 2023, when the Father requested to take the Child out for the afternoon.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence provided on affidavit that explained this gap in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Similarly, there was no evidence of the Father asking about the Child’s well-being, whether on a consistent basis or otherwise. In this regard, there appears to be some truth to the Mother’s messages sent to the Father on 10 September 2023 at 3.16pm and 3.24pm, namely that the Father only wanted to spend time with the Child at his own convenience, and that he had not been asking how the Child was doing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence that the Father replied to these messages, and the Father did not provide an explanation for these messages in his affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, with respect to the Father’s access on 8 November 2023, the Mother’s evidence was that when they met, the Father “<em>could not control his anger and temper and began shouting and cursing at [the Mother] in front of [the Child</em>]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This was supported by a screenshot of WhatsApp messages she had sent to the Father, recording her displeasure at how the access went. The Father did not specifically dispute this, nor did he adduce any further WhatsApp messages to refute or to provide further context to the Mother’s messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In any event, while the Father argues that the Mother’s actions may have had a consequential adverse effect on the Father’s relationship with the Child, the relationship between the parent and child is but one of the factors that the court considers in its assessment the child’s welfare (see <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [51]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the balance of things, I was not persuaded that the Father should have sole care and control of the Child, as sought by him. Rather, I was of the view that the Child would benefit from continuing to reside with his primary caregiver. On the evidence, this appeared to be the Mother, not the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     One month after the Child was born, the Mother returned to India with the Child. The Child therefore spent his first year under the Mother’s primary care with limited physical involvement from the Father. After the Mother and the Child returned to Singapore in December 2019, there was little evidence adduced to suggest that the Father took over the role as the Child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Father claimed to have been very much involved in the Child’s life, the Father’s best evidence of his involvement was that he fed his son well, took him to his favourite indoor playgrounds alone, and purchased baby supplies for him. He said that on occasion, he would “<em>give [the Child] a shower, put on a suit, and clean his poop</em>”, and that every time the Child was ill, he would take him to the clinic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Father also pointed to his efforts in applying for a student pass for the Child, but I did not think that this necessarily indicated his level of involvement in the Child’s day to day affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At paragraph 3.7 of MA1, the Mother alleged that the <em>“only interest [the Father] showed in [the Child] was limited to taking him out to indoor playgrounds for a couple of hours over the weekend or taking him to his sister’s house in Jurong East”</em>. The Father had the opportunity to respond to this but did not do more than make a blanket statement that “<em>these allegations are false</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Father never provided much detail as to any other activities or events he would take the Child to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On the face of the evidence, I could not accept that the Father was a primary, or even an equal, caregiver during the marriage. I found that the Father likely bore the responsibility of being the main breadwinner of the family, but took on more of a supporting role when it came to parenting the Child. In contrast, the fact that the Mother was primarily responsible for caring for the Child during the marriage, as well as the Mother’s ability to physically care for the Child, were not seriously disputed. Rather, the Father’s main charge about the Mother’s suitability as a caregiver was that “<em>the [Mother] is not a suitable caregiver to [the Child] presently given her tendency to destroy the parental link between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I ultimately found that the Child had, throughout his life, mostly been reliant on the Mother and that it would be remiss to remove the Child from the Mother’s care. As the Child’s primary caregiver, the Mother would be better placed to attend to the Child’s physical and emotional needs, and provide the Child with a sense of stability amidst this period of transition. Further, I found that much of the Father’s concerns may be addressed through appropriate orders on custody and access, and do not in itself justify the order of sole care and control that he sought. <u>I therefore found that the Mother should be granted sole care and control of the Child</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     With respect to the Father’s access to the Child, the Father’s position was that he should have liberal access to the Child, if care and control was not granted to him. The Mother did not object to the Father having access, but said that this should take place in India. Otherwise, any access in Singapore should be in her presence, and should not be accompanied by any other members of the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the Mother said that the Child has been much happier in India, there was little evidence to support this. The Mother provided scant details of the Child’s routine and living arrangements to the court, and it appears that prior to the FDR Conference on 5 August 2024, the Mother did not even inform the Father of this significant development. I did not find the Mother’s decision to take the Child to Bangalore for a surgery, and then to effectively relocate the Child there, to be reasonable or justified. If this surgery was indeed necessary, I did not see why the Mother could not undergo the surgery here in Singapore. The Mother did not satisfactorily explain this (and never cited finances as a reason for doing so).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Further, the Mother’s case that the Child’s best interests would be best served in India was not substantiated on the evidence. The circumstances of the Mother taking the Child to India, without informing the Father and without any court application to do so, lend itself to the inference that the Mother herself may not have felt that she had such a strong case in that regard. I found the Mother’s reasons for not informing the Father of her decisions to have been unsatisfactory. I therefore did not deem it appropriate to effectively affirm the Mother’s actions by ordering any access to take place in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Rather, I found on the circumstances of the case that the Father should have regular access with the Child, and that such access should take place in Singapore. Notwithstanding the Mother’s misgivings, there is no evidence to suggest that the Father is unable to exercise access with the Child, particularly where it is not disputed that he had previously taken the Child out on his own to indoor playgrounds when the Child was younger. The Father should be given the opportunity to establish – or re-establish – his relationship with the Child, and to be the parent that the Mother says he has never been.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, given the length of time since the Father had any substantial time with the Child, I was of the view that such access should be exercised on an incremental basis. I did not find the liberal access suggested by the Father to be in the Child’s best interests, and I also noted from the requests made by the Father to the Mother for access over the past one and a half years that he never asked for any overnight access with the Child, or even for a period of much longer than a few hours. As the Child has been living in India for nearly six months as at the time of the hearing, I allowed a transition period of two weeks before access was to commence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I therefore ordered that the <u>Father has reasonable access to the Child</u> in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from the week commencing 25 November 2024, the Father shall spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall continue to spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child.

In addition, the Father is to have access to the Child for dinner after school on a weekday. The Mother is not to be present during this access without the Father’s consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As neither party raised any concrete proposals for access arrangements, I left it to the parties to make the necessary arrangements between themselves. However, <u>if the parties were unable to agree to this in writing within 7 days of my order</u>, the Father’s access was to take place as such:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from 30 November 2024, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the above period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall handover the Child to the Father at the void deck of the Father’s place of residence, and the Father shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. In addition, the Father shall have access on Wednesdays, after the Child’s school, or from 5.00pm (whichever is earlier) until 8.00pm. The Father shall pick the Child up directly from school and shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given my above orders for the Mother to personally bring the Child for the access sessions, I did not find it necessary to order that the Child be produced before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While the Father did not make any express prayers for custody orders (despite him seeking an order for sole custody in his written submissions), I found that it would be beneficial to make an order for the <u>parties to share joint custody of the Child</u>. I was of the view that in the context of this case, such an order clearly affirming both parties’ equal right to make major decisions for the Child such as the Child’s choice of school and the Child’s country of residence would avert any acrimony between the parties stemming from one party making any such decisions unilaterally, which may inadvertently have an impact on the Child’s relationship with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With respect to prayers 1 and 2 of the Father’s application (namely for the Mother to be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders, and for the Mother to handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping pending further orders), given that the Child was already overseas, and given my orders for the Mother to have sole care and control of the Child, I made no orders with respect to these prayers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In relation to the issue of costs, the Father sought costs of $4,000 (all-in). The Father’s counsel argued that this application was necessitated by the Mother’s actions, that the Father’s application was mainly for access, that it was the Mother who made it difficult for the parties to resolve the matter, and that the hearing of the matter was delayed, with a number of case conferences necessitated before the hearing of the matter. The Mother’s response was that she could not afford to pay costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I made no order as to costs. The Father had expressly sought an order for sole custody and care and control, and never made any concessions in this regard. I therefore did not agree that his application was primarily about the issue of access. In this regard, the Father did not find any success in his requests for sole custody and care and control. I also did not agree that the parties’ inability to resolve the matter prior to hearing was solely the Mother’s fault. I noted that the parties had been fixed to attend FDR Mediation, but that it was the Father who chose to withdraw from this after parties had attended the FDR Conference. I also noted that there were only two case conferences convened prior to the hearing on 16 October 2024, which was not an unduly high number, and that the Mother had only filed one affidavit in this matter, whereas the Father had filed four of his own. I overall did not find any order for costs to be warranted in the circumstances of the case.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 300 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 28 May 2024 (“FA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 13 June 2024 (“FA2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 13 of the Father’s Written Submissions dated 7 October 2024 (“FS1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 14 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Pages 77 to 81 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Pages 212 to 215 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Page 151 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 168 and 169 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Page 272 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 271 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Page 274 and 275 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 3.10 of the Mother’s Affidavit dated 26 August 2024 (“MA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 on page 139 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 12 September 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of FA2</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial proceedings – Jurisdiction – Whether parties who have consented to the grant of interim judgment entitled to a stay of ancillary reliefs on the ground of forum non conveniens","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Pre-nuptial agreements – Whether case management stay should be granted pending conclusion of foreign proceedings on validity of pre-nuptial agreement","Conflict of laws – Natural forum – Stay of proceedings – Whether Singapore court is an appropriate forum in light of concurrent foreign proceedings"],"date":"2025-01-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 249 of 2023, (Summons No. 930 of 2022)","title":"XFS v XFT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 1","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32700-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Chiok Beng Piow (AM Legal LLC) and Ms Chuah Hui Fen Christine (D' Bi An LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mr Ivan Cheong, Mr Shaun Ho and Ms Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XFS v XFT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XFS <em>v</em> XFT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

FC/SUM 930/2023 (“SUM 930”), was filed by the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) in March 2023 seeking a stay of the divorce proceedings in FC/D 249/2023 (“D 249”) which were commenced by the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To better appreciate the context surrounding the present application and the implications of the orders sought in SUM 930, one must first consider the procedural history of D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced D 249 in January 2023. The Husband, who was served the divorce papers, filed a Memorandum of Appearance around a month later indicating his intention to contest the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband then filed SUM 930 on 22 March 2023 and sought a stay of the divorce proceedings pending the conclusion of a specific legal action in Israel (which he had commenced against the Wife) on the ground of “<em>forum non conveniens</em>”. This was followed by a Defence and Counterclaim which the Husband filed in May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In a somewhat unusual turn of events, the parties reached an agreement that they would proceed with D 249 on an uncontested basis in relation to the <em>grounds of divorce</em> (<em>ie</em>. on both the Wife’s and the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour). Both parties filed amended pleadings in September 2023 – the Wife filed her amended Statement of Claim and Statement Particulars, and the Husband filed his amended Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Interim Judgment for Divorce (“IJ”) was thus granted on 7 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Even though the IJ had been granted, it remained the Husband’s position that he would continue to pursue SUM 930. That effectively meant that the stay of proceedings he had sought in SUM 930 would relate only to the proceedings for ancillary matters (“AM”) relief in D 249 since the grounds for the parties’ divorce were already fully and finally determined in the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Following the grant of the IJ, the Husband applied for and obtained permission from the Court to formally amend SUM 930 to refer only to the AM reliefs sought in the pleadings,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as well as to include a general reference to all the legal proceedings which were pending before the Israeli courts (“Israeli Proceedings”). By that time, there were multiple lawsuits between the parties in Israel. I will address the Israeli Proceedings in greater detail later on in these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       By the time SUM 930 was heard by this Court, it transpired that much of the Israeli Proceedings have concluded, save that the Husband’s appeal against part of the Israeli Family Court’s earlier decision (“Israeli Appeal”) has not yet been heard. As such, the Husband – through his counsel – sought a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249. The effect of such a stay would be that the remainder of the divorce proceedings, <em>ie.</em> the proceedings for AM reliefs (“AM Proceedings”), would be brought to an immediate end.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 21 October 2024, I delivered my oral grounds of decision in respect of SUM 930. In summary, I dismissed the Husband’s application for a permanent stay and ordered that there be a limited case management stay of D 249 pending the conclusion of his Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Both parties have since appealed against my decision, <em>vide.</em> HCF/RAS 20/2024 and RAS 21/2024. These are my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given the procedural posture of the present proceedings, there was some initial debate between the parties’ counsel as to whether the Husband’s stay application remained grounded on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This issue arose because despite the prayers in SUM 930 referring to phrase “<em>forum non conveniens</em>”, much of the Husband’s counsel’s arguments was focused on the impact and relevance of the parallel Israeli Proceedings, and the concern with multiplicity of proceedings in two jurisdictions, <em>ie.</em> Israel and Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Notwithstanding the somewhat unusual turn of events, I agreed with the Husband’s counsel that the principle of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remained a live issue between the parties, and was one of the legal bases relied upon by the Husband in support of SUM 930. This was evident from the fact that both counsel had filed detailed written submissions addressing this issue, and the principle itself was referred to in SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Moreover, the concerns as regards <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in the present case arose as a result of the Husband’s subsequent Israeli legal action against the Wife, as compared to D 249 which was the Wife’s initial divorce application in Singapore against the Husband. The situation thus fell within what the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Constructions Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1097.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Virsagi</em>”) had observed as being a “reversed parties situation”, <em>ie.</em> where a plaintiff sues a defendant in Singapore, and the same defendant then sues the plaintiff abroad (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [27]). The <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in such a situation operates <em>within</em> the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, and is to be considered under the rubric of the general principles applicable to the doctrine (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [38] and [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will therefore start by addressing the question of whether the Husband is entitled to seek a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the outset, I note that, in both parties’ written submissions, they accept that in considering the issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the Family Court would apply the principles set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> (or the “<em>Spiliada</em> test”) to determine whether a stay of divorce proceedings should be granted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I agree with the said approach as that is consistent with the prevailing caselaw: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a> and <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a>, Debbie Ong JC (as Her Honour then was) held as follows (at [14] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    It is well accepted in Singapore that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remains relevant in matrimonial proceedings, including proceedings involving the custody of children. The High Court in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> first made it clear that the <em>Spiliada</em> principles (derived from and named after the seminal case of <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”)) apply in matrimonial proceedings. Similarly, the High Court in <em>Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla (Danialle An, co-respondent)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> applied the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to divorce and related ancillary matters, citing [16] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 1 SLR(R) 0104.xml')\">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 104</a> which reads […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In gist, the <em>Spiliada</em> test is a factors-based test which starts with an assessment as to whether the applicant (in this case, the Husband) has shown that there exists another available forum which is more appropriate. If there is <em>prima facie</em> another more appropriate forum, the court will grant a stay unless there are “special circumstances” which justify refusing to grant the stay: see <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> at [21] – [24]. The latter is commonly referred to as the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     At the second stage, the burden shifts to the responding party (ie. the Wife in the present case) to show the presence of “special circumstances” by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused: see <em>AZS v AXR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0700.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 700</a> at [11]; <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a> at [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband is precluded from raising forum non conveniens</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As I had alluded to above, the present case is unique in that the parties agreed to hold SUM 930 in abeyance while allowing the IJ to be granted in relation to D 249 by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my judgment, I find the Husband’s agreement for the Singapore court to grant the IJ to be inimical to his claim that a stay should be granted on account of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)    <u>The Husband had accepted Singapore as the most appropriate forum</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To satisfy the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the Husband asserted that there exists another court (presumably, the Israeli court) which would be “more appropriate” than the Singapore court. However, such a claim cannot be sustained when he had himself accepted (and had, in fact, expressly agreed with the Wife) that the Singapore Family Court was the appropriate court to grant IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     What is of especial significance, in the present case, was that the IJ was granted on <em>both</em> the parties’ amended claim and counterclaim relating to their respective unreasonable behaviour. In other words, both the Wife and the Husband expressly invoked the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to put an end to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the Husband’s amended pleadings, his entire Defence (including his objection to the Singapore courts having jurisdiction to determine the AM Proceedings) was deleted. In the Husband’s amended Counterclaim, AM reliefs <em>from the Singapore Family Court</em> were expressly sought and for those same reliefs to be adjourned to be determined in Chambers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Husband thus recognised that the Singapore was the appropriate jurisdiction to grant AM reliefs and cannot then claim that there was a more appropriate forum elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)    <u>Whether a “partial stay” of divorce proceedings can be granted</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Does this mean that that the Husband cannot then seek a stay (or, in counsel’s submissions, a “partial” stay) of D 249 such that <em>only</em> the AM proceedings are stayed? In addressing this question, both counsel made extensive submissions on whether the concept of a partial stay was even applicable to divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Drawing from similar principles in the context of civil litigation, the Husband’s case was that the Singapore court can always grant a partial stay whenever a claimant has different claims against the same defendant. The court would then be at liberty to decide which claims ought to be stayed against the defendant (so that they could be pursued elsewhere), while allowing the other claims to proceed within the forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the present case, the Husband analogised the claims leading to the grant of the IJ (<em>viz.</em> the grounds for the divorce) as being one claim between the parties, and the AM Proceedings (for ancillary relief) being an entirely separate claim, with the latter capable of being stayed independently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While I acknowledge that a Singapore court can grant such “partial stays” in relation to commercial claims (as was recognised by the High Court in <em>Humpuss Sea Transport v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss</em>”)), the cases where the grant of such stays were discussed occurred in the context of a claimant having different civil claims (or causes of action) against the same defendant some of which could be pursued in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For example, the High Court in <em>Humpuss</em> (at [96] of the judgment) referred to a situation where part of a party’s claims arose from a specific jurisdiction’s statutory law. Where such claims are brought alongside other general claims, the statutory cause of action may sometimes be partially stayed in favour of that forum so as to discourage litigants from tacking on claims with no obvious connection to the forum to claims which do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     However, those principles (which makes sense in the context of civil litigation) do not sit well with, and <em>cannot</em> be easily analogised to, divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To begin with, the power of the Family Court to grant any form of AM relief is derived from (and consequent on) an interim judgment of divorce being granted to dissolve the parties’ marriage. In my view, one cannot exist without the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     There are no <em>separate</em> causes of action or claims within the context of divorce proceedings because a party cannot apply to the Singapore Family Court to independently divide assets or seek a maintenance order, under Chapter 4 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (“WC”), without first obtaining interim judgment from the same Singapore court. This is apparent from the statutory schema of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For example, s 112(1) of the WC (which is located within Chapter 4) gives the court the power to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets only “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Section 113(1)(b) similarly gives the court the power to order maintenance “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Indeed, s 123 (in Chapter 5 of the WC) likewise directs the court not to make final any judgment of divorce unless arrangements have been made for the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     While the present marriage does not involve children, what is clear from the overall context of the provisions in the WC is that proceedings for ancillary relief (which relate to the financial consequences of a divorce and, where applicable, child-related orders) are intimately connected with, and are <em>part of</em>, the same claim for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To put matters in perspective, prior to 2011, it was well acknowledged that there was a “gap” in Singapore’s matrimonial law because the Singapore court had no powers to grant any AM relief independently, if it was not the court which granted the judgment for the parties’ divorce (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>UFM v UFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24027-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 2 SLR 650</a> at [1]). Parliament then had to statutorily enact Chapter 4A of the WC to specifically allow former spouses who were divorced in another jurisdiction to apply to the Singapore court for financial relief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was thus not persuaded by the Husband’s argument that the AM Proceedings should be considered a separate claim or cause of action which can be “severed” from a claim for the dissolution of the parties’ marriage. They are two inter-connected parts of the same claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Accordingly, the Husband was not entitled to seek a stay (whether fully or partially) of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> given that he had submitted to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction and had accepted its appropriateness to determine the parties’ divorce. It followed therefore that, by the Husband’s actions, he had acknowledged that the Singapore court was <em>in fact</em> the appropriate court to hear and determine the AM Proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Israel is not a more appropriate forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, even if the Husband was entitled to seek an independent stay of the AM Proceedings (contrary to my decision above) and I had applied the <em>Spiliada</em> test, I would not have found Israel to be a more appropriate forum in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In my view, apart from the fact that there were (and possibly continues to be) legal proceedings in the Israeli courts which the Husband had commenced against the Wife, no other factor clearly points to Israel being the appropriate jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In this regard, I accept the Wife’s submissions that both parties registered and celebrated their marriage in Singapore, and had lived in Singapore both before and after their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They both applied for and had obtained Permanent Resident status in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife is now a Singapore citizen. They also worked in Singapore and have significant assets in Singapore, including two Singaporean companies – [SGD] Pte Ltd and [AML] Pte Ltd.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The fact that they may also have an asset overseas (in the United States of America) was, in my view, inconclusive – it certainly does not point to the Israeli court as being the “more appropriate” forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This is particularly so given that the stay sought by the Husband was only in relation to the AM reliefs to be granted by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Overall, I was satisfied that all relevant connecting factors point to Singapore as being the appropriate forum. The Husband’s request for a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> was therefore not made out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other Considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Before addressing the Husband’s other arguments, I wish to make clear that in reaching my conclusion that he was not entitled to seek a partial stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, I did not accept the Wife’s submission that because the WC was the “governing law” for marriages in Singapore,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> it meant that there were public policy considerations which would enjoin this Court to conclude that Singapore must be the most appropriate or, indeed, the only forum of choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the main, the Wife’s submission was that since the parties registered their marriage in Singapore, the “just and equitable” division of assets regime (or the legal concept of a deferred community of property) envisaged under the WC should be seen as a manifestation of public policy operating to favour Singapore as the only jurisdiction of choice when it comes to the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the context of modern-day marriages, spouses can come from different jurisdictions, geographical locations, and they can choose to register (or celebrate) their marriage in any number of countries. It does not seem logical to say that because the parties married in Singapore, <em>ipso facto</em>, Singapore’s domestic marriage laws must apply as a matter of “<em>public policy</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Family Court, in considering whether a stay of proceedings ought to be granted, will still have to weigh the relevant connecting factors pursuant to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. Where the parties had registered their marriage and the applicable marriage laws of that forum are, at best, one of several considerations and would not be dispositive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I should also add that my decision in the present case should not be taken as having expressed a definitive view that it is legally impermissible for spouses to agree to have their marriage dissolved in Singapore, but with the AM proceedings dealt with by another court, in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Parties may perhaps be entitled to come to an express agreement for such an outcome. Another possibility alluded to by the Husband’s counsel relates to the existence of legal frameworks in other jurisdictions which permit spouses to <em>first</em> apply for the division of their marital assets in that jurisdiction and then apply for divorce elsewhere, or <em>vice-versa</em>. If parties had agreed to take such a path, it might be possible that the divorce sought in Singapore relates only to the dissolution of their marriage. As these considerations were <em>not</em> present in this case, I express no firm views on these matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My decision in the SUM 930 should be limited to the particular facts of the present case – <em>ie.</em> where a party, having freely elected and consented to the Singapore Family Court granting an IJ to end his marriage and agreeing for his prayers for ancillary relief to be adjourned for determination, subsequently seeks to stay the consequent AM proceedings in favour of another jurisdiction on account of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In such a situation, I find that the party in question is not allowed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Should a Case Management Stay be granted? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Although the Husband was not, in my view, entitled to a stay of the D 249 on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, that was not the end of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Court can, in exercise of its discretion, grant a case management (or limited) stay if I were to find that there was a risk of multiplicity of proceedings if D 249 is allowed to proceed given the existence of the Israeli Proceedings. In deciding whether to do so, the Court must consider all the circumstances of the case, and determine whether there is a need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole: see <em>BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam and Ruth Agam</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 3 SLR 27</a> at [34] and [35]. For case management stays, it is not necessary for the Court to consider the principles governing <em>forum non conveniens</em>: see <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 1192.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 1192</a> at [47].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Although the Husband’s main case was that there should be a permanent stay of the D 249 (whether on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, or because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings) and not a limited case management stay, the issue of such a stay was nonetheless raised during oral submissions. It was also expressly referred to in the Wife’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As the grant of a case management stay was within this Court’s inherent powers, I find it relevant to discuss this issue in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Israeli Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering the issue of multiplicity of proceedings, I will first address the Israeli Proceedings which the Husband had relied on as a significant aspect of his case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It was common ground – both in the parties’ submissions and in their experts’ evidence – that there were two separate actions before the Israeli Family Court, <em>ie.</em> Suit No. 60180-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 1”) and Suit No. 5245-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It was also not disputed that Israeli Suit 1 dealt with the <em>financial</em> issues arising from a partnership agreement which parties had signed in March 2015 (“Partnership Agreement”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     On 24 October 2023, Judge Samuel Bar Yosef of the Israel Family Court gave his judgment in respect of Israeli Suit 1 (“1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment”). In the said Judgment, the court held that the Partnership Agreement was enforceable only in relation to the properties which the parties had “<em>accumulated until the date of marriage of the parties (January 16, 2020)</em>” and that it was “<em>not enforceable in regards</em> [sic] <em>to property that was accumulated after the marriage of the parties</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> For completeness, Judge Yosef’s decision also covered assets which were accumulated before marriage, but are connected to post-marital assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The second common ground between the parties was that part of Israeli Suit 2 was commenced to <em>enforce</em> the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment. This was what Judge Yosef had envisaged in the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli judgment when the learned judge stated in his Judgment that “<em>the implementation of the provisions of the</em> [Partnership Agreement]<em>, according to this ruling shall be conducted in a separate proceeding</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Israeli Suit 2 was thus the said “separate proceeding”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     However, it was clear from the evidence that Israeli Suit 2 covered <em>more</em> than the mere enforcement of the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment and/or the implementation of the Partnership Agreement (which provided that the Husband should be entitled to 80% of the relevant assets). The Husband had also sought additional reliefs in Israeli Suit 2 which covered the division of the parties’ <em>post-</em>marital assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The latter issue was one which the court in Israeli Suit 1 <em>did not</em> make orders for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The judgment for Israeli Suit 2 was delivered by Judge Yosef in April 2024 wherein the learned Judge granted the enforcement order sought by the Husband (arising from Israeli Suit 1) and, <em>in addition</em>, that the Husband was entitled to 50% of the assets accumulated <em>after</em> marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In dealing with the parties’ post-marital assets, Israeli Suit 2 had – in effect – determined what the Singapore court would have to decide in the AM Proceedings for D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     It follows from the matters discussed above that the relevance of the Israeli Proceedings and the parties’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> these proceedings formed a significant dispute between the parties in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In particular, the Husband focused his arguments on whether this Court should find the Wife as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts. The Husband’s case was that if this Court finds that the Wife had done so, she should then be bound by the judgments in both Israeli Suits 1 and 2, and this Court should not proceed with the AM Proceedings given that those reliefs had already been sought <em>and obtained</em> by the Husband in Israel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As regards the issue of submission to jurisdiction, I accept the Husband’s argument that the Wife did submit to the jurisdiction of the Israeli court in Israeli Suit 1. The Wife filed submissions in Israeli Suit 1 and had participated in the court hearings leading up to Judge Yosef’s judgment on 24 October 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This was not seriously disputed by the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     What was more controversial was whether the Wife had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts (whether voluntarily or otherwise) in relation to Israeli Suit 2. The Husband’s primary position was that Israeli Suit 2 was merely a “continuation” and/or “enforcement” proceeding following on from Israeli Suit 1 and that this Court should consider both Suits in the Israeli Family Court as being one and the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     While much ink was spilled in both parties’ written submissions as to the nature of the Israeli Suit 2, the fact remained (and which I accept) that Israeli Suit 2 covered matters which <em>went beyond</em> Israeli Suit 1.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Husband had sought adjudication by, and relief from, the Israeli Family Court with regard to the parties’ post-marital assets (which was a new claim in Israeli Suit 2). Separate service of legal process was carried out in respect of Israeli Suit 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the Israeli Family Court appeared to have expressed a dim view of the Wife for her decision not to participate in Israeli Suit 2 when she had already participated in Israeli Suit 1, I nevertheless accept the Wife’s foreign law expert’s opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that she did not act in a manner which could be taken as having submitted to the Israeli Family Court’s jurisdiction <em>for Israeli Suit 2</em>. She did not participate in those proceedings, nor did she file any documents or take any steps in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To address this concern, the Husband mounted a <em>secondary</em> argument, <em>ie.</em> that this Court should deem the Wife as having submitted to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction of Israeli Suit 2 under the principle of “inchoate submission” referred to in the High Court’s decision of <em>Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0545.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 545</a> (“<em>Giant Light Metal</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I accept that the principle of inchoate submission has been recognised by the local courts as being part of Singapore law. The General Division of the High Court’s recent decision in <em>Re Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd and anor matter (GAS, non-party)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32165-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 241</a> at [81] confirmed its application in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     However, I am not persuaded that the principle of inchoate submission applies in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In <em>Giant Light Metal</em>, Andrew Ang J explained the principle as follows (at [48] and [49] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    Underlying all three of these cases is the principle that the courts are willing to recognise, for the purposes of international jurisdiction, that a party’s consent to the jurisdiction of a foreign court in relation to certain claims may be imputed to further claims in some circumstances. … Such “inchoate submission” – as seen in Whyte and Aeroflot – is also possible in relation to claims which are brought pursuant to subsequent and separate proceedings in respect of the same parties, rather than just to claims which are part of the same proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">49    The question then is when consent will be imputed or “inchoate submission” be said to arise. Murthy provided two factual reference points for consent to be so imputed: where the subsequent claim concerns the same subject matter; and where the subsequent claim is related to the original claim. Which subsequent claims will fall under these categories is then a matter of degree based on the circumstances. The courts in making this assessment seemed to be informed by concerns of fairness to both the plaintiff and the defendant, and also a desire to disregard technical impediments created by procedural rules under both foreign and forum law. With respect, I agree with such an approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For the reasons I had set out at [64] above, I find that Israeli Suit 1 and Suit 2 did not concern claims for the <em>same</em> subject-matter and/or that the claim in Suit 1 was <em>related</em> to Suit 2. The “same” or “related” subject-matter I am referring to is the claim for the division of the parties’ <em>post-marital</em> assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In my view, it would not be appropriate or fair to impute the Wife’s consent to, and participation in, Israeli Suit 1 (which related to the parties’ Partnership Agreement) as being her acceptance of the Israeli court’s jurisdiction <em>vis-à-vis</em> Israeli Suit 2 when a significant part of the latter Suit related to how the parties’ matrimonial assets are to be divided. The two Suits thus involved separate subject-matter and reliefs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     On a related issue, the Israeli court had, in its judgment for Israeli Suit 2, determined that there was proper service of legal process on the Wife in accordance with Israeli procedural rules, and that it was satisfied that the Wife was aware of the proceedings in Suit 2 when it proceeded to render its judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Notwithstanding the Israeli court’s decision, the Wife’s counsel submitted that in answering the question as to whether a party had submitted to a foreign jurisdiction, the Singapore court ought to determine the same by reference to <em>Singapore’s</em> conflict of laws principles.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In other words, even if a party is deemed to have been within the foreign court’s jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of foreign civil procedure, it does not necessarily mean that there has been voluntary submission under the Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I agree with the Wife’s submissions and for the reasons I have explained above, the Wife did not voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, despite the foreign court’s own decision that it had jurisdiction over her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In view of my conclusion that the Wife did not submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, I find that the Husband’s other argument relating to transnational issue estoppel (which he had raised in his written submissions) would not be engaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In <em>The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31082-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 56</a> (“<em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em>”), the Court of Appeal re-affirmed the formulation of the legal test for transnational issue estoppel observing (at [64] – [65]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    The same test has been applied with some modifications in the context of <em>transnational</em> issue estoppel where the prior judgment is rendered in a foreign jurisdiction (<em>Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp (formerly known as Merck &amp; Co, Inc) v Merck KGaA (formerly known as E Merck)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26043-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 1102</a> (“<em>Merck Sharp</em>”) (at [2]); <em>The Sennar</em> at 500). The test for transnational issue estoppel has been formulated as follows (<em>Merck Sharp</em> at [35]–[40]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The foreign judgment must be capable of being recognised in this jurisdiction, where issue estoppel is being invoked. Under the common law, this means that the foreign judgment must:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    be a final and conclusive decision on the merits;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   not be subject to any defences to recognition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    There must be commonality of the parties to the prior proceedings and to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    The subject matter of the estoppel must be the same as what has been decided in the prior judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65    With respect to the requirement at [64(a)(ii)] above that the <b>court giving the foreign judgment must have transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</b>, this requirement has been defined in terms that <b>the forum court recognising the judgment must be satisfied that, according to its own rules of private international law</b>, <b>the foreign court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction in the “international sense”</b> to render that judgment (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss Sea Transport</em>”) at [71]; <em>The Republic of the Philippines v Maler Foundation and others and other appeals</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1389.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1389</a> (“<em>Maler Foundation</em>”) at [66]). <b>There are four possible grounds of jurisdiction: (a) presence in the foreign country; (b) filing a claim or counterclaim before the foreign court; (c) voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court by appearing in the proceedings; and (d) agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction before the commencement of proceedings</b> (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport at [71]; Sang Cheol Woo v Spackman, Charles Choi and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29049-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 298</a> (“Sang Cheol Woo”) at [57]).</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In the present case, none of the four possible grounds of jurisdiction noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em> (see above) applied such that a judgment in Israeli Suit 2 would be one which “<em>originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</em>”. The Wife had no presence in Israel, did not file any formal claim or counterclaim in Israeli Suit 2, nor did she agree and/or voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that allowing D 249 to proceed would not create multiplicity of proceedings. Insofar as Israeli Suit 2 sought to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets, that decision was made in the Wife’s absence, and she is entitled to proceed with the AM Proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I do not find there to be a need for a permanent case management stay to be granted as a result of Israeli Suit 2. To avoid doubt, nothing in my decision precludes the Husband from raising the outcome of the Israeli Suit 2 to the Singapore court hearing the AM Proceedings, or for the Wife to apply to set-aside any judgment rendered in Israeli Suit 2 (if she so wishes).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     As regards Israeli Suit 1, the subject matter of that action pertains to the parties’ <em>pre­</em>-marital assets. It is trite that the spouses’ pre-marital assets are not matrimonial assets over which the Family Court has the power to divide under s 112(1) of the WC. That being the case, the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment may well be a matter which could be raised to the court hearing the AM Proceedings in Singapore, but it was not a decision which would result in a multiplicity of proceedings, or might give rise to inconsistent judgments if the AM Proceedings continue in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevance of the Israeli Barring Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Before I leave the issue of the Israeli Proceedings, I want to briefly address an order issued by the Israeli Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On 10 February 2024, the Israeli Family Court issued what the parties referred to as a “Barring Order”. In effect, this Barring Order was akin to an anti-suit injunction prohibiting the Wife from conducting “<em>property proceedings</em>” in a jurisdiction other than in the Israeli court. Both parties accept that the Barring Order would cover D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     At the conclusion of the first tranche of the hearing of SUM 930, I directed both parties’ counsel to file further written submissions on the relevance and impact of the Barring Order <em>vis-à-vis</em> SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It was common ground in both counsel’s written submissions that while the existence of the Barring Order was something which this Court can consider in the overall analysis of the case, this Court was not bound to follow the Barring Order, save that it may give rise to a consideration of international comity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     In my view, any concerns as regards international comity in the present case may well be academic given that the Husband (in favour of whom the Barring Order was made) had taken the position – through counsel – that the proceedings in Israel were effectively over. Counsel explained that that Israeli Suit 2 had since completed with the Israeli Family Court issuing an order for the payment of monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In other words, there is now an alleged judgment debt due from the Wife arising from the Israeli court’s final determination of the “property dispute” in relation to Israeli Suit 2. How the Husband seeks to enforce that judgment against the Wife would be a separate matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Insofar as D 249 is concerned, the question before this Court is simply whether it should continue now that the Israeli Family Court had issued its decisions. In my view, this is not a matter which would impinge on, or overlap with, the Barring Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In any case, whether the Wife is liable for breaching the Barring Order (if at all) would be a matter to be addressed in the Israeli courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s appeal against the Judgment in Israeli Suit 1</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     I move on to the next (and final) issue, <em>ie.</em> what, if any, would be the impact of the Israeli Appeal filed by the Husband’ against the Judge Yosef’s decision for Israeli Suit 1?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In my judgment, the Husband’s appeal is particularly relevant given that it was the Husband’s case, in Israeli Suit 1, that the Partnership Agreement between the parties operated as a pre-nuptial agreement (“PNA”). In the Husband’s Statement of Appeal to the Israel District Court, he requested the appellate court to intervene and hold that the Partnership Agreement also applied to property accumulated after marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This meant that if the Israeli appellate court eventually decides that the Partnership Agreement (and its 80:20 division ratio in favour of the Husband) also applied to post-marital assets, such an outcome may potentially have an impact on the Singapore AM Proceedings. This is because the enforceability of a foreign PNA entered into by the parties before marriage may be a relevant fact which the AM court in Singapore may take into account when it determines what would be a just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets: see for <em>eg. TQ v TR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0961.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Put another way, the present case would be akin to a case where, in proceedings for ancillary reliefs before the Singapore court, one of the parties wishes to rely on the terms of a PNA governed by foreign law while the other party challenges the PNA’s validity. Where there are parallel proceedings in the foreign court to determine the validity and/or enforceability of the said PNA under the laws applicable to the contract, it is not uncommon for the Singapore court to temporarily stay the local proceedings to await the decision of the foreign court in order to assess whether the foreign court’s decision might impact how the assets are to be divided in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Both counsel have confirmed, via correspondence to the Court in October 2024, that the Husband’s Israeli Appeal remains pending. Given that the outcome of the appeal may have an impact on what the court hearing the AM Proceedings has to consider, I find it fair and reasonable to grant a limited case management stay of D 249 until the conclusion of the Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Over the course of various series of twists and turns in the progress of the Israeli Proceedings, the Husband’s position with respect to the present divorce proceedings have similarly meandered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     SUM 930 which was filed as an application for a stay of the entirety of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> turned into to a partial stay of the AM reliefs <em>pending</em> the conclusion the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s application to amend SUM 930), and finally to a request for a permanent stay because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s counsel’s submissions at the hearing of SUM 930).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     In the end, I ordered that there be a limited case management stay in respect of D 249 pending the conclusion of the Husband’s Israeli Appeal. This order was, in effect, similar to what the Husband had sought in his Prayer 1 of the amended FC/SUM 930/2023, <em>ie.</em> that the proceedings in FC/D 249/2023 are stayed pending the final decision of the Courts of Israel (Family court, District court, etc.) in relation to suit no. 60180-XX-XX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     However, given that the Husband was no longer seeking a temporary stay of proceedings and the entirety of the hearing of SUM 930 was focused on whether he was entitled to a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249 (which I did not agree with), I found that the Wife was, in the overall analysis, the successful party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     When I delivered my oral decision on 21 October 2024, I asked both counsel to address me on the issue of costs which the Wife would be entitled to as costs should follow the event.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel sought costs in the sum of $8,000, excluding disbursements. The latter would include the costs of the Wife’s foreign law expert, and her counsel had proposed that a separate determination be made for the quantum of such disbursements if parties were unable to reach an agreement. The Husband’s counsel disagreed with the Wife’s claim, including whether the Wife was entitled to claim disbursements and costs relating to her foreign law expert.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    Given the parties’ disagreement, I directed both parties to file further submissions on the matter, which both counsel duly did so. Having considered the same, I find that the Wife’s claim for the costs of her foreign law expert in the sum of $36,624.78 to be very high. Given the nature and complexity of the issued which the Court had to consider, the contents of the expert’s report, and the lack of any breakdown or itemization, I am unable to agree with this figure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I therefore ordered costs be paid by the Husband to the Wife in the sum of $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements).</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>By Order made in FC/SUM 561/2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff-Wife’s Submissions dd 13.05.24 (“WS1”) at [47]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amnd No. 1) re-dated 18.09.23;

After a contested divorce, the issue of the division of assets came before me for hearing. I ordered for each party to keep their respective assets and for the Husband to pay cost fixed at $2,500 for the ancillary matters hearing. The Wife appealed against the entire order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties married on 15 December 2018 in Singapore and the Interim Judgment dissolving the marriage was granted on 2 October 2023. During the course of the marriage, both parties did not work. The Wife was about 32 years of age at the time of the hearing and the Husband was about 55 years of age. The Wife is a Chinese National residing in China whilst the Husband is a Singapore Citizen residing in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Prior to the marriage, the Husband transferred sums of money to the Wife and her parents. After the marriage, as the Husband had surrendered his passport to the authorities, parties lived together in the Husband’s HDB flat whenever the Wife was in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime around 18 May 2021, the Wife discovered the Husband had acted improperly with another lady. The Husband was then incarcerated a few days later (around 20 May 2021). They had little to no contact until the Wife served the divorce papers on the Husband in 2022. In the ancillary proceedings, the Husband sought the return of the monies from the Wife and the Wife claimed a share of the Husband’s HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband’s claim is based on the monies:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     he/his brother had transferred to his Wife and her parents between 1 February 2015 to 19 May 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     withdrawn from his China account between 20 September 2015 and 31 January 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Totalling: CNY2,744,794.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       He claimed there was an agreement/understanding between the parties that the above sums were for investment purposes and he sought a recovery of 50% of the amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife resisted the Husband’s claim on the basis that the monies were gifts to her and disputed the existence of any agreement. In any event, the Wife submitted that the Husband’s claim is a civil claim and cannot be claimed as a division of matrimonial assets pursuant to a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife claimed a 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat on the basis of her indirect contributions during the marriage. The Husband resisted this claim on the basis that the HDB flat was acquired by him prior to the marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s claim for 50% of the monies with the Wife </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband clarified at the first ancillary hearing on 23 April 2024 that he sought the Wife’s repayment of 50% of the sum referred to in paragraph 5. He claimed that the monies were for investment and the Wife had purchased a property in China (which was meant to be their matrimonial home) as well as banking products from such monies. He claimed 50% repayment of the principal invested amount and claimed this was fair since he is sharing this equally with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Transactions set out in tables 7.1 and 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife conceded that the transfers set out were received/taken save for Table 7.1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SN 16: a transfer of CNY500,000 to the Wife’s mother on 20 July 2018</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SN 15: cash savings of S$60,000 withdrawn from the Wife’s UOB account on 19 May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For SN 16, the Husband’s evidence was on page 78 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit. However, page 78 contains what appears to be a screenshot of a mobile message in Mandarin save for 2 names, which did not appear to belong to the parties. The message was not translated and the Husband was clearly aware of the requirement for evidence to be translated as he was reminded of this by me during the contested divorce trial wherein some of his evidence was expunged for the lack of translation. The alleged transfer in SN 16 is therefore unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For SN 15, the Husband referred to pages 51 and 52 of his Affidavit of Assets and Means. The 2 pages contain translated messages between the Husband and Wife around 28 October 2018. Firstly, the message occurred years before the alleged timing of the transaction in SN 15 and secondly, the messages only reflected the Wife’s initial impression that she could not withdraw monies from a Singapore bank account in China. There is no supporting evidence to prove that during the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s UOB bank account contained S$60,000 which belonged to him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such amount was withdrawn by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Therefore, SN 15 is also unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the remaining amounts which the Wife admitted to, she explained they were monies given to her by the Husband, her boyfriend at that time, for financial support and as gifts. They had an ongoing relationship where she was fully supported by him financially and these monies were just given to her or instructed by him to be withdrawn by her for her own use. There were no instructions from the Husband about investments and she was free to deal with the funds as she wished as they were gifted to her. She explained she used the funds for her living expenses as well as her parents’ living expenses and also did some investments (in which she suffered losses). In any event, she submitted that these monies do not form any matrimonial asset since all transactions occurred prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Applicable law on the division of matrimonial assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Family Court has the power to divide matrimonial assets upon a divorce. The definition of matrimonial assets is defined in section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. The case of <em>USB v USA and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24645-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 57</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>USB v USA</em>”) is instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“18    Examining the above provision, it is clear that the intention of the legislature was to confine the court’s powers of division to <em>assets relating to marriage</em>. It is established law that in determining the legislative purpose of a provision, primacy must be accorded to both the text and statutory context of the legislation: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [43]. As a starting point, the title of s 112 of the Charter states that the provision deals with the “[p]ower of court to order division of matrimonial assets”, <em>ie</em>, assets relating to marriage. Further, s 112 falls under Pt X of the Charter which, on the whole, pertains to matters relating to the dissolution of <em>marriage</em>. In the Charter, Parliament made the decision to confine the court’s power to divide assets belonging to divorcing parties to those they acquired during marriage. This was a matter of social policy, and one clearly within Parliament’s purview. The court cannot and should not wade into matters of social policy where the legislature has established a clear statutory framework providing for the division of assets relating to <em>marriage</em>. <b><em>It is, thus, axiomatic that the court must disregard assets which were acquired during pre-marital cohabitation or during any non-marital relationship. The ownership of such assets would have to be determined in accordance with general property law principles.</em></b> It should further be emphasised that in determining the length of a marriage, the court ought not to take into account the period during which parties were cohabiting. Marriage confers a legal status on the parties which carries with it specified rights and obligations. For non-Muslim couples who marry in Singapore, their marriage begins when they satisfy the various statutory prescriptions which the Charter sets out for the attainment of that status. The Charter governs all aspects of civil marriage and divorce in Singapore. Thus, under our law, it is inherently self-contradictory to treat parties as “married” when they were simply cohabiting.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband’s claim is not on any of the Wife’s existing assets/investments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although he made reference to the existence of them, which shows she has hidden assets that can meet his claim<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and/or corroborates his case that there was an agreement/understanding to invest. Majority of his claim is based on transactions that occurred prior to the marriage. The exceptions are SN 15 (which is unproven) and SN 10. For SN 10, there were 3 transfers from the Husband’s brother (allegedly to return a loan to the Husband) totalling CNY 80,000.00 (S$16,000) into the Wife’s account in 2019. The Husband’s consistent case throughout the hearing was to recover investment monies based on an alleged agreement formed prior to the marriage between parties. This is not a claim that can be made pursuant to the Court’s ancillary powers in divorce proceedings. Notwithstanding the Husband’s claim that they were already planning to marry then and he treated her as his wife, it is the conferment of the legal status through a valid marriage that satisfies the relevant statutory requirements that parties can avail themselves of the marital rights and obligations set out in the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made no order, based on the Husband’s claim although he is at liberty to take up other appropriate actions for the relief he sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s claim for 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It is undisputed that the HDB flat in question is solely owned by the Husband and was fully acquired by him prior to the marriage. The Wife sought a 30% share of the HDB flat based on her indirect contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In paragraphs 15-18 of her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she confirmed she made no direct financial contributions towards the flat and listed her indirect non-financial contributions during the marriage, which I summarise to be broadly to be,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when she stayed with the Husband in Singapore for short periods of 1 to 2 months at a time between December 2018 to 2019 and then for one year period between 2020 to 2021, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     when in China, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband via WeChat calls and messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she did not initially make any claim on the Husband’s HDB flat. The claim was first made in the Wife’s second Ancillary Affidavit. There was no further evidence detailing the Wife’s contributions. Little ink was spilled in the Wife’s written submissions on this claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I first considered whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset as it was clearly acquired before the marriage. Section 112(10) provides for the inclusion of assets acquired prior to the marriage as matrimonial assets if transformed. Again, the case of <em>USB v USA</em> at paragraph 19 offers guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but which have been substantially improved during the marriage by the other spouse or by both spouses, or which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the whole asset goes into the pool but if there is no transformation then, subject to (c) below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with general principles of property law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Parties did live in the HDB flat, as their home whenever the Wife was in Singapore notwithstanding the short marriage. In the case of <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a>, ordinary use and enjoyment cannot be occasional or casual:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18    I found that the Bayshore property was ordinarily used by both parties for shelter and, therefore, a matrimonial asset. The requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the parties’ use of or stay at the property was “occasional or casual”: <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [23]. Examples of casual residence are staying in a property for no more than 21 days out of 14 years of marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [60]) or on only two occasions throughout the marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19032-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 717</a> at [15]). On the present facts, even if I had accepted the Husband’s submission, residence in the property for 15 months is sufficient to constitute ordinary use for shelter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In the current case, parties lived together in the HDB flat during the marriage for about 23 months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> based on the Wife’s own evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. This was the only residence they lived together during their marriage as the Husband could not travel. There were multiple earlier attempts by the Husband to try to obtain longer residential passes for the Wife in Singapore, which supported the probability parties intended to make Singapore their home base. There were no indications that the HDB flat was meant to be a casual or temporary residence pending further plans to move to a more permanent home. I therefore made a finding that the HDB flat is a transformed matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of a solely acquired matrimonial asset in a short childless marriage</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In the case of <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>TNK v TNK</em>”), the Court of Appeal clarified that the approach set out in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) will not apply to single income marriages. The Court of Appeal confirmed the approach for long single-income marriages albeit leaving the considerations for short Single-Income marriages open:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    In <em>long</em> Single-Income Marriages, the precedent cases show that our courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets. We are in general agreement with this approach. We pause to highlight that different considerations may attach in <em>short</em> Single-Income Marriages, although we propose to leave that issue to be dealt with in an appropriate case in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In the current case, neither party worked during the marriage. However, the Husband was clearly the sole financial provider during the marriage. I am of the view that the same principle why <em>ANJ v ANK</em> methodology should not be used for single-income marriages would similarly apply in this case to unduly favour the Husband as explained in <em>TNL v TNK</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">44    Our reconsideration of the <em>ANJ</em> approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that <em>ANJ</em> approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under <em>both</em> Steps 1 and 2 of the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Whilst for long single-income marriages, division tends towards equal division, this cannot be similarly applied to short marriages. Although decided before <em>ANJ v ANK</em> and <em>TNL v TNK</em>, the Court of Appeal held in <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/53472-M.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR 729</a> non-financial contributions in a short childless marriage will be minimal:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28    Having excluded Malvern Springs from division, we now turn to consider the division of the matrimonial home. <em>In a short and childless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions as non-financial contributions will be minimal.</em> Thus, in <em>Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Cheung Kevin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 2 SLR(R) 0172.xml')\">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 172</a>, a case where the wife left home after a year, the High Court divided the matrimonial home solely in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions. In the present case, it has been established that the direct financial contributions of the parties to the matrimonial home are in the proportions of 64:36 from the Husband and the Wife respectively. The Wife rightly did not make a claim for any non-financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the current case, I find the non-financial contributions claimed by the Wife to be minimal in view of the short marriage, especially bearing in mind the Husband’s incarceration and lack of contact since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I therefore awarded the Wife no share in the HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Neither party succeeded in their claim in the ancillary matters hearing. However, I awarded costs of $2,500 in the Wife’s favour given that hearing time was almost entirely spent on the Husband’s claim. I also took into account the fact that the Wife took up a belated application to file a further affidavit after the matter was fixed for ancillary hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.1, the first set of SN 1 to 17 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband orally submitted on 10 July 2024 that he does not plan to claim investment returns but only to get back his investment principal.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s oral submission on 16 July 2024 that paragraphs 10.2 to 10.4 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit is to prove the Wife’s accounts have money which she has hidden but his claim is 50% of what was transferred to her.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of Wife’s 3<sup>rd</sup> AM Hearing Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>There was an error in the timeframe in my brief reasons but nothing turns on this error.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 17 of the Wife’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Ancillary powers of court – Parties seeking to vary order on division of matrimonial home – How power to vary is to be exercised – Section 112(4) Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2024-12-23","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4937 of 2021, Summons No. 3012 of 2024;

They have a son together (D.O.B.: May 2013). In August 2023, orders on ancillary matters (“<b>Order</b>”) were made following the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Clause 3 of the Order deals with the matrimonial home. It states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The matrimonial property at XXX shall be divided in the proportion of 54% to the Plaintiff and 46% to the Defendant, based on joint valuation in the event of a transfer. <em>In the event of a transfer</em>, the transferee will bear the costs and expenses of the transfer. <em>In the event of a sale</em>, parties will bear the costs and expenses of sale equally. Parties are to refund their CPF monies utilised towards the purchase of the matrimonial property with accrued interest from their own share of the matrimonial property. <em>Parties will work out the payment terms within 4 weeks. Failing which, parties are to apply for further orders</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is common ground that based on Clause 3, the Plaintiff is to receive <b>$475,200</b> as his share in the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ positions and interests</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties are however unable to agree on how the Plaintiff is to receive the relevant funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff wants to receive the funds by <em>selling</em> the home in the open market. According to him, he needs his share of the sale proceeds to move on with his life and to purchase his own place.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, the Defendant wants to <em>take over</em> the matrimonial home – to ensure continuity in the son’s current living arrangements. In the Defendant’s view, such a continuity is important because the son is sitting for his PSLE in 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Proposed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given their disagreement on how the matrimonial home ought to be dealt with, the parties applied to vary the Order. The details of their proposed variations are in <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. In summary –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff proposes that Clause 3 be varied such that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The matrimonial home is to be sold in the open market within six months,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Both parties are to have joint conduct of the sale, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Each party is to retain the balance of the sale proceeds in the ratio of 54% (Plaintiff) and 46% (Defendant) after the relevant payments and refunds have been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Defendant proposes that Clause 3 and Clause 2 (on child maintenance) be varied such that she takes over the matrimonial home after making the following payments (totalling $475,200) to the Plaintiff:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $220,000 (cash) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $153,900 (from lump sum child maintenance payable by the Plaintiff)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $101,300 (transfer from the Defendant’s CPF Special Account to the Plaintiff’s CPF Special Account).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before I address the proposed variations, it is useful to first summarise the applicable principles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">When is power available</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets is provided in s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). This power is available only if the order has <em>not</em> been completely implemented. Put in another way, if everything that is required to be done under the order has been carried out and the assets concerned has already been distributed, then the court will not have the power under s 112(4) to revisit or reopen the order: <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<b><em>AYM</em></b>”) at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the present case, it is not disputed that the power to vary the Clause 3 is available as the provision has not been implemented yet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether power should be exercised </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The next question is whether I ought to vary Clause 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the need for finality, courts will exercise the power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets only in limited situations: <em>AYM</em> at [22]. Two well established situations where courts will exercise the power are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where the order is <em>unworkable to begin with</em>. This unworkability can be due to (i) a lack of functionality of the order, or (ii) a fundamental misunderstanding at the time the order was made: <em>AYM</em> at [29].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the order has <em>become unworkable</em> because of <em>new circumstances</em> which either (i) make the order impossible to implement practically, or (ii) so radically changes the situation so that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended: <em>AYM</em> at [25] to [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I should add that the Court of Appeal has left open the issue of whether an application under s 112(4) will also be entertained in the following situations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where there has been fraud in an order for the division of matrimonial assets: <em>AYM</em> at [30].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the division is made by a consent order and there has been an absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties: <em>AYM</em> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where there has been fraudulent misrepresentation made by one of the parties before the divorce: <em>AYM</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, the present case falls within [10(b)] above. I say this because Clause 3 <em>could have been implemented</em> if the parties are able to agree on how the matrimonial home is to be dealt with. However, as it turns out, such an agreement is not possible. (Clause 3 did not provide for this contingency – e.g., by directing that the matrimonial home be sold in the open market if the parties fail to reach an agreement on its transfer to the Defendant after a specified period.) As a result of the disagreement, Clause 3 is impossible to implement. In the circumstances, I agree with the parties that I ought to vary Clause 3 to resolve the parties’ impasse regarding the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">How should power be exercised</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     This brings me to the next issue – how should Clause 3 be varied? In this case, the parties have presented me with competing proposals for variation. How should I decide?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In the context of the present case (which involves a variation under [10(b)] above), I find the following considerations to be relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Starting point</em>. It is well settled that when a court exercises its power under s 122(4), it will not re-open the original order. Neither will the court allow the parties to re-litigate the order: <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a> (“<b><em>UMM</em></b>”) at [15]. The starting point is that the original order is just and equitable, and that the variation must be done in a way that preserves its integrity and finality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In line with the above, a court needs to consider the following when varying an order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>Whether the variation is surgical</em>. The variation should be surgical – i.e., (1) it should be done with a light touch, and (2) it should be limited to do only what is necessary to make the original order workable: <em>TYA v TYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21710-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 1170</a> at [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Whether the variation reflects intent of original order</em>. It is necessary to consider (1) what is the intent behind the original order (<em>AYM</em> at [25]) and (2) whether the variation is consistent with this intent. The variation should not have the effect of altering the purpose and effect of the original order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Whether the variation preserves parties’ rights and obligations</em>. The variation should also avoid prejudice to the parties – whether in (1) diminishing/removing their rights under the original order, (2) imposing new obligation(s), or (3) making existing obligation(s) more onerous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Whether the variation achieves the best outcome</em>. When presented with more than one option to vary an order, a court should logically choose the option that has the most upsides and the least downsides. The variation should ultimately achieve a just or equitable outcome: <em>Seet Poh v Lim Lee Cheng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0208.xml')\">[2014] 3 SLR 208</a> at [35]. To be clear, this does not mean that a court has the license to re-write the original order on how the matrimonial assets are to be divided: see [14(a)] above. Rather, the aim is simply to avoid a situation where the variation (inadvertently) results in unfairness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Having set out the applicable principles, I will not apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Agreed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As a preliminary point – I note that the Defendant consents to some of the variations proposed by the Plaintiff. These are in the white boxes at <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. In my view, these variations (a) are in line with the intent of Clause 3, (b) do not impinge on the finality of the Order, and (c) are reasonable. Accordingly, I allow these variations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Disputed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I now turn to the proposed variations that are disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Between the two, I prefer the Plaintiff’s proposed variations over the Defendant’s proposed variations. This is because I find that the Plaintiff’s proposed variations (a) are surgical, (b) better reflects the Order’s original intent, (c) better preserves the parties’ rights and obligations under the Order, and (d) achieves a better outcome. For my detailed reasons, see <b><u>Annex B</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     At this stage, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff “bears the burden of proof if he wishes to vary the order to that of a sale order instead of a transfer order”. According to her, this is because “the original order provided for a transfer as there was reference to payment terms”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This submission is plainly unmeritorious. <em>First</em>, Clause 3 contemplates the possibility of both a <em>sale</em> and a transfer of the home – and not just a transfer. <em>Second</em>, given that the Defendant is seeking to transfer the home to herself, she must prove why this is appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This conveniently leads me to my next point. A central theme of the Defendant’s submission is that a sale of the matrimonial home will disrupt the son’s living arrangements and PSLE preparations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In my view, the impact of the potential disruption is overstated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, I find that the potential impact to the son’s PSLE preparations from the sale of the matrimonial home is likely to be minor. I have explained why in <b><u>Annex B</u></b> at (4)(A)(ii).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, it bears highlighting that the potential disruption to the son can in fact be minimised <em>by the Defendant herself</em> – by selling her Parc Riviera property. The Defendant however is not prepared to do so because she did not want to incur “hefty financial costs” from its sale.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Defendant should get her priorities clear – if she is really concerned for her son’s welfare, then she should make the necessary financial sacrifice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, the Defendant’s proposed variations entail her obtaining a $220,000 bank loan and maintaining the son solely on her own salary. There is a risk that she might end up becoming financially stretched as a result, be unable to adequately provide maintenance for the son, and thus jeopardise his welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I come to my last point. The Defendant’s proposal requires Clause 2 (on child maintenance) to be varied. In my view, the Defendant’s underlying motives for the variation is unprincipled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, to vary an order on child maintenance, the Defendant must prove that there has been a “material change in the circumstances” of either the son or his parents: s 72 and s 127(2) of the Charter; <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> at [16]; <em>UGK v UGL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20919-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 121</a> at [15]. According to the Defendant, this requirement is met because –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">if the Father’s application is allowed, there will be such a material change in circumstances as the child will be forced to seek alternative accommodation (and there will be a different set of expenses such as rental etc). In the circumstances, we submit that the Mother has crossed the threshold given that the Father was the party who has filed for such orders.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>I find the Defendant’s submission to be disingenuous. Based on her own case, the variation is to <em>prevent</em> a change in the son’s living arrangement (so that the child can continue to stay in the matrimonial home) – and <em>not in response</em> to such a change (e.g., to cover rental costs).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, one of the Defendant’s motives for the variation is to finance <em>her</em> takeover of the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> – and not because, e.g., there has been an increase in the <em>son’s</em> monthly expenses. The Defendant clearly has no intention of using the lump sum maintenance that she is seeking to pay <em>for the son’s daily living expenses</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, the Defendant’s other motive for seeking a lump sum maintenance is to facilitate a clean break between the Plaintiff and the son. This is contrary to the well settled legal position that such a clean break (between a parent and a child) is rarely desirable and courts are slow to order a lump sum maintenance for this reason: <em>VSL v VSM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 33</a> at [30]. The Defendant has failed to provide any compelling reason why it is necessary, and in the son’s interest, for him to have a clean break from the Plaintiff. For clarity, I wish to state that the mere fact that the Plaintiff had allegedly failed to exercise his access rights or take care of the son during his access periods<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> is not a good reason for a clean break.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Finally</em>, there is nothing to stop the Defendant from seeking further child maintenance from the Plaintiff in future – given that the latter has a continuing duty to maintain his child: s 68, s 69(2) and s 73 of the Charter; <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> at [16]. Such a prospect is very likely given that the son is only 11 years old, and his expenses will certainly increase in the coming years. When the son’s financial needs increases beyond her means, there is nothing to compel the Defendant to sell the Parc Riveira property – despite her assurances to do so (as these are non-legally binding).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the above, my decision is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the Plaintiff’s application in Summons No. 3012 of 2024 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Prayers 1(a) to 1(c) are granted. For the avoidance of doubt, I accept the Defendant’s submissions and find that the “outstanding loan” referred to in Prayer 1(b) should be determined as <em>at the date of the Order</em>, and <em>not</em> the date of the transfer of the Parc Riviera property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Prayer 2 is dismissed – I agree with the Defendant that a penal notice is unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Prayer 4 is granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I dismiss the Defendant’s application in Summons No. 3316 of 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Before concluding, I wish to highlight one learning point from this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the AM proceedings, the Plaintiff had left it to the district judge to make a just and equitable division of the matrimonial home,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> while the Defendant had wanted the Plaintiff to transfer his interests in the home to her for no consideration.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Clause 3 is open-ended – the parties are left to decide whether the matrimonial home should be sold on the open market or transferred to one of them. It does not address the situation where the parties <em>cannot</em> agree on how the home should be dealt with – which is exactly what had occurred in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The failure to address the above situation could have been avoided. After all, the ancillary matters were hotly contested, and it is foreseeable that the parties will not agree on whether the matrimonial home should be sold or transferred. Even if it was felt appropriate for the Defendant to be given the first option to purchase the Plaintiff’s share in the home, there should have been a deadline imposed for the exercise of such an option. For an example of this, see clauses 1 and 2 of the consent order in <em>VPB v VPC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 15</a> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In my view, (a) the delay in dealing with the matrimonial home, (b) the applications before me, and (c) the financial and emotional costs in litigating the applications, could have been avoided <em>if all parties concerned</em> had carefully thought through the issues and had taken a clearer and firmer position on how the matrimonial home is to be dealt with. This is of course said with the benefit of hindsight. It would do well for parties and counsel to take note of the learning point raised in these applications in future cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given my views in [21] and [22] above, the Defendant is not solely responsible for the events that had led to the applications before me. Contrary to the Plaintiff submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the evidence does not prove unequivocally that the Defendant had conducted the proceedings in an unreasonable manner. In the circumstances, it inappropriate to order costs against her. Accordingly, I order that the parties are to bear their own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>__________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>ANNEX A</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>PROPOSED VARIATIONS</b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Note.

It is worth noting, however, that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father overseas and overnight access to C during the gazetted school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Parties met sometime in February 2016 and were married two years later in Singapore on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2018. They have only one child to the marriage, C born on xx June 2020. At the time of the hearings, C had just turned 4 years of age. After marriage, parties lived together with the Father’s parents and sister at the Father’s family home (“the family home”). It is not disputed that the Father comes from a traditional, Chinese patriarchal family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Sometime in 2016, parties sought the approval of the Father’s father (“the Grandfather”) to marry prior to the demise of the Mother’s mother, who was terminally ill. Their request was rejected by the Grandfather. According to the Mother, the Grandfather was often critical of the Mother, her family and their finances. To exacerbate matters, the Mother and the Father’s family had differing family values and practices, especially in relation to the upbringing of C, which resulted in increased tension within the family home. The Father inevitably found himself caught between both sides of the family overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 6 April 2021, a dispute arose between the Mother and the Grandfather during dinner, when the Grandfather told the Mother to shave C’s hair. C was about 9 months old at the time. According to the Father, prior to the incident, the Grandfather had on numerous occasions advised parties to shave C’s hair, in keeping with Chinese tradition, but the advice went unheeded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     When the Mother refused, an argument broke out at the dining table and the Grandfather threw a spoon on the table in the direction of the Mother. The Grandfather also threatened to cut C’s hair himself if the Mother did not do so. Following the incident, as she was afraid that the Grandfather would carry through with his threat, the Mother urged the Father to move out of the family home. They eventually moved out a few days later to stay with the Mother’s father at his flat, together with C. However, about two weeks after moving into the flat, the Father returned to his family home to live. According to the Father, the Mother’s father had express unhappiness with the Father for failing to provide for the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the Father returned to his family home to live, it is not disputed that he continued to visit the Mother and C on a daily basis, from about 8.00 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. to help take care of C and perform his duties before C fell asleep. He would bring with him necessities, groceries and food for the Mother and C. On Saturdays, parties would bring C over to the family home to visit the Father’s family and on Sundays, the Father would go over to spend time with C in the morning until her naptime after lunch. During her naptime, he would return home until the Mother called to inform him that C was awake. Parties would then bring C out together to visit attractions, playgrounds, parks or the library until after dinner. This arrangement lasted until 7 January 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 7 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 7 January 2022, during the Father’s visit, the Mother found the Father locked in the common toilet together with C at the flat. The Mother knocked on the toilet door repeatedly until the Father opened the door. To her horror, the Mother saw that C’s fringe had been snipped by the Father who was holding onto a pair of kitchen scissors. According to the Father, prior to 7 January 2022, the Father had noticed that the C’s fringe was getting longer to the point of irritating her eyes. He advised the Mother to trim C’s fringe, but nothing was done. As such, he decided to give C a quick trim. Shaken by the incident, the Mother called her father for assistance and the Father was asked to leave the flat by the latter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 11 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After the incident, there was no communication between parties until 11 January 2022. As the Father had not seen C since the incident, he requested to visit the child around 7.30 p.m. and was informed by the Mother to visit the child after 8.30 p.m. Unknown to the Mother, the Father’s family accompanied him on this particular visit as the Father had decided on separating from or divorcing the mother, and they wanted to discuss with the Mother and her father care and access issues relating to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     During the discussion, the Grandfather proposed for each party to have the child live with them for 3.5 days a week. It is not disputed that this discussion took place largely between the Grandfather and the Mother’s father for about an hour, with little or no input from the parties themselves during the discussion. When asked whether she agreed to the proposed arrangement, the Mother refused. Dissatisfied with the Mother’s response, the Grandfather told the Mother that he would call the police (which he promptly did) since the Father is entitled to 50% of the week with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On 14 January 2022, the Father sent messages to the Mother requesting to bring the child out to the parks and the zoo alone. The Mother replied stating that she was not agreeable to the Father taking C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 16 January 2022, the Mother sent a message asking the Father to see a counsellor together with her. She also informed the Father that he could visit the child as usual at her father's flat but he could not bring C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On 17 January 2022, while at work, the Father learnt from his parents that the Mother had applied for a personal protection order against the Father, his parents and his sister and they had just been served with the Summons for the application. This led to the Father doubting the Mother’s intentions to co-parent C equally with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Propelled by the above incidents, the Father filed the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applications for Personal Protection Orders (“PPOs”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother instituted applications for PPOs for herself and for C against the Father and the Father’s family, the details of which is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS x2/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s sister on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS x3/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s mother (“the Grandmother”) on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS x4/2022 filed by the Mother against the Grandfather on 14 January 2022. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 20 April 2023. There was no appeal against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     SS x5/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 8 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Visitation and Counselling at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     After the commencement of this Originating Summons, at a case conference on 16 February 2022, parties agreed for the Father to have supervised access to C at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency (“DSSA”) for 2 hours weekly. This was without prejudice to parties’ position taken in the main application. Parties were also referred for mediation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The supervised visitation sessions carried on for about 8 sessions between March to May 2022 (“1<sup>st</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending (i) that parties attend co-parenting counselling and (ii) subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents and the Father, counselling for the paternal grandparents to negotiate and manage their boundaries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     From the court’s perspective, given the disruptive nature of the relationship between parties and the extended family at the time, the recommendations were aimed at equipping parties and the paternal grandparents with the necessary tools required to support and enable parties to co-parent effectively for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As parties were unable to reach an agreement at mediation, at the case conferences on 30 May 2022 and 16 November 2022, parties agreed for supervised access to continue at the DSSA. The aim was to facilitate the Father’s continued access to C, pending the outcome of the Mother’s PPO application against the Father. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between August to December 2022 (“2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a further 8 sessions between January to June 2023 (“3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I also ordered parties to attend counselling to work on their co-parenting skills and, subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents, for the paternal grandparents to attend counselling, as recommended in the report. In view of the nature of the relationship between the Father and the paternal grandparents, and how the Father would often defer to the opinion of the paternal grandparents, particularly the Grandfather, I found it necessary for the paternal grandparents to learn the importance of holding boundaries in order to assist and support the Father and Mother in their efforts to co-parent C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     A report from the DSSA was again furnished to court after each tranche of supervised visitation orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     After the 2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending for a 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered. This was to enable the Father and C to continue bonding and for the Father to receive parenting modelling and intervention during the supervised visitation sessions at the DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The report further recommended that the paternal grandparents be included in the supervised visitation sessions so as to (i) provide the paternal grandparents with information on grandparenting and (ii) support the family in defining boundaries through modelling and psycho-education during the supervised visitation sessions, such as not undermining the Father's parental role. Simultaneously, the Father was recommended to attend the “Triple P Programme” to gain parental skills and confidence in bonding with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Orders were made in accordance with the recommendations and a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA thereafter, recommending for a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered and for counselling to continue for the parties and the paternal grandparents to explore the possibility of re-communication between parties and their extended families on child related matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It was noted from the report that the paternal grandparents were present for 4 out of the 8 supervised visitation sessions for the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche, and only during the second half of each session. It was further noted that following the counselling sessions and interventions received during the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, the Father was better able to maintain his parental role and exhibited firmness on what he wanted to do with the child for each session, notwithstanding the Grandfather's differing opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Parties voluntarily agreed to a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation being ordered, with the cost of the supervised visitation being borne by the Father solely. It is worth noting that the Mother was amenable to the participation of the paternal grandparents in the second half of all 8 sessions. At the case conference on 10 April 2023, orders were made accordingly with the consent of the parties. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between June to September 2023 (“4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Apart from supervised visitation orders at the DSSA, the Father also filed interim applications for access to the child outside of DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Chinese New Year Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 4 January 2023, the father filed an application in FC/SUM x4/2023 for the following orders, <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For access to C on Chinese New Year Eve and the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m., together with the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For additional weekly supervised access to C, outside of DSSA, every Wednesday from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For one-way supervised exchange to take place at noon every Saturday at DSSA, so that the Father may have supervised access to C outside of DSSA. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given the short time frame between the Father’s application and the Chinese New Year period, I heard parties on the application for supervised access during Chinese New Year first. On 13 January 2023, after hearing parties, I gave orders for the Father to have supervised access to C on Chinese New Year Eve at the DSSA from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. I also allowed the paternal grandparents to be present during the access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the Chinese New Year, the following orders were made with the consent of parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Father shall be granted access to C on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 am to 1.00 pm at Hillion Mall located at 17 Petir Road, Singapore 678278 (“Hillion Mall&quot;) as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Defendant shall handover the Child to the Plaintiff outside the premises of McDonald's located at level B1 of Hillion Mall;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The access shall take place in accordance to the Schedule of Itinerary appended to the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       In the event of any unforeseen changes to the itinerary proposed in the Schedule of Itinerary hereinabove, the Plaintiff shall keep the Defendant informed of any changes to the itinerary before proceeding to the venue of access in accordance with the amended itinerary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father's parents may be present at all times during the Plaintiff's access to the Child as stated above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is at liberty to observe the Father's access on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from a distance as long as the Mother's presence does not interfere with the Father's interactions with C during the said access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the end of the Father’s access, the Father shall hand over C to the Mother outside the premises of McDonald's.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The orders made above are without prejudice to any application by the Mother for the Father to have supervised access to C at the hearing of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_f\"></a>(f)     All other prayers in this Summons to be adjourned for further hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was no appeal filed against the Orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for additional weekly access and appointment of parent coordinator</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As mentioned earlier, FC/SUM x4/2023 was filed on 4 January 2023. After making the relevant orders in relation to Chinese New Year access, the remaining prayers were adjourned to be heard at a later date. This was to give the Mother time to file her affidavit in reply to the rest of the orders sought by the Father and for parties to file their submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As C was only three years of age at the time of the Father’s application, I indicated to parties that the appointment of a child representative may not be suitable, given her young and tender age. There was a real concern as to whether C was of the developmental age to be able to express her wishes to a child representative effectively in relation to the care and access arrangements sought by parties. The Court further queried if the appointment of a parent coordinator would be more appropriate in the circumstances to facilitate parties in their co-parenting efforts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In view of the Court’s indications above, the Father subsequently amended his application for the appointment of a parent coordinator to assist in the access arrangements with C. I noted that the main intention of the Father was to have a neutral party (i.e. someone other than the Mother or a person from the Father’s household) to supervise the interim access to C. This was because of the Mother’s insistence on supervised interim access pending the hearing of the main application and the submission of the Custody Evaluation Report (see paragraph 45 below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The main purpose of a parent coordinator is to assist parties in their co-parenting arrangements and to help parties communicate better and grow in their co-parenting skills. The hope at the end of the day is enable parties to function effectively, without the need of a parent coordinator, in their roles as co-parents. Given the tensions between parties in the present case, it was clear that if the Father was to have access to C outside of DSSA, parties would benefit from the appointment of a parent coordinator. It is unusual however for a parent coordinator to supervise access. Nevertheless, I note in the present case that the Father had obtained the consents of the proposed parent coordinators, Mr T and Ms X, both experienced and established family lawyers, to assist in the supervision of interim access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On 23 September 2023, the Father and the Mother attended the hearing together with their counsel. After hearing parties and taking note in particular of the Mother’s financial constraints and parties’ submissions in relation to the apportionment of the fees payable to the parenting coordinator, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Mr T is appointed parenting coordinator in this matter (the “Parenting Coordinator”) for an initial duration of 4 months from the date of this order, which may be extended by further order or agreement between the Father, the Mother and the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Parenting Coordinator shall accept or decline the appointment by filling up and returning to the Court the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance”. In the event that the Parenting Coordinator does not submit the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance” within 3 days of the Court notifying the Parenting Coordinator of the order, the Parenting Coordinator is deemed to have declined the appointment. Ms X or another parenting co-ordinator will be appointed in place of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Parties shall pay their share of the parenting coordination fees directly to the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Court allocates payment of fees for parenting coordination as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father will bear 100% cost of the first 1-hour joint session and 80% of any joint session thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Mother will bear 20% of the joint sessions thereafter, with the Father bearing 80%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Any solo sessions with the parent coordinator is to be borne by the parties respectively and the parties are at liberty to decline such solo sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The parties must, as far as practicable, provide to the parenting coordinator copies of all pleadings, documents and/or orders as may be requested by the parenting coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parenting coordinator may meet with the parties and/or C together or separately, in person or by any electronic means for a total number of 16 hours including the 1<sup>st</sup> joint 1 hour session held by the parenting coordinator, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Parties agree that they shall not hold the parenting coordinator liable for any damage or loss that they may incur in the course of or arising from the parenting coordination process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     With regard to the Father’s application for additional weekly access, the following orders were also made at the hearing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In addition to the supervised access at the DSSA, the Father shall be granted interim access to the Child in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator on alternate Wednesdays from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. at any one of the following locations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Bukit Timah Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bukit Panjang Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       West Mall Public Park</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Hillion Mall</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, parties agree that the interim access shall take place at all times in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father and, subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, the Parenting Coordinator shall pick up C from C’s childcare centre and return C thereafter to the Mother's residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father's parents, sister and helpers are not to be present during the interim supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Parties are at liberty to change the terms of access by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In making the above orders, I took into consideration the fact that there were times when access at the DSSA had to be rescheduled as C and the Mother were unavailable (e.g. due to illness). This resulted in the Father having irregular access to C. As such, I granted the Father an additional supervised weekly access day to C outside of the DSSA. Parties did not appeal against the orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Custody Evaluation Report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     On 31 March 2023, the Father filed FC/SUM xxx1/2023 for an order that a Custody Evaluation Report be submitted to address the suitability of parties being granted shared custody and shared care and control of C, or alternatively, that the Father has unsupervised and overnight access to C. I heard the application on 19 June 2023 and granted the orders sought. The Mother did not appeal against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Custody Evaluation Report was subsequently submitted to the Court on 4 October 2023, recommending that joint custody and shared care and control of C be granted to parties. In particular, that the Father be granted unsupervised overnight access from Mondays 17:00 hours to Thursdays 09:00 hours every alternate weeks, and from Thursdays 17:00 to Monday 09:00 hours every other week. It further recommended, <em>inter alia</em>, that both parties be at liberty to take C overseas for recreational purposes from age 5 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Parties were promptly informed briefly of the findings and recommendations of the Custody Evaluation Report at the next case conference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Exchange at DSSA</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Pursuant to the 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA recommending, <em>inter alia</em>, for the Father to have supervised exchange to C, subject to the following conditions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First two supervised exchange sessions between the Father and C to take place for 3 hours. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The subsequent six sessions between the Father and the child to take place for up to 4 hours, with liberty for the paternal grandparents to be present. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the supervised exchange sessions, the Father is to spend time with C at either his house, a mall, a library, a playground or a mutually agreeable venue near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Photographs and videos during the supervised exchange time to be taken by the Father and sent via the WhatsApp GroupChat (set up between parties and the caseworker/counsellor) to keep the Mother updated and to ensure C's safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     If there were signs of physical exhaustion in Child, Father is to inform Mother to pick up Child earlier than 3-4 hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     If the first three supervised exchange sessions were successful, the next five sessions can be done without the Mother having to bring Child to the DSSA for drop-off. Father and Mother can exchange the Child near their houses and inform the caseworker/ counsellor via WhatsApp GroupChat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although parties were largely agreeable with the recommendations made by the DSSA, the Mother objected to the Father bringing C back to his home during access as she was still concerned about the paternal grandparents influence on the Father and C, particularly the Grandfather, given her past experience and interactions with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On 7 November 2023, after hearing counsels’ submissions on behalf of parties and considering the recommendations of the DSSA reports, the following orders were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties to attend 8 sessions of supervised exchange, to take place at the DSSA as in accordance with the recommendations stated in the report, subject to the following variation to the recommendations: that at least the first three sessions of supervised exchange and access is to take place with the father and child alone for 3 hours. With regard to the venue for access, the counsellor is to work this out with the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother to attend Family Transition-Positive Parentings Programme (FT-Trip P). Parties to attend any other therapy or counselling session or programme as recommended by the caseworker/counsellor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father shall have access to the child on Christmas Day from 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. with liberty to the paternal grandparents to join the access session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Given that this was the 5<sup>th</sup> tranche of orders to be made, costs were payable by parties. The Grandfather volunteered to bear the costs for the supervised exchange sessions. As parties had no objections to the same, orders were made accordingly with the Grandfather’s consent. The supervised exchange sessions took place from December 2023 to April 2024. A further order for another 8 sessions of supervised exchange was subsequently made with the consent of parties on 11 April 2024. The 8 sessions took place from May to July 2024, which overlapped with the hearings of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot; Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is clear that the overriding and paramount principle is the welfare of the child. In <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> [1991] SLR 93, the Court of Appeal made the following observations in relation to the ‘welfare principle’ when custody is fought for:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children… We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    the conduct of the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   a young child would be best look after by its mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   which party can offer better security and stability; and,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflicts.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering whether shared care and control would be in the child's welfare, it was held in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a>, that the court has to consider factors such as that particular child's needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement and whether it is easy for the child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week. The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Supervised Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     With regard to whether a parent's access to a child ought to be supervised, it was held in <em>APE v APF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the noncustodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the noncustodial parent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the noncustodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child).&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Court in the above case went further to state at [33] that even if the child should view the non-custodial parent in a fearful or negative light, the Courts should nevertheless seek to repair the parent-child relationship where the circumstances permit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     With regard to whether there are serious welfare concerns in relation to the non-custodial parent, it was noted by the Court in <em>BKJ v BKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [23]-[25] that there must be a reasonable basis for the allegations of abuse or danger, and a mere unsubstantiated fear or suspicion is insufficient to justify supervised access. In that case, the Court found that while the Defendant Mother did not think much of the Plaintiff Father’s parenting skills, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s parenting skills were so very bad that the child would be in danger of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applying the Law to the Facts of the Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As parties agreed on joint custody, the issue in relation to care and control was whether the Court should grant sole care and control of C to the Mother, or shared care and control to parties in the present case. Although no appeal is made against my decision for sole care and control to be granted to the Mother, for totality I briefly set out my reasons why I did not grant shared care and control in the present case despite the recommendations of the custody evaluation report set out at paragraph 45 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Applying the law as set out in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> to the facts, I found that C was still of a tender young age. At the time of the hearing, she had turned 4 years of age only recently, on 13 June 2024. It is not disputed that the Mother has been the primary caregiver of C since birth. Uprooting a young child, like C, every 3-4 days to live in two different households would be overly disruptive for her development since young children require a familiar and secure environment to grow in and seek refuge in when confronted with the challenges of growing up. To exacerbate matters, given the differences between parties in their values and approaches to parenting, if shared care and control is ordered, a sense of dislocation may result where C is torn between two households where there are competing primary caregivers and approaches to her upbringing. (<em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a> at paragraphs [17] to [19].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Regarding the Father's concern about sending the wrong signal to the Mother if shared care and control was not granted, I did not agree with the Father’s submissions that the effect of not granting such an order would be the Court acceding and condoning the Defendant's alleged selfish acts of wilful assertion of her authority over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As highlighted in <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20688-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 213</a> at [75], the court would not give much weight to any potential signalling effect of a shared care and control order. Any signalling effect is dealt with by the custody order. In this case, the granting of joint custody will signal the important role that both parents play as persons with parental authority in making decisions in relation to the child. On the other hand, care and control orders are mainly concerned with the practicalities of day-to-day care of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In relation to the issue of access, I note that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father unsupervised access. It was clear from the evidence provided before the Court and the various reports submitted, that there were no issues of serious welfare concerns regarding the Father, such as violence or inappropriate parenting if C was left unsupervised in his care. I note furthermore that the relationship between C and the Father was not estranged, such that it needed reparation and supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother’s main contention pertains to specific orders relating to weekly overnight access and public holiday access (excluding access during Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year) as per the orders made on 23 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ submissions on overnight and public holiday access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     At the hearing on 17 July 2024, the Mother objected to the Father’s application for overnight access as C was still of a young age - she had just turned 4 years old. C has also been sleeping with the Mother since birth and latches to the Mother at night before she sleeps. Further, whenever C wakes up in the middle of the night, she is soothed back to sleep by the Mother. Thus, it would be traumatic for C to spend the night alone with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father on the other hand submitted that notwithstanding the above, he believed that C, who attends childcare, would be able to adjust easily to spending overnight access with him at his family home. He noted that C displayed no signs of upset or distress during the supervised exchange sessions that took place at his family home. Evidence was also provided by the Father to show that he had taken steps to make the family home suitable for overnight access to take place, such as by preparing a room for C, complete with a child’s bed, toys and a toddler-sized table with chairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In relation to Public Holiday access, I note from the Mother’s affidavits filed and both written and oral submissions made to the Court that, apart from the major public holidays like Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, no specific orders in relation to Public Holiday access were sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Father sought for Public Holiday access to be specified so as to avoid conflict between parties in terms of the access arrangements. Excluding Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, the Father specifically sought for access to be granted to him on the following Public Holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     National Day;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Good Friday;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Deepavali and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Vesak Day</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Court’s Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I commend the Mother and Father for their efforts in encouraging C to build and maintain her relationship with both parents. I noted from the reports that C is a happy child who is comfortable spending time with the Mother, Father and her extended family. There are no signs of triangulation of the child between parties, notwithstanding the breakdown in the relationship of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In view of the above, although I did not grant the Father shared care and control of the child, I allowed him overnight access to C upon C turning 5 years of age. I noted from the evidence and the reports that the Father was able to care for and bond with C independently in the absence of the Mother. I noted further from the case authorities provided by parties that overnight access was usually granted upon the child turning 5 years of age. There was no reason in the present case not to grant the Father overnight access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I was not persuaded by the Mother’s submission that overnight access would disrupt C’s breastfeeding routine or that such an order would be traumatic to C. Since the order for overnight access was to begin only upon C reaching the age of five, I did not find the order for overnight access to be disruptive to C’s current breastfeeding routine. Time was factored in for the Mother to assist in the adjustment of C to the overnight access arrangements. Furthermore, I noted from the evidence of parties and the reports submitted that C was comfortable being alone with the Father. There was no evidence in the affidavits of C exhibiting any separation anxiety from the Mother. As such, I did not think that an order for overnight access upon C turning 5 years of age would cause the child unwarranted trauma.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     From the Mother’s affidavit and submissions against shared care and control, it was clear that the Mother was also concerned about the overbearingness of the Grandfather and the impact it would have on the Father and C, if C was to live at the Fathers’ family home. These concerns would apply as well if overnight access was to be ordered. However, I found these concerns to be speculative. While the Grandfather may have exhibited domineering behaviours towards the Mother, there is no evidence of such behaviour being exhibited towards the child. More importantly, I note that the Father is now better able to hold his ground and parent the child confidently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Since C would have regular weekly access to the Father on Wednesday (4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.) and Friday (4.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.) and almost the entire day Saturday from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., to allow parties to transition smoothly to overnight access, I allowed the Father to have overnight access to C from Friday, 4.30 p.m. to Sunday 9.30 a.m. This would ensure regularity for C and allow the Mother to have one day as well on the weekend with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     In relation to the orders for Public Holiday access, I noted that there were no objections from the Mother to the Father’s request at the hearings. As such, given that C would be with the Mother on the remaining three Public Holidays (namely Labour Day, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji) as understood by parties at the hearing, orders were made accordingly for the Father to have access to C on the requested Public Holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding Remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     This is a case where the relationship between parties unfortunately broke down due to the tension in the relationship between a newly established family unit and the extended family members. It is clear from the incidents set out in the affidavits that, while all involved had good intentions towards the child, the differences in values and approach in parenting amongst them resulted in hostility and acrimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     While it is true that the Mother and Father are the main persons responsible for their co-parental relationship, it is undeniable that the co-parental relationship is subject to challenges especially in situations where one party may be inextricably dependent on the emotional and psychological support provided by the extended family, unfortunately to the exclusion of the other party. For the co-parental relationship to be effective, it is therefore necessary for all parties involved to learn the importance of boundaries and equip themselves with the skills necessary to help build and support the co-parental relationship for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Nevertheless, I commend parties in the present case for their continued efforts in working on their co-parental relationship and I would like to encourage both parties to continue to create an environment where C may be able to benefit from having access to the love and support of both the maternal and paternal families in her life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I would also like to commend both counsels who represented parties in this matter for working tirelessly to help parties work out the care and access arrangements throughout the duration of this matter for the benefit of C.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary Matters – Care and control – Access"],"date":"2024-12-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2441 of 2023","title":"XCP v XCQ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 107","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32627-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Huang Junli, Christopher and Mr Dilys H Chua (CHP LAW LLC) for the plaintiff","Ms Hoon Shu Mei, Mr Goh Wei Sien Alex and Ms Tan Jia Yi (Drew & Napier LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-12-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>XCP v XCQ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCP <em>v</em> XCQ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32627-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 107</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2441 of 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">05 December 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kenneth Yap </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Mr Huang Junli, Christopher and Mr Dilys H Chua (CHP LAW LLC) for the plaintiff; Ms Hoon Shu Mei, Mr Goh Wei Sien Alex and Ms Tan Jia Yi (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCP — XCQ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Care and control</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Access</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">5 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was an ancillary matters hearing involving care and control and access to the single child of the marriage, who was four years of age. The parties had agreed to all financial matters (including maintenance), and had settled on joint custody by the time of the hearing. Both parties sought sole care and control of the child, with the Mother in particular resisting any overnight or overseas access by the Defendant Father on account of his alleged addiction to alcohol, gaming and pornography, as well as perceived inadequacies in his ability to care for the child. At the court’s behest, the Father underwent psychological assessment, which eventually ruled out safety concerns from alcohol consumption. I granted the Mother sole care and control as she has been the primary caregiver, and granted the Father one session of weekend overnight access and two sessions of weekday access, with overseas travel to be allowed from the age of six years. Additional safeguards and conditions were also imposed to address the Mother’s residual concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed this appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father and Mother married on 24 October 2014. The marriage lasted about nine years. Their daughter arrived on 9 May 2020, and they moved into their matrimonial home in December 2021, after which the relationship progressively broke down. Interim judgment was granted on 9 November 2023 by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of the hearing, the parties still resided together in their matrimonial home, although the Father had moved out of the master bedroom since the breakdown of the marriage in late September 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. They still managed to co-parent and exercised shared care over the child, with the Mother having private time with the child on Saturdays and the Father on Sundays. They had also agreed that each would have access to the child on alternating public holidays<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Both parents are working full-time. The Father’s job affords flexibility to work-from-home, whereas the Mother has to work full-time from the office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A total of 14 affidavits were filed in the present matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The parties each filed two Affidavits of Assets and Means (“AOM”), with leave granted for both to file a supplementary affidavit with regard to the Father’s alleged drinking habits during the observation period with the psychologist. The parties’ six affidavits are marked as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“MA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“FA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“MA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“FA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 3 July 2024 (“MA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 10 July 2024 (“FA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, both parties sought to bolster their cases with affidavits filed by their immediate family:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Paternal Grandmother, KBL, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGM-1” and “PGM-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Paternal Grandfather, LKH, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGF-1” and “PGF-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Paternal Uncle, LHB, filed two affidavits, on 14 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PU-1” and “PU-1” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother’s eldest sister, CWCY, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s younger sister, JWQL, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first heard parties on 11 April 2024. Given the safety concerns raised by the Mother about the Father’s alleged addiction to alcohol, I suggested and the Father agreed to attend before a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme to assess whether such concerns were founded. The psychologist was directed to tender a report thereafter, which would be open to the parties. I gave the Mother the liberty to file a supplementary affidavit restricted solely to her observations on the Father’s drinking habits from that point forward, and for the Father to have a right to reply. I also directed that no further audio or video recordings were to be made during this period, save for any incidents of loss of control due to the alleged intake of alcohol, and for parties to abstain from disparaging each other in the presence of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the next hearing on 15 July 2024, parties made further oral submissions of the psychologist’s report and their supplementary affidavits. I rendered decision with brief grounds at the hearing. Parties subsequently wrote in with further clarifications, and after a third hearing on 23 August 2024 (“the clarificatory hearing”), adjustments were made to some of the access orders. I gave leave for the time for appeal to run from this latest hearing, and the Father filed his appeal on 5 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s position was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She should have sole care and control to the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father should have daytime access only until the child reached the age of 12 or after her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), whichever is the later, and with overnight and/or overseas access to commence thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For ease of exposition, I have grouped the Mother’s arguments under eight broad headings as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Preservation of Status Quo.</b> The Mother claims she has been the primary caregiver since the child’s birth, and has maintained sole care and control over the child since the commencement of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, with the Father effectively having only daytime access to the child. Apart from a change in the residence expected in November 2024 when the matrimonial home would be sold, there would be no material change to the child’s life if she was under the Mother’s sole care, as the Mother would continue to oversee her usual schooling, enrichment and weekend routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.

According to the Mother, the Father would drink multiple times a week to excess, both at home and externally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and would go on drinking sessions with his friends at least two to three times a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.

On occasions when he drank to excess, the Mother claimed that the Father was unable to coordinate his movements, and would often barge into the bedroom while inebriated to check on the child or to kiss or hug the child who was already asleep<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.

He also points out that the Mother takes the child out for the entire Sunday instead of spending the weekend together<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Father also alleged that the Mother would question the child repeatedly after she had spent time with the Father and nitpick about how he looked after the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Second, the Father claims the Mother excludes him from important decisions concerning the child, such as enrolment in pre-school, enrichment classes and applying for a passport<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Third, he claims the Mother discourages bonding between father and child by making sarcastic and disparaging remarks on his efforts, for example when he reads bedtime stories to the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> or buys toys for the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, or interrupting them when they were watching television<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> or reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.

In contrast, the Father claims that there are multiple instances where he corrects the child for bad behaviour toward the Mother, such as when the child hit the mother, scratched the mother, bit the Mother, clawed the Mother, and poked the Mother in the eye<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. In 2023, the Father had even bought a birthday gift for the child to pass to her Mother, and reminded her to wish the Mother a happy birthday<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>The Mother falsely paints the Father as violent and a pornography addict.</b> The Father claims the Mother falsely alleges that he has committed domestic violence.

Next, he claims the Mother relied on false evidence to portray him as a pornography addict, by alleging that he left his sex paraphernalia in easily accessible locations<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. The Father claimed that these items were stored in a locked drawer and that she had unlocked the drawer in order to take photographs of the paraphernalia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <b>The Father has a strong familial support network compared to the Mother.</b> According to the Father, prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the paternal grandparents would drop off groceries for the child, visit at the matrimonial home on Friday and Sunday evenings and on an ad-hoc basis, and pick the child from her pre-school daily<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. This interaction was only stopped at the Mother’s request around September to October 2022, with the paternal grandparents seeing the child on Sunday evenings during the Father’s access time. The Father adds that the child is familiar with her paternal uncle and aunt (his brother)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, joining them for outings and occasionally being fetched from pre-school by her aunt. Given the Father’s intention to live with the child at his parents’ residence, where two bedrooms have been earmarked for the child and himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>, he submits that the living arrangement in his parents’ house would foster bonds within the larger family and provide additional support for the child. The Father also points out that it may not be appropriate for the Mother to rely on her two sisters for the care of the child, given that the elder sister is a habitual smoker and has an older romantic partner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <b>The Father is receptive of feedback and the Mother’s parenting concerns.</b> The Father claims that since the birth of the child, he has materially cut down his alcohol consumption and effectively stopped smoking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. He disputes the Mother’s claims that he continued his lifestyle of drinking and hanging out with his friends to the wee hours of the morning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. He also claims to have drastically cut down the time he spends playing video games<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, denies that he is addicted to gaming, and assures he would not expose the child to any inappropriate video game content<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. In any case, the Father was willing to propose a mutual undertaking that (1) there would be no consumption of alcohol in the child’s presence, (2) any sex paraphernalia would be kept out of sight from the child, (3) there would be no playing of inappropriate video games in the child’s presence, and (4) that no family violence would be committed against the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the alternative, the Father submits that if the Court is not minded to grant him sole care and control, he would request for shared care and control. He argues that it would be in the best interest of a young child to have the benefit of care from two loving parents, ensuring that both parents would fully engage in the child’s care without excluding the other. The Father points out that even after the breakdown of the marriage, the living arrangements were akin to shared care and control, and it would be in the best interests of the child to preserve the status quo in their living arrangements (see <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> [F2BOA Tab 26]). In particular, on weekday mornings, the Father would participate in the child’s morning routine, after the Mother takes her to pre-school. Upon the child’s return, the parties would take turns to care for the child, including bathing her, playing with her and reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. On weekends, while the child is at home in the morning or after dinner at night, both parties would take turn to care for her and participate in her bedtime routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, the Father points out that this is not a case where the parties hold intractable hostility against each other, as they could continue to live together and managed to agree on the reasons for divorce as well as the financial issues in the Ancillary Matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Should the Father fail to obtain sole or shared care, he proposes access over two weekdays, with an additional weekday when the child turns six years of age. He also took the view that he should be granted weekend overnight access immediately when parties move out of the matrimonial home. He reiterates he is a hands-on and involved parent, and has drastically reduced his alcohol consumption and intends to be in good health so he can provide for his child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. In any event, even if the Mother still had concerns, overnight access would take place in the paternal grandparents’ residence where there were additional hands to support the Father as needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father also submitted for half of school holiday access, and for overseas access to commence immediately, with permission to take two short trips of up to seven days each year. After entering primary school, he wishes to have overseas access during his half of the school holidays, subject to the usual orders in relation to the provision of travel itinerary, accommodation and flight details, contact numbers and the handing over of the passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allegations of Alcohol, Pornography and Gaming Addictions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The primary objection that the Mother raised against the Father’s care was her view that his alleged addictions presented a safety threat to the child. While I appreciated the Mother’s protective instincts in relation to the child, I will explain why I did not find sufficient evidence of safety risks that would justify a restriction of only daytime access between the Father and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To address the concern about alcoholic addiction, at the suggestion of the Court, the Father voluntarily underwent a series of sessions with a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme. Dr Matthew Woo, a private psychologist of 20 years’ experience who was previously the lead psychologist at the Department of Forensic Psychiatry under the Institute of Mental Health, saw the Father over seven sessions from 26 April 2024 to 21 June 2024 (“the observation period”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In Dr Woo’s report dated 15 July 204, he noted that the Father admitted that he consumed alcohol an average of three times a week, with two to three glasses of alcohol per session, over the previous three years. Dr Woo noted that this was at the borderline of the minimum criteria set by the Health Promotion Board of no more than two standard drinks a day for men. Crucially, Dr Woo observed that over the observation period, the Father had not shown any signs of alcohol use, let alone alcohol dependence. He noted that the Father had taken alcohol-free beer as a substitute for alcohol, and attained very healthy breath analyser readings of 0.000% BAC in his self-conducted tests after psychological treatment began on 26 April 2024. In the course of therapy, the Father had reported four trigger situations which would give him the urge to drink alcohol, namely taking meals which included sashimi, salmon or cheese, as well as stressful situations at the workplace which would give him headaches. Dr Woo shared that these urges were processed with Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR), and noted the Father’s persistence in reducing or desensitising his urges to drink to a zero rating for these triggers. At the end of the observation period, Dr Woo therefore concluded that the Father’s behaviour at home was not under any influence of alcohol, and that there “is simply no evidence of safety issues with respect to child custody”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In her supplementary affidavit, the Mother nevertheless expressed the view that the Father’s dependency on non-alcoholic substitute drinks belied his persistent emotional association with alcohol, and opined that he may not be able to resist such cravings beyond the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. She also voiced her suspicion that the Father had disposed of glass bottles and cans furtively in the night, and suggests that he could have consumed alcohol outside of the home on the 14 nights during the observation period where was either staying at his parents’ home or on an overseas trip<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>. She also notes that the Father had repeatedly attempted to moderate his drinking throughout the marriage, but would fail and lapse into uncontrollable alcoholic binges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. She thus had serious doubts about the sustainability of his efforts during the observation period, and feared that once the scrutiny of court proceedings was over, he would revert to his long-held drinking habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In his supplementary affidavit, the Father explained that after the first hearing on 11 April 2024, he had disposed of whatever alcohol was in the home and had turned off his wine chiller. He had also started taking frequent breathalyser tests with accompanying video footage, the results of which showed he had zero alcohol content on his breath<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. He submitted that his switch to non-alcoholic beers was testament to his determination to change his behaviour, and he denied the Mother’s accusations that he was hiding his drinking habits during the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     On balance, I accepted Dr Woo’s opinion that the Father had not shown signs of alcohol consumption, and certainly did not present any safety risk over the course of the observation period. The Mother’s doubts as to whether the Father was still consuming alcohol over this period are speculatory and I am unable to ascribe weight to her views. As to whether there may be safety risks that may arise after the scrutiny of therapy and court proceedings is over, I do note that even when the Father had drunk to excess in the past and exhibited allegedly aggressive behaviour at home, there was never any proof that such aggression was directed against the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     To allay this residual concern on the Mother’s part, I directed that the Father take a breath analyser test before each session of access for the next six months and to preserve a photo record of such test results with the appropriate date and time stamp. These records need not be shared with the Mother and should be retained by the Father for a further six months from the point of the test. The purpose of this procedure is to assure parties that in the event of any future incident or further court proceeding, these records may be made available as evidence. This was intended to provide practical deterrence to ensure the Father abstains from alcohol, without presenting an unreasonable imposition on his privacy and dignity. With the Father’s recent efforts and this practical safeguard in place, I did not think the issue of his past alcoholic consumption would detract from his ability to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Turning to the concern about the Father’s possession of sexual paraphernalia, I note that there was no actual incident where the child had been exposed to the Father’s collection of objects. There was also no suggestion that the Father had behaved inappropriately in any way with his daughter. With regard to the Mother’s expressed concern about the Father hugging and kissing the child, I did not find these to be anything other than normal expressions of parental love towards a young child. I accordingly think that an undertaking as proposed by the father to keep any sexual paraphernalia away from the view of the child would sufficiently address the Mother’s concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, on the issue of gaming addiction, I likewise took the view that an undertaking that no age-inappropriate gaming would take place in the presence of the child would address this concern. The Father would be well aware that any breach of this undertaking would be easily shared by the child with the Mother, which should provide sufficient deterrence against such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For these reasons, I did not find the allegations relating to various addictions to be sufficient cause to restrict the Father to only daytime access with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Sole Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I turn next to the opposing positions on which parent should be granted sole care and control over the child. It is axiomatic that when exercising the power under s 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to place the child in the care and control of either or both parents, the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child (per s 125(2)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is also trite that where all factors are equal between the parties, greater weight is ascribed to the maternal bond between a mother and an infant child. In the oft-cited case of <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>, the Court of Appeal held, in regard to a four-year old child, that a child at a tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs, at [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All other things being equal, a very important factor to bear in mind was that we were dealing with an extremely young infant. We felt that the maternal bond between the appellant and the infant was a pivotal consideration here. The bond between the natural mother and her child is one of the most unexplainable wonders of human nature. It should never be taken for granted or slighted…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In <em>Chan Kah Cheong Kenneth v Teoh Kheng Yau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 2 SLR(R) 0595.xml')\">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 595</a>, MPH Rubin J held that, if all the factors were equal between the parties, then probably it was right for a child of tender years to be brought up by his natural mother. We should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. It is only a natural conclusion that, by reason of his very tender, young age, the infant would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The significance of the maternal bond was earlier highlighted as a relevant factor in determining the issue of care and control in <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>, where the Court of Appeal held at [22] and [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22.    We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these: (a) the conduct of the parties; (b) the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion; <b>(c) a young child would be best looked after by its mother</b>; (d) which party can offer better security and stability; and (e) that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The significant weight to be given to the maternal bond is bolstered in this case by the fact that the Mother has been and remains the primary caregiver of the child. While the Father has made effort to participate actively in the child’s daily routine, it is clear that he is not the parent in charge of the child’s daily welfare. The notion of primary caregiving is not just one of effort or contribution, but rather which parent places the greatest time, energy and priority of the child over and above his or her own personal needs. There is no doubt in my mind that the Mother places the greatest priority on and has the closer bond with the child, and ranks the welfare and developmental needs of the child above her own. Coupled with the importance of preserving the maternal bond for a young child, this factor clearly shifts the issue of sole care in the Mother’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The next factor I considered in deciding the issue of care and control is which party offers better stability and security for the child. Both residential arrangements put forth by the parents, i.e. the Mother’s family home and the home of the paternal grandparents, provide familiarity and continuity to the child. Both households also have family members able to support and step in to assist with the management of the child. Despite certain aspersions cast against each parents’ family members, I did not find there to be any negative factors which militated against the choice of either household. Accordingly, I considered this to be an equally balanced factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I turn next to parenting style and capability. Much ink has been spilled in a running diatribe between the parties on how the other’s parenting techniques are deficient or even dangerous. Such disagreements are not uncommon even in healthy marriages, where fathers are sometimes perceived to be overly permissive, hands-off and insufficiently attentive, while mothers are critiqued for being overly strict, over-protective or overbearing in relation to the upbringing of the child. I say this not to trivialise the validity of such differences of opinion, but to highlight that differing parenting methods and approaches are par for the course, and that it is incumbent for parties to come to terms on a course best suited to the particular characteristics of their child. By all accounts, the child in this case does appear to have some issues with discipline, and acts out against the controlling parent when she does not get her way. While the Father critiques the Mother for being high-handed in disciplining the child, the reality is that parenting can be exasperating even for the most temperate of parents, and I did not find that the Mother had reacted out of line whenever the child acted up against her. On the other hand, I did not agree with the Mother that the Father’s permissive parenting style was necessarily deficient. In truth, a combination of differing parenting styles may be workable and even beneficial in the co-parenting process. It is not uncommon that a child abides by the disciplinary parent and seeks levity and respite with the relaxed parent. Accordingly, despite the minutiae of criticisms levied between the parties, I did not find either parenting style to be detrimental to the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As for parenting capability, it is clear in my view that the Mother is more involved and committed to the care of the child than the Father, having been the primary caregiver since the birth of the child. While the Father has contributed significantly to and has been actively involved in the child’s care, he has never been <em>solely</em> responsible for the child’s welfare for protracted periods of time. In this regard it is clear that the Mother is the far stronger candidate for sole care and control as compared to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, the Father also argued that care should devolve to him due to significant gatekeeping behaviour on the part of the Mother, which would undermine the viability of any terms of access. While it is true that care and control may go to the parent who was more facilitative and reasonable about access (per <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> at [45]), I did not find the Mother guilty of alienation or gatekeeping in any true sense of the word. Quite to the contrary, the very fact that the Mother continued to stay in the matrimonial home until it was sold, and was willing to allow the Father a full day of weekend access to the child in the interim, was telling of her willingness to cooperate with the Father for the sake of the child. This factor was accordingly not helpful to the Father’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Having considered all the above factors, I was of the view that the decision on sole care and control should weigh heavily in favour of the Mother, given the significance of the maternal bond and her role as the primary caregiver of the child since birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Before coming to a final decision, I also considered the Father’s alternative proposition for shared care and control. In considering whether an order for shared care and control would be in the best interest of the child, the court would consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind her age and personality, to live in two homes (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father points out that the parties are able to effectively co-parent at present, and that shared care would essentially be a preservation of the status quo, which would in the usual circumstance be the best choice for preserving the stability of the welfare of the child (per <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, at [34]). However, I would point out that the current arrangement where the child lives with both parents cannot be continued because the matrimonial home is due for sale. A regime of shared care would therefore not be a preservation of the status quo. With shared care, the child would need to transition to an arrangement where she spent equal time between two homes, one in Punggol and the other in River Valley. She would also have to alternate between two different extended families, with wholly different parenting values, habits and expectations, which may only diverge more markedly over time as the parents lead their separate lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While it is true that a young child who has yet to commence formal education may be more suited to a shared care and control arrangement (per <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [109], and <em>UPK v UPL <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22321-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 92</a></em> at [26]), the reality is that it would be a significant adjustment for the child to spend equal time between two extended families which would have equal control and influence over her life. I am not convinced how this would be beneficial rather than disruptive to the child’s life. On the other hand, maintaining the Mother as the sole caregiver would provide a measure of stability and security to the child that would mitigate the disruption brought about by the divorce. The child would still preserve her bond with her Father if sufficient latitude is given to him for access. I therefore declined to order shared care and control as proposed by the Father, and granted the Mother sole care and control over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overnight Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given my earlier reasoning that the Mother’s concerns of safety regarding the Father’s alleged addictions was not borne out, I did not find any reason to deny the Father overnight access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Indeed, the Court should be slow to deny a parent overnight access, given the benefits that extended access brings to the development of the parent-child bond (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [29]-[30]). I note too that the age of the child in itself is not a strong reason for allowing or denying the other parent overnight access (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> at [32]). The importance of overnight access was succinctly explained by District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang in <b><em>VZP v VZQ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27068-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 8</a> at [25] in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Child should be equally entitled to overnight access with the father as he is with the mother, unless there is evidence to disprove either party’s eligibility, such as a history of abusive or negligent parenting. Even though the Children are asleep during a part of the overnight access, there is an intangible value of building up familiarity, being able to say good morning to or to have a particular storybook read by the parent before the Children go to bed, these are important opportunities to build bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I was therefore minded to allow one session of overnight weekend access to the Father each week, from 9 pm on Saturday to 9 pm on Sunday. This would enable both parents to have an equal share of weekend time, while ensuring that the child returned home with sufficient leeway to settle down before the weekday routine began.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     To ensure that the child receives the best care possible, and also mindful that the Father has not been in sole care of the child for an extended period of time, I added the condition that the child is to reside at the home of the Father’s parents during such overnight access, as their support would be especially helpful in the management of a child at a tender age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the clarificatory hearing, the Father requested for the Mother to drop off the child for his weekend access on Saturday 9 pm at the paternal grandparents’ house in River Valley. The Mother objected as her routine involved attending church at Suntec City in the evening followed by dinner nearby from 7.30 pm to 8.30 pm, which would either be at the same location or near Raffles City or Dhoby Ghaut MRT. As the Mother did not drive, it would be difficult for her to send the child to River Valley thereafter. Given that the Father drives and for the benefit of the young child’s welfare, I directed that the child be picked up for handover at Suntec City (save where there are road closures in any part of town), Dhoby Ghaut MRT or Raffles City, and for the Mother to inform the Father of the exact location at least one hour beforehand. The Mother then sought the limitation that the pickup be done by the Father alone, as the grandparents were elderly and may be unable to handle the child’s temper tantrums. I did not think it necessary to impose this limitation on the Father, when there was no evidence of inability to manage the child on the part of the paternal grandparents. I did however refine the direction to specify that the pickup of the child should be restricted to immediate family members only (i.e. excluding a domestic helper or some other third party), given the young age of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Finally, to forestall future disputes regarding the use of weekend time for external activities, I directed that the allocation of time for co-curricular and enrichment activities should fall equally between each parent’s period of weekend access, with any excess allocation to be subject to agreement by both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overnight Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Turning to weekday access, I granted the Father access to the child over two weekday evenings on Wednesday and Thursday, from the time the child is picked up from childcare or school to 8:30 pm. At the clarificatory hearing, the Mother requested for a change of days to Tuesday and Thursday, as she wished to undertake volunteering activities for the purposes of future primary school application on Tuesday. The Father objected to this as he would be tied up with work on Tuesday. As the Father’s commitment appeared more immutable, I declined the Mother’s request to amend the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, to afford flexibility, I directed that should access not be practicable on any given session, the Father should in the alternative be granted video access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     As agreed by parties, the sessions of access would also be subject to the undertakings of both parties not to consume alcohol, play age-inappropriate video games or expose the child to any sexually inappropriate objects during the period of care over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overseas Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As for overseas access, I repeat my earlier observation that the Father had hitherto not taken sole charge of the child for a protracted period of time. I was of the view that overseas access should be introduced in a staggered fashion, with a requirement of accompaniment by either the paternal grandparents or the paternal aunt from the age of six to nine years of age. After the age of nine years, the Father should be able to take the child for overseas access alone, as the child would be more mature and the Father would have more experienced in the exclusive care of the child. Accordingly, the following directions were made regarding overseas access by the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Overseas access with the Father commences when the child reaches 6 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such access should be for no more than 7 days at a time, and shall not exceed two times a year without the consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any overseas access should also be in the company of either parent of the Father or the sister-in-law of the Father, until the child reaches the age of 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The exact dates of such overseas access should be notified no less than one month in advance to the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The passport of the child is to be handed over seven days before the commencement of travel and returned seven days after the conclusion of travel. At the clarificatory hearing, an additional condition was added that neither party should withhold consent to renew the passport without reasonable cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Each parent should have daily video access to the child when the child is travelling with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_g\"></a>(g)     For the avoidance of doubt, overseas trips take priority over regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father also sought clarification whether a staycation would be allowed for his overnight access prior to the child turning six years of age. Mindful that overnight access was ordered to be at the paternal grandparent’s residence to ensure that the Father was well-supported while the child was young, I declined to allow staycations prior to the age of six years old. I would however leave it to parties to exercise reason within the spirit of the order, for e.g. if the paternal grandparents were to join the overnight staycation, I would not see any reason why such a variation should not be acceded to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other Access Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With regard to school holidays, a similar stepped-up approach was applied. Once the child commences primary school, the Father would have additional daytime access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, with the school holidays equally shared once the child turns nine years of age. This accords with the earlier reasoning that the Father should enjoy greater access once there was greater familiarity over the child’s care, at an age when the child is more mature and independent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The following is a summary of the orders made regarding public and school holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Public holiday access is to alternate between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During school holidays when the child commences primary school, the Father shall additionally have access on Weds and Thurs from 10 am to 8.30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the child turns nine years of age, school holiday access is to be equally shared (which will include overnight access). The Father will be granted access for the first half of any school holiday in the first and odd years of every calendar year, and will be granted the second half of the school holiday in even years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties suggested that there be video call access every other evening from 5.30 to 6.00 pm during uninterrupted periods of access. I agreed and so directed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For each parent’s birthday, as well as Mother’s and Father’s Day, the respective parent would have access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, and this would supersede any other direction on regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On the child’s birthday access, the parent without access on that day would be granted two hours of access with the child, with the exact hours of access to be agreed between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_g\"></a>(g)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties also agreed that if for any reason a period of access would fall under one hour, there would be no need for the other parent to hand over the child for this short period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On the issue of costs, I considered that while both sides did not fully prevail in their arguments before the Court, the final outcome was more aligned with what counsel revealed to be the Father’s without prejudice offer. Accordingly, I directed that costs of $1,500 (all-in) be paid by the Mother to the Father.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\"

class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">13 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       A personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) is intended to protect a family member from family violence. Can a PPO be revoked on the sole basis that the person it seeks to protect (“<b>protected person</b>”) has allegedly abused the order? How should a court deal with an application to revoke a PPO where the applicant is alleged to have breached the order? These are some of the issues raised in SS 1031 of 2024 (“<b>SS 1031</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 1031 is the Applicant’s request to revoke a PPO made against him. The PPO was imposed in 2018 pursuant to an application by his ex-wife (“<b>Respondent</b>”). Under the PPO, the Applicant is not to commit family violence against the Respondent and her son (his stepson).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties’ marriage was dissolved in February 2024. Following the divorce –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent has care and control of her daughter (D.O.B.: January 2016) that she bore with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     She resides with her daughter and her son (now 21 years old) in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant resides with his mother in the next block of flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of this judgement, the Respondent has a fiancé. They are due to be married in December 2024. The Applicant, on the other hand, has a girlfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ position </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Applicant provides two reasons to support his application to revoke the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he alleges that the Respondent has “abused” the PPO – namely, (i) by making false complaints to the Police that he had breached the order,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (ii) by picking arguments with him so that she could play the “victim”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and (iii) by harassing and slandering him on social media.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Applicant submits that the PPO is no longer necessary. It was granted six years ago. The parties are now residing in different households and there has been no recent incident of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Respondent strong denies the Applicant’s allegations and objects to his application. According to the Respondent, the PPO is still necessary for the protection of her son and herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summary of decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the evidence and submissions, I dismiss the application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged abuse of PPO not proved</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with the Applicant’s first reason as to why the PPO ought to be revoked – namely that the Respondent has allegedly “abused” the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Requirement for revocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, it should be noted that the mere fact that a protected person may have “abused” a PPO is not a sufficient basis to revoke the order. This is because the test for revocation is <em>whether a PPO is still necessary</em> to protect that person. To succeed in a revocation application, the applicant must thus prove that he/she “is unlikely” to commit family violence in future: s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). This position is well settled: see e.g., <em>Joycelyn Toh Hui Yu v Toh Siew Luan Bette</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0275.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 275</a> at [17(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     To be clear, the above position does not mean that a protected person can use a PPO as an instrument of oppression. Depending on the circumstances, a person who has been victimised by a protected person can apply for a PPO against the latter. Additionally, the protected person may also be criminally liable, e.g., under s 182 of the Penal Code 1871 if he/she makes a false police report that a PPO has been breached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Allegations of abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In his affidavit, the Applicant referred to several incidents where the Respondent had allegedly “abused” the PPO. During the hearing, he agreed to focus on four of them. I will now address each of these allegations, <em>first</em>, whether the Applicant has proved these four incidents of “abuse”, and <em>second</em>, whether the PPO is no longer necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2 June 2024 incident – Applicant checking on his daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I begin with an incident on 2 June 2024. (This incident occurred just <em>one day before</em> the Applicant filed his application to revoke the PPO.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>) His account of this incident is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On that day at about 2.00 am, while in the carpark, the Applicant noticed that the light in the matrimonial flat’s master-bedroom was switched on. The Applicant decided to check on his daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On entering the flat unit, the Applicant saw that nobody was at home. Anxious at being unable to find his daughter, the Applicant phoned the Respondent to check. The Respondent responded with vulgarities and told him to wait with his girlfriend at the void deck for her to come over. The Applicant made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the Applicant returned to the matrimonial flat, the Respondent refused to let him enter, claiming that she had been advised to do so by the Investigation Officer (“<b>IO</b>”). The Applicant called the IO. The latter denied having given such advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She was in fact at home with her children at the material time. At about 2.39 am, she received a phone call from an unknown woman who screamed and used vulgarities at her. The woman also asked her to go to the void deck. When the Respondent looked over the parapet, she saw the Applicant and another man downstairs. They were walking towards her block in an unsteady manner – apparently under the influence of alcohol.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Soon thereafter, the Applicant was outside the matrimonial flat. He scolded the Respondent and threatened to bash her up. He did not request to speak to the daughter at all material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A few minutes later, the Respondent heard the Applicant shouting from the carpark and asking her to come down. (According to the Respondent, she has a <em>voice recording</em> of this. She however did not tender the recording as evidence because it was not transcribed.) The Applicant stopped shouting on being alerted by his girlfriend and his male companion that the Respondent was recording the incident. The Respondent tendered a video recording of the incident as evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Later, the Applicant, his girlfriend, and his male companion took turns to call the Respondent’s handphone. In these calls, they scolded her and threatened to beat her up. The Respondent hung up the phone and called the Police. During the trial, she tendered her call log to prove that she had received numerous phone calls from the Applicant, his girlfriend and an unidentified number at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Police eventually arrived at the scene. Police officer(s) told the Respondent that the Applicant had been drinking under her block of flats. According to her, the Police could confirm that her daughter was in the flat unit at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Respondent believes that the 2 June incident was triggered by a video that she had posted regarding the Applicant’s girlfriend on 30 May 2024. According to the Respondent, this posting irritated the Applicant. Since then, he had started to threaten her over the phone. Before posting the video, the Applicant was fine. The Respondent understands from the IO that the police investigations into the 2 June incident have been completed, and that the matter is now with the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I find that the Applicant has “not proved” his case regarding the 2 June incident on a balance of probabilities. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is unusual that a right-thinking father would choose to visit his eight-year-old daughter in the middle of the night <em>at 2.00 am</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is an <em>inexplicable gap</em> in the Applicant’s evidence. Based on his account, he had gone to the matrimonial flat twice. On the first occasion, he had entered the flat unit and found that no one was at home. On the second occasion, the Respondent was in the flat unit and refused to let him enter. The duration between these two occasions would have been brief. Based on the Applicant’s evidence, the Respondent had mysteriously turned up at the unit. (This is despite she having told him to wait at the void deck for her.) The Applicant did not explain how this was possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, I find the Respondent’s evidence that she and her children were resting at home at about 2.00 am to be inherently more credible. Furthermore, her evidence that the Applicant, his girlfriend, and another man had called her phone at the material time is also supported by her call log.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     For clarity, in coming to the finding in [15(c)], I did not rely on the video recording tendered by the Respondent. I find this recording to be a neutral piece of evidence. As the Applicant had rightly submitted, the recording does not contain any audio and thus does not prove that the Applicant was shouting at the material time. In any event, the Applicant does not dispute the fact that he was in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the time of the recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To be clear, the finding in [15] above does not mean that I have found any of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Applicant has lied about the 2 June incident,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Respondent has “disproved” the Applicant’s case about the incident, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That she has “proved” her own account of the incident to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>(For a discussion on the concepts of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved”, see s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893; <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0286.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 286</a> at [18] to [21]; <em>R Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0063.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 63</a> at [35].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I emphatically decline to make the affirmative findings in [16] above. Such findings would have been based purely on the <em>testimonial</em> evidence by the Applicant and the Respondent only. I do not think that this is appropriate in the present case. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I do not have the benefit of important pieces of evidence that can shed light on what really happened during the 2 June incident. Such evidence includes the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       A voice recording of the Applicant asking the Respondent to come down from the matrimonial flat: see [13(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Evidence (e.g., from police officers present at the scene) on (1) whether the daughter was in the flat at the material time (see [12(b)] and [13(a)] above), (2) whether the Applicant appeared to intoxicated (see [13(e)] above), (3) whether he was in the company of his girlfriend and another male person (see [13(c)] and [13(d)] above), and (4) the Applicant’s and Respondent’s contemporaneous accounts to the police officers of what had transpired during the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Police have completed their investigations into the 2 June incident. The matter is now before AGC, presumably for a decision on whether there is any offence disclosed against the Applicant and/or the Respondent, and if so, whether to prosecute the relevant party. An affirmative finding by me, such as those in [16] above, (i) can potentially engage the principle of <em>res judicata</em> on some of the relevant factual issues, and (ii) can have implications on the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion and subsequent criminal proceedings, if any. Given the limitations of fact finding in [17(a)] above, it is best that I exercise judicial modesty and refrain from making affirmative findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To sum-up, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the 2 June incident had occurred in the manner described by the Applicant. Furthermore, even on his account, I fail to see in what way the Respondent’s actions amount to an “abuse” of the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">29 June 2024 incident – Respondent’s visit to the mother’s flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I now turn to another incident which, according to the Applicant, demonstrates that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 29 June 2024, together with her son and other person(s), the Respondent “trespassed” into his mother’s flat unit. At the material time, his mother was alone. The Applicant came to know of this “trespass” when the Respondent’s son, and later the Respondent herself, made threatening calls to him and told him to go down to the mother’s flat. The Police was eventually summoned and the incident was defused thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Applicant tendered a video recording of the events at the flat unit as evidence. According to him, the recording showed the Respondent to be have snatched his mother’s handphone and to be behaving aggressively in the flat. The Applicant submitted that if the Respondent had been fearful of him, she would not have behaved in such a manner and demanded to see him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the Applicant, his mother was deeply disturbed by the Respondent’s actions on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent was troubled by the 2 June incident. On 29 June 2024, she had gone to seek the mother’s help to stop the Applicant and his girlfriend from creating problems for her and her children. The Respondent knew that the Applicant was not at home at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had entered the mother’s flat unit with her son and a female relative. While in the unit, the Respondent admitted that she had taken the mother’s phone. According to her, she merely wanted the mother to call the Applicant and to tell him to stop the harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the visit, the Respondent saw the mother at the market on 5 August 2024. The mother called out to her, and they spoke normally. Later that same day, the mother phoned the Respondent. (This call is reflected in the Respondent’s call log.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>) She submitted that if the mother had felt threatened by her due to the 29 June incident, the mother would not have spoken to her. The Respondent recorded her conversation with the mother on 5 August 2024. She however did not tender the recording in evidence because she could not afford the transcription fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my view, the Applicant has failed to prove his case that the 29 June incident was an example of the Respondent having “abused” the PPO. Specifically, the Applicant has failed to show how the Respondent had used the PPO to legitimise or excuse her conduct at his mother’s flat unit. I accept the Respondent’s reasons for going to the mother’s flat and that she was not there to create trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is clear from the recording that the Respondent was emotional at certain points during the visit. For instance, she broke down when she spoke to the Applicant’s mother – at times, telling her son that it was not the mother’s fault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This is consistent with the Respondent’s evidence that she was genuinely concerned and stressed by what the Applicant had done during the 2 June incident, and that she had gone to the flat to seek the mother’s help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it appears from the videos<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the Respondent’s son was also crying/sobbing when he spoke to the Applicant’s mother. At times, he was rubbing his eyes with what appears to be white tissue paper. There was also a moment when the son told the Respondent that he loved the Applicant’s mother, and the Respondent acknowledged this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, throughout her interaction with the Respondent and her son, the Applicant’s mother appears to be calm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, and importantly, the only other person who can discredit the Respondent’s evidence regarding the purpose of her visit on 29 June is the Applicant’s mother. She would have been able to testify, for instance, what had transpired during the visit and what the Respondent and her son had said to her. The Applicant did not call his mother to rebut the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Given the above, I find that the 29<sup></sup>June incident does not prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">16 September 2024 incident – Applicant’s visit to the matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to next incident which the Applicant relies on to prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 16 September 2024, the Applicant visited the matrimonial flat intending to see his daughter. On arriving at the flat unit, the Respondent’s fiancé, who was shirtless at the material time, came out from one of the rooms and started to provoke him. The Respondent and her son stood nearby, supporting the fiancé.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fiancé challenged the Applicant to a fight, and the ensuing argument continued out into the corridor. The Applicant remained calm throughout as his daughter was present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The fiancé and the Respondent later returned to the flat unit. The latter locked the gate, claiming that the IO had told her not to open the gate for him. The Applicant called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Police arrived at the scene, the fiancé eventually left the flat unit angrily and reluctantly, on the Police’s request. The Applicant tendered a video recording of the incident to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent’s evidence regarding the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant had gone to the matrimonial flat to look for his daughter. The visit was unexpected as 16 September 2024 was not his child access day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Respondent, the Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the material time and had behaved in an abusive and provocative manner towards her fiancé. When her son tried to intervene because the Applicant was standing too close to her, the Applicant smacked his chest and verbally abused him. When the Respondent intervened, the Applicant grabbed her hand tightly. She managed to pull her hand away and her fiancé stepped in to de-escalate the matter. The Respondent called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent understood from the IO that the Police have completed their investigations into the 16 September incident, and that the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is the Applicant’s case that the Respondent is using the PPO to prevent him from visiting the matrimonial flat to see his daughter. According to him, the Respondent is doing this so that she can cohabit with her fiancé in the matrimonial flat without any interference from the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I find that the events during the 16 September incident do not support the Applicant’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant’s case assumes that he had the right to see his daughter on 16 September 2024 and that the Respondent had wrongfully prevented him from doing so. This assumption is not correct. According to the Respondent, (i) 16 September 2024 was not the Applicant’s child access day, and (ii) he had turned up at the matrimonial flat without giving any prior notice. The Applicant did not dispute this aspect of the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is evident from the video that the Applicant was unhappy with the fiancé’s presence in the flat and had taunted the Respondent, her son, and her fiancé. Given the tension at the material time, there could be safety issues if the Applicant was allowed into the flat. In the circumstances, the Respondent’s decision not to let the Applicant into the flat is understandable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, I find the Applicant’s claim that the Respondent has an ulterior motive to prevent him from seeing his daughter to be highly speculative. He has offered no evidence to prove that the fiancé was cohabiting with the Respondent in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given the above, I find that the Applicant has failed to prove that the 29<sup></sup>June incident is an example where the Respondent had “abused” the PPO for an alleged ulterior motive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">May to December 2023 – Respondent’s messages</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Finally, according to the Applicant, between May to December 2023, the Respondent (a) had made repeated phone calls and sent numerous messages to harass him and his girlfriend and (b) had posted libellous comments on social media against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Respondent denied making some of the relevant posts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> She explained that her (Facebook) account had been hacked at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I have difficulty accepting the Respondent’s explanation. For instance, there is no reason why the alleged hacker would send the relevant posts – e.g., new year greetings, and vitriolic comments on the affair between the Applicant and his girlfriend. Additionally, some of the posts contain information that is personal to the Respondent. That said, a determination of whether the Respondent’s Facebook account had been hacked is best made after forensic analysis has been done on the account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In any event, assuming that the relevant messages, phone calls, and posts were by the Respondent, I fail to see how they would amount to be an “abuse” of the PPO that warrants its revocation. For instance, there is no evidence that the Respondent had used the PPO as a shield for sending the objectionable messages, phone calls and posts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Applicant submits that the PPO should be revoked because the Respondent is not afraid of him or to do things which offends him. In my view, this argument does not take his case far. The central issue remains whether the Respondent and her son require the PPO for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO is still necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     This neatly brings me to the Applicant’s second reason for his application. According to him, the PPO is no longer necessary because the parties are now living apart and there has been no recent incident of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is well settled that the mere fact that parties have divorced and are no longer residing together do not constitute sufficient grounds for revoking a PPO: see e.g., <em>IS v IT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46932-M.xml')\">[2005] SGDC 66</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the present case, even though the parties are now living in separate households, I cannot rule out the possibility that the Applicant is likely to commit family violence in future. These are my reasons for coming to this view.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the parties will still need to interact with each other when the Applicant exercises his child access rights at the Respondent’s place of residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is still tension in the parties’ relationship. One of the causes for this tension is the Applicant’s unhappiness and concern that the fiancé is in contact with his daughter. This sentiment is one of the triggers for the 16 September incident – which occurred just three months before the date of this judgement. The Applicant’s unhappiness and concern will only increase when the Respondent and her fiancé live together after their marriage in December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is also evidence to suggest that the Applicant may have triggered the 2 June incident, created a scene, and threatened the Respondent with physical violence: see [13(b)] and [13(d)] above. The Police has completed their investigations into this incident and the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">26 September 2024 incident – Applicant allegedly assaulted the Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, and disturbingly, the Respondent has accused the Applicant of having committed yet another act of family violence just about two weeks before the hearing was due to start. According to her, the Applicant punched her face and kicked her leg in the evening of 26 September 2024. The alleged assault occurred when she was walking down her block of flats. After the assault, the Applicant allegedly told her that this was a “trial” and threatened to “whack” her again “soon”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> During the trial, the Respondent tendered photographs and a medical form to show that she had a bruise on her right chin and bruise/abrasion on her right thigh one day after the alleged assault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> According to the Respondent, police investigations into this incident are ongoing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Applicant strongly denied the Respondent’s allegations. While he admitted to being in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the material time (to exercise at an area downstairs), he denied meeting her. The Applicant submitted that her evidence should be disbelieved for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no witness to the alleged assault, despite it having occurred during “peak hour”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had made a police report about the assault only one day after the alleged incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the medical form, the Respondent “updated” that an e-scooter had also collided into her from the front.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Applicant submitted that the Respondent’s thigh injury is consistent with such a collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_d\"></a>(d)     One day after the alleged assault, there were text messages between the Respondent and the Applicant. She did not mention anything about the assault in those messages. During the hearing, the Applicant tendered the relevant messages to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Applicant was not arrested in connection with the alleged assault. The IO apparently told him that this was because the Police believed that he was innocent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I am not persuaded by the Applicant’s submissions. In my view, it is not appropriate for me to reject the Respondent’s allegation of the assault outright.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Regarding [37(a)] – The mere absence of eyewitnesses is equivocal and does not disprove the alleged assault. This fact is equally consistent with the possibility that the assault may have been <em>premediated</em> – i.e., the Applicant might have <em>chosen</em> a moment or a location to assault the Respondent away from public eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding [37(b)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       During her examination-in-chief, the Respondent had explained that soon after the alleged assault, she called the IO. The IO returned her call only <em>the next day.</em> He told her to lodge a police report and that he would follow-up thereafter. The Respondent promptly made the report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In any event, I am of the view there is no undue delay in the Respondent lodging the police report. The report was lodged just one day after the alleged assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Regarding [37(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Respondent, the collision was a minor one and had merely caused her to fall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, the Applicant’s submission fails to account for the undisputed bruise on the Respondent’s right chin. The Applicant conceded during cross-examination that such an injury is more consistent with it having been caused by a punch than an e-scooter collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Regarding [37(d)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is not correct to say that the Respondent had failed to mention anything in her text messages about the alleged assault one day after the incident. In one of these messages, the Respondent did ask the Applicant why he had transferred $316 to her, and whether it was “Doc fees for what u did”. The Respondent explained during the hearing that in this message, she was trying to clarify with the Applicant whether he had transferred the money to cover her medical expenses arising from the assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In his text message, the Applicant replied that the $136 was an “instalment” payment of the daughter’s maintenance. I find this reply to be puzzling. <em>First</em>, the Respondent testified that the Applicant had not paid maintenance by instalment before. The Applicant did not dispute this evidence. <em>Second</em>, it is strange why the Applicant chose to make an instalment payment of $136 – considering that the maintenance amount is $950. The Applicant did not explain how he had computed such an odd number for an instalment payment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Regarding [37(e)] – I do not give any weight to the opinion allegedly expressed by the IO. <em>First</em>, the IO’s identity is unknown. <em>Second</em>, the alleged opinion is inadmissible hearsay evidence. <em>Third</em>, the basis for the alleged opinion is unclear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In my view, there is basis to believe the Respondent’s evidence that the Applicant had punched her face: see [37(c)] above. That said, I decline to make an affirmative finding on this. The matter is still under investigations, and the Police has the resources to uncover the relevant evidence that can prove/disprove whether the alleged assault had indeed taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given the above, the Applicant has failed to prove his case that (a) the Respondent has “abused” the PPO and (b) there has been no recent incident of family violence: see [5] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is prudent for the PPO to remain in force. Minimally, it will remind the Applicant (a) to avoid high conflict situations with the Respondent and her son, and (b) not to use family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Accordingly, I dismiss SS 1031.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [10] to [16].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [17].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [17] and [18].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [28] and [32].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [21] and [22].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Respondent’s statement dated 11 October 2024 at page 1 (last paragraph) to page 2 (2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Exhibit R2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Call log is attached to the Respondent’s statement dated 11 October 2024 at pages 21 and 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [23] to [25] and pages 41 and 42;

They had four daughters. As to why the marriage had broken down, that is set out in some detail in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The SOP states that the Husband had been abusive towards the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 September 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 13 June 2024. Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After parties had filed their first set of affidavit of assets and means (“AOMs”), the Wife took out an application in SUM 3168/2024 (“SUM 3168”). She sought leave for her four daughters to file a joint affidavit. The purpose of this joint affidavit was to respond to a point which the Husband had made in his AOM. The Husband had, according to the Wife, falsely alleged that certain pieces of jewellery acquired during the marriage were all his financial contributions. On this basis, the Wife states that it was necessary for the four daughters to “affirm their respective knowledge about the gold jewel[l]eries” which she had purchased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 3168 came up for hearing before me. I reserved judgment after hearing arguments from both parties. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where a party to divorce proceeding seeks to file an affidavit by a third party, leave of the court must be sought. That was a point made clear in the recent decision of the Family Division of the High Court in <em>WWM v WWN and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> (“<em>WWM</em>”) at [4]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4     First, I agree with counsel for the Husband that the plain wording of rr 89(2) and 89(3) FJR provides for a total of two AM affidavits by each party and any further affidavits beyond the two require leave of court. Nothing in the wording of r 89 FJR supports the Wife’s interpretation for two rounds of affidavits. Second, had the Wife exhibited the Children’s Affidavits in her second affidavit, the court could have likewise expunged those exhibits. <b>I thus do not accept the Wife’s interpretation of r 89 FJR. The affidavits of means envisaged under that rule are intended to be those of the parties themselves. </b><b><u>Any others may be filed only with leave.</u></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>[</u>emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In deciding whether leave should be granted, a key consideration is the relevance and necessity of the affidavit of the third-party to the hearing of the ancillary matters hearing (see <em>WWM</em> (at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       To assess the relevance and necessity of the joint affidavit which the Wife is seeking leave to file, I take, as the starting point, what each party had set out in their first AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This was what the Husband had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Just and equitable division of the jewelleries in the possession of the Plaintiff and other household items removed from the flat. During one of my hospitalisations, the Plaintiff who was then briefly staying at my daughter’s place came over to remove all the jewelleries from the flat. These are jewelleries acquired during the marriage which were all my financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This was what the Wife had said in relation to the gold jewellery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I own other assets as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    I had received the sum of $43,000.00 being my Dependent Protection Sum monies from XX in December 2017…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    I purchased 916 gold jewellery items for the total value of $32,519.64 namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">3 necklace</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 chains (including 2 young children ones)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">6 pair bangles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bangle</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 pendants</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">5 adult rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">2 children rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 earrings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bracelet</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 chain with pendant</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 ring</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    all my said gold jewellery items are in the [Husband’s] possession as my 3 younger daughters and I left the matrimonial Flat in November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Based on what the Husband and the Wife had set out in their respective first AOMs, the relevance of the proposed joint affidavit cannot be seriously disputed. It deals with the issue of who had bought the jewellery, and whether that jewellery had indeed been taken from the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As to the necessity of the proposed joint affidavit, counsel for the Husband, Mr Arul Suppiah (“Mr Arul”), had, during the hearing, pointed out that the court hearing the ancillary matters was well placed to draw its own inferences from what had been set out in the affidavits that had been filed by both the Husband and the Wife. Following this line of logic, there was no need for the proposed joint affidavit to be filed. This was especially since the four daughters were already biased against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Counsel for the Wife, Ms Gurmeet Kaur (“Ms Kaur”), however, argued that the daughters’ evidence was needed to corroborate the Wife’s version of events – namely, that it was the Wife who had purchased the jewellery with her own money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to whether the daughters are indeed biased against the Husband, that is not a matter which can be decided at this juncture. That is for the judge hearing the ancillary matters to consider, in weighing up the evidence given by the four daughters in the proposed joint affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In my judgment, the proposed joint affidavit is indeed necessary in that it would cast light on whether it was the Husband or the Wife who had bought the jewellery, and the source of funds used to purchase the jewellery. The proposed joint affidavit may corroborate either the Husband or the Wife’s account as to how the jewellery was acquired, and whether the jewellery is still in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Leave is therefore granted to the Wife to file the proposed joint affidavit. That affidavit shall be filed by 19 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Parties shall write in, by way of letter to court, with their submissions on costs. The submissions shall not exceed 3 pages, and must be filed no later than 27 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here should be taken as binding the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It remains for me to thank Ms Kaur and Mr Arul for their able assistance.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-12-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2861 of 2023 (Summons No 2758 of 2024)","title":"XEH v XEI","citation":"[2024] SGFC 108","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32608-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Michael Han Hean Juan (Han & Lu Law Chambers LLP) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-12-14T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XEH v XEI</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEH <em>v</em> XEI </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32608-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 108</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2861 of 2023 (Summons No 2758 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 December 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Michael Han Hean Juan (Han &amp; Lu Law Chambers LLP) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XEH — XEI </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 2758/2024 (“SUM 2758”) which was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. I had earlier made orders in respect of SUM 2758: see <em>XEH v XEI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32433-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 93</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Han, argues that costs should be fixed at $2500 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife to the Husband. The reason for this is that the Husband, having succeeded in SUM 2758, was therefore entitled to costs. As to the quantum of such costs, Mr Han justifies the sum the Husband is seeking on the basis of the work done for SUM 2758.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In addition, Mr Han also refers to the State Court Practice Directions 2021 Appendix H: <em>Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards in District Court Cases in the State Courts of Singapore</em> to show that the quantum of $2500 was not a wholly unreasonable sum to seek.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife, on the other hand, filed her submissions on costs late in the day. I had directed parties to file their submissions on costs by 25 October 2024. On 1 November 2024, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Wife, informing her that these submissions on costs were to be filed by 8 November 2024, failing which, the court would proceed to make costs orders in respect of SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 November 2024, the Wife sent an email to the Family Court Registry enclosing a number of documents. This appeared to be an attempt to comply with the orders I had made in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Also contained in that email was the Wife’s written submissions on the costs of SUM 2758. In those set of submissions, the Wife argues that she should not have to pay costs of $2500 to the Husband. She gives two reasons. First, that the Husband had filed his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories late.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Second, that the Husband had, in taking out SUM 2758, caused further delays in the hearing of the ancillary matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Where costs are concerned, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event – in other words, the successful party is entitled to costs. The court, however, can depart from this starting point: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the present case, the Husband is the successful party in that he had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items he had sought in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       He is therefore entitled to costs. I see no reason to depart from the starting point that costs shall follow the event. While it is true that the Husband had only served his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories 13 days after the deadline set by the court, this was, in my judgment, not such a lengthy delay which justified departing from the starting point that costs shall follow the event: see Rule 852 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $1600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of costs, I considered the number of items sought as well as the fact that SUM 2758 did not involve any novel points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In particular, I took into account the Wife’s conduct. I note from the minutes of the previous case conferences<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that the Wife had told the court that she was not going to respond to any voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories that the Husband might serve on her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She had also told the court that she would not file a reply affidavit to SUM 2758 because it was a “waste of time” and that she had neither the time nor the energy to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The voluntary disclosure regime in the context of discovery and interrogatories provides parties the opportunity to ask for documents and information that may have a bearing on the issues in dispute without having to take out a formal application to court. This, of course, can only work if the party on whom the voluntary request is served takes a sensible approach, and does not unreasonably object, or refuse to provide documents sought or give responses to interrogatories. If that party chooses to not respond to the voluntary request, they must then accept that the requesting party is then entitled to, as a matter of procedure, take out the relevant application: see Rule 63(4) FJR 2014. This would, naturally, result in a delay to the hearing of the ancillary matters whilst the application for discovery and/or interrogatories is heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Had the Wife made an attempt to respond to the Husband’s voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, there may not have been a need for SUM 2758, or that the items sought in SUM 2758 could have been reduced. She chose to not engage with the Husband’s voluntary request, or his application in SUM 2758 (see above at [10]).

I heard the parties and granted the Father’s application. The Mother appeals against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child’s Mother is the Plaintiff, and the child’s Father is the Defendant in the principal case, which was a divorce proceeding. The parents had married in June 2011 in Norway. At all material times, the Mother is a Singaporean and the Father a Norwegian. They lived in Norway for a few years and then moved to Singapore. Their relationship broke down, and by consent, they were divorced by an interim judgment in May 2017. The ancillary issues were not agreed upon. I heard and decided the ancillary issues in December 2018. The relevant part of my order stated as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The parents shall have Joint Custody of the child with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father shall have access as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Every Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekday access”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Every Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekend Access”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    From 1 June 2019, the Weekday access shall remain or adjusted to different days if agreed to by parties, or else shall remain the same; and weekend access shall be on alternate weekends Saturday 10 a.m. overnight to Sunday 2 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father is permitted to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from 2019. The Defendant shall ensure that the child is returned to Singapore to the Plaintiff no later than 30 December immediately thereafter. The Plaintiff shall release the child’s passport to the Defendant for this purpose. The Plaintiff shall also furnish the passport details of the child to the Defendant to enable travel arrangements to be made. The Defendant shall furnish the details of the visit including the travel documents and the addresses where the child shall be at to the Plaintiff in exchange for the child’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother appealed against my whole decision. Her appeal was heard in December 2019. The appeal was heard by the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon who made the following orders on the issue of the child (“the Order”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1</em>.     <em>Custody, care and control</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For the avoidance of doubt, as ordered by the District Judge in FC/ORC 1115/2019, the parties shall have Joint Custody of the child of the marriage, B (&quot;the Child&quot;), with care and control to the Plaintiff/Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>2</em>.     <em>Access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The orders of the District Judge for access in FC/ORC 1115/2019 are upheld, save as shown to be varied below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>.     <em>Weekday access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30 pm to 8.45 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>.     <em>Weekend access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child on alternative weekends from 10.00 am on Saturdays to 2.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>c</em>.     <em>Overseas access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall be permitted to bring the Child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall ensure that the Child is returned to the Plaintiff/Mother in Singapore no later than 30th day of that December immediately after the temporary visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother is to keep the Child’s passport and maintain its validity for travels. She shall furnish the details of the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father to enable travel arrangements to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall furnish to the Plaintiff/Mother the details of the visits, including the travel documents and the addresses of places where the Child will be at no later than 21 days before the trip, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall release the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father no later than 7 days before the trip.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Child’s passport shall be handed back to the Plaintiff/Mother together with the Child after the visits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother shall inform the Defendant/Father whenever the Child travels overseas before such trips. Save for travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father this information no later than 21 days before the trips. For travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the information shall be provided to the Defendant/Father once the trip is confirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>d</em>.     <em>Increase in length of overnight access sessions</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Parties are to endeavour to agree on having overnight access sessions for the Defendant/Father of longer durations, in particular during the Child’s school holidays, between now and December 2020. In the event that there is no agreement by the end of January 2020, either party may file an application to the Family Court to formalise the arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>e</em>.     <em>Pick-up point</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">For the access, the Defendant/Father shall pick-up and return the Child to the condominium where the Child resides, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father an access card key to the entrance of the condominium to facilitate the pick-up and return of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father had access to the child from after December 2018 when I made my order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In August 2022, due to an altercation between the Father and the Mother regarding access, both parents filed applications for personal protections orders against each other. In the course of those proceedings, the Father agreed to undergo a POTS (Panel of Therapeutic Specialists) programme, but the Mother did not agree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before the protection cases were concluded, however, in November 2022 the Mother filed an application to vary the Order. She did not seek to disturb the orders on custody care and control of the Child, but she sought changes regarding access, as well as to remove a penal notice that had been attached to it. The Father objected to these requests and filed a cross application to vary the care and control of the Child to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 7 December 2022, after 3 days of hearing, the learned District Judge Amy Tung dismissed both the protection applications by the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother’s and Father’s variation applications were then heard by me in May 2023. I heard the parents. I interviewed the Child. In July 2023, I dismissed both applications. The Mother appealed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Pending the hearing of the appeal, in August 2023, the Father applied for 2 weeks of additional access during the end-of-year school holidays in lieu of more than 117 breaches of access, and for the Mother to produce the Child’s passport and personal documents for 15 days of overseas travel as provided for in the Order. Again, I heard both parties and I interviewed the Child. I dismissed the Father’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 27 October 2023, the Father filed the present application for an order of committal against the Mother.

She explains that on a few occasions the Child was unwell, or had contracted COVID, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022. During 28 February – 19 March 2023 the Child was in India with her, and so the Father could not have had access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the rest of the occasions, her position is simply that the Child did not want to see the Father nor to spend overnight with him, and she could not force the Child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother confirms that the Child loved the Father. She claims that the Child has not gotten used to overnight access with the Father, and he still complains about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     She says that the Child is a seeing a counsellor to help him handle his feelings. She adduces a copy of a report by the counsellor. The report shows that the counsellor arrived at some conclusions without having interviewed the Father. I find that this examination of the Child had been conducted without leave of the Court as required under Rule 35 of the Family Justice Rules:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Examination of child with leave of Court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35.—(1)    Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action or proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I therefore placed no reliance on its contents. In any event, the examination of the child was conducted not only without leave of the Court, but without notice to the Father or with his involvement. In any event, I find that the report is of no probative value to the issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I find that of the 117 occasions of breach alleged by the Father, 4 of them took place because the Child was ill, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022, and on 20 October 2022. I find that on those occasions, the Mother had reasonable cause to refuse the access, and therefore she did not breach the Order on those occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Of the remaining 113, the Father had partial access albeit not strictly according to the terms of the Order, on 9 &amp; 18 August 2022, 22 October 2022, 10 &amp; 22 November 2022, and 22 January 2023. I give the benefit of these partial compliances to the Mother, and therefore find that for those occasions she is not liable to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As for the remaining 107 times when the Father did not get access to the Child, I find that the Mother has no reasonable excuse. I do not accept that the blame lays with the Child. It is not disputed that there were no issues with access until suddenly in August 2022. This was when the Mother and the Father had an altercation that resulted in the PPO applications. The circumstances of that altercation was itself caused by the Mother’s refusal to give the Father access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Mother’s defence, that the Child does not want to spend overnight with the Father, does not explain the lack of weekday access that did not include overnighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In cases of access, occasional defaults due to reasons such as scheduling issues is understandable, but the sheer number of times that the access was not given in the present case show that this could not have been the case here. The extended and continuous length of the non-compliance over a period of a year displaces such reasonable excuses. It is irresistible to conclude that the non-compliance was nothing other than intentional and deliberate. I am not convinced that it is solely because the Child refused to see the Father. Throughout the trial, there was little before me to say why the Child would refuse to see his father. More stark is the fact that the Mother did not take steps to address the Child’s alleged reluctance. Even if I were to accept that there was reluctance on the part of the Child, the Mother had refused to have the issue referred to a therapist under the POTS scheme when the opportunity arose during the PPO proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I find it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, that the Mother is guilty of contempt of court in that she did not comply with the Order in a total of 107 times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Mitigation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In mitigation, the Mother’s learned counsel argues that the Child had indicated to the Mother that he did not wish to go for the overnight and overseas access, and that it was not possible to force the Child to go for the access against his wishes. She argues that the Child was no longer small enough to be carried off to access against his will. Therefore, Counsel argues, the Mother had done all that was needed on her part. The Child is of age that he is able to speak what he wants. She argues that as such, the Mother should not be penalised. She suggested that counselling to be ordered so her client can attend instead of committing her for the breaches. Alternatively, she asked for any committal order to be suspended, for the parents to attend counselling on how to deal with the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Father, who represents himself, argues that the breaches were significant. The Mother has not shown any remorse or take responsibility. She has had opportunities to address the issue. The Father agrees to a suspension of committal, but he says he believes that things will not change unless there is a significant risk imposed on the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I note that provision for punishment for contempt of court is found in the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016, in particular, in subsection 12 (c):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Punishment for contempt of court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“12.—(1</em>)     <em>Except as otherwise provided in any other written law, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished —</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the General Division of the High Court in relation to contempt in the face of or in connection with any proceedings in a State Court, Family Court or Youth Court (as the case may be), with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by any other court, with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I take into account that this is the first time that the Mother is guilty of contempt. I take into account that she does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I also take into account that she contested the case against her. I take into account that she does not contest that the Father had not had access to the Child for a year preceding his application. I take into account that the Mother committed these breaches even after her application to vary the terms of access had been dismissed by me, and also by the High Court. I take into account that if indeed the Child was unwilling to see the Father for reasons beyond her control, the Mother had refused to address the issue by accepting therapy under the POTS scheme. These factors weigh against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is in the best interest of every child to have relationships with both parents. Relationships can only be built upon a strong foundation of contact and time spent together. Access orders are issued to meet this goal. It follows that such orders must be carried out. It is the basic duty of parents to ensure that access arrangements are followed through, to and come to mutual adjustments to deal with issues when they arise, but always with the intent to ensure that access is provided, so that the child has full space and time to build and maintain a relationship with the access parent. When there is a difficulty in complying, then it is a parental duty to address it. The Mother had failed to meet this duty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that it is fair and just that the Mother be fined $8,000.00 which is to be paid within 1 month, in default of which she be imprisoned for 4 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I find it appropriate and just to I suspend this Committal Order provided the Mother does not commit any further breach of the 3 December 2019 Order of Court for a period of 1 year. If she fails to comply with the terms on which this Committal Order is suspended, the Father shall be at liberty to apply inter partes to the Court to consider whether the Committal Order should be enforced or discharged [<em>Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0870.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 870</a></em>].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I urge the Mother to come to arrangements with the Father and with the Child to undergo therapy to address the access issues. With sincerity and effort, I hope the Child will enjoy a happy and positive relationship with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On costs, the Mother says that she is not able to pay any costs. She had not paid costs for the appeal. She does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father argues that the case had been going on 12 months. He had to serve a penal notice, file a leave application, filed 3 affidavits, attend case conferences, and several hearings.

I had earlier given my decision and made orders for discovery: <em>XEF v XEG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 92</a> (“<em>XEF</em>”). This is my decision on the costs of SUM 2244.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Michael Chang (“Mr Chang”) argues that the Husband should be entitled to costs fixed at $2000 (all-in). Mr Chang makes the point that the Wife had: <b>a)</b> consistently refused to disclose her documents throughout the proceedings, <b>b)</b> refused to comply with the court’s directions. This had all resulted in the wastage of resources and caused undue delay which should be reflected in the award of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Wife, Ms Samantha Ee (“Ms Ee”), on the other hand, argues that no costs should be awarded. She gives two reasons. First, the Husband was not successful in his application and the Wife had already been prejudiced by the delay in the proceedings occasioned by the Husband’s actions. Second, that the need to minimise acrimony between the parties weighs in favour of making no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As a starting point, costs follow the event, though the court can, in the exercise of its discretion, depart from this starting point: see <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. One other point which bears noting is that while the Husband is legally-aided, in my assessment of costs, he is not to be treated differently from a litigant who is not legally-aided: see s 16(1) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, the Husband had only succeeded in obtaining orders in respect of two out of the four items sought in discovery. While he could not be said to have succeeded in his application, he is, in my judgment, still entitled to costs on the basis that these documents could have, and should have, been disclosed when he had made his voluntary request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In this connection, it is apparent to me that the Wife does not have any good reasons for failing to disclose the documents sought at the voluntary stage. The Wife explains that she redacted certain transactions in her bank statement because she was concerned that the Husband would engage in an exercise in forensic accounting to make her account for every dollar that had been spent and that this would only serve to further protract matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This is not a good reason for refusing to disclose the unredacted bank statement. The law is clear that the court will not be inclined to grant orders for discovery or interrogatories where the applicant clearly wants these documents to make the other party account for every single transaction: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [14] – [15]; <em>XDD v XDE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32212-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 79</a> at [9] – [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In relation to the Wife’s IRAS Notice of Assessment (“NOA”), the Wife claims that she did not intend to employ a “tit-for-tat” approach in stating that she would only disclose her IRAS statements if the Husband provided his latest IRAS NOA as well. She says that she was troubled by the Husband’s refusal to exchange his IRAS NOA even when she had suggested that both parties exchange their respective IRAS NOAs. She suggests that this demonstrates that the Husband would not provide his IRAS NOA even if she had issued a “formal request for discovery”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife’s decision to not disclose these documents appears to be a purely strategic one calculated at, hopefully, expediting proceedings by reducing opportunities for the Husband to file further summons for discovery or interrogatories. What the Wife had left out of the equation was the additional time that would be incurred if the Husband had to file his own summons to compel her to disclose documents which she could have produced in the first place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In that vein, the Wife also points the finger at the Husband for filing SUM 2244 so late in the day. She says that by doing so, he had prolonged matters by more than six months (from April to October 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     This is not an entirely fair characterisation of what had transpired. I note from the minutes of the case conference on 20 June 2024 that the court had granted the Wife an extension of time of 1 week to provide her voluntary disclosure. Had the Wife provided the documents sought, that might have been the end of the matter and timelines could have possibly been brought forwards by three months at the very least.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although Ms Ee rightly points out that the court may make no order as to costs to minimise acrimony between the parties, the Wife’s conduct in this matter must also be taken into account. First, as I have noted, the Wife had a role in prolonging matters as the documents which the Husband had obtained orders for discovery could have been disclosed earlier. This was certainly not conducive to reducing acrimony between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Second, there is also the position which the Wife had taken at the hearing of SUM 2244. She had argued that the Husband could have avoided the need to ask for the Wife’s NOA in discovery had he agreed to her “reasonable proposal” to exchange the documents on a mutual basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This was, as I had noted in my judgment (<em>XEF</em> at [14]), not a basis on which disclosure could be resisted. In any event, the better approach, which the Wife could have taken, was to disclose her NOA, and to ask the Husband for the same if she thought that the Husband’s NOA was also relevant to the issues in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In short, the Wife could have taken a course of action which would minimise or eliminate further avenues for conflict. She did not seize that opportunity. Given this, I did not think it open to her to now argue that no order of costs should be made in the interests of reducing or minimising acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the circumstances, I find that the Wife should have to pay costs for SUM 2244. Taking into account the factors I have highlighted above, these costs are fixed at $1100 (all-in). Parties are in agreement that these costs should be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. I therefore order that the Wife pay this sum of $1100 to the Director of Legal Aid. This is to be done by 31 December 2024.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Variation of Ancillary Matters Orders – Maintenance"],"date":"2024-11-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3897 of 2013","title":"XFU v XFV","citation":"[2024] SGFC 104","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32491-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Mohamed Fazal bin Abdul Hamid & Mr Muhammad Aadil bin Dafir (I.R.B.

The defendant mother (“the Mother”) disagreed to the variation sought by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father and Mother (“the Parties”) were married in December 2004 and have three children, S, a girl, who was born in 2007 (“S”), M, a boy, who was born in 2009 (“M”) and R, a boy, who was born in 2012 (“R”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In August 2013, the Father commenced divorce proceedings citing the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The Interim Judgment was granted, on an uncontested basis, in April 2014 with the ancillary matters adjourned to be heard in chambers. The court delivered its final orders in respect of the ancillary matters on 5 August 2015 (“the 2015 Order”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The orders in respect of maintenance for the S, M and R (“the children”), which was the central issue before me in the current application, read as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>a)     The Father shall pay the Mother monthly maintenance of $6,000 for the maintenance of the Mother and three children, namely S, M and R, for 18 months beginning 31 August 2015 and thereafter on the last day of each month until the last day of January 2017;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>b)     Commencing 28 February 2017, the Father shall pay the Mother (i) monthly maintenance of $4,000 for the maintenance of their three children and (ii) nominal maintenance of $1 per month for the Mother’s maintenance;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The 2015 Order essentially fixed maintenance at the initial sum of $6,000 per month, which decreased to $4,000 per month in 2017; this mechanism was in-built into the 2015 Order. The Final Judgment was issued on 14 August 2015. The Father remarried in 2016 and has two children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> from his current marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The current application for variation of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father filed the current application to vary the children’s maintenance under the 2015 Order in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>a)     Maintenance of $4,000 be temporarily varied to $0 and backdated from 1 Jan 2023 until such time the Father obtains new employment paying him at least S$15,000.00 each month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>b)     Further and/or in the alternative in the event the Father obtains new employment paying him at least S$8,000.00 each month, the Father shall pay the Mother monthly maintenance of S$1,200.00 for the maintenance of their three children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Parties subsequently attended mediation to amicably resolve the variation application; their efforts, however, were unsuccessful. The variation application thereafter came up before me for a hearing, at which both parties were represented by counsel. On 22 August 2024, I delivered my decision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, allowing the Father’s application and varying the children’s maintenance downwards, but not to the extent sought by the Father.

In fact, for five out of the last eight years, the Father earned between $205,000 and $243,000 per year. I also noted Father’s evidence indicating that he had significant work experience<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. For all these reasons, I did not consider his income of $76,375, in the Year of Assessment 2024, reflective of his true income or earning capacity, and was confident that he would find suitable employment in short order. In this regard, I also noted that while he was unemployed from 1 January 2023 to 31 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>, he eventually found employment; there was nothing to suggest that the same would not happen now.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the Mother’s income, I noted that she received monthly rental income from renting out rooms in her flat.

According to the Mother, she was unable to find employment due to the children’s needs. On the other hand, the Father contended that this was just a façade to apportion more financial responsibility to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. I noted the Mother’s concerns over the children’s health challenges; however, they were not reasons, <em>in and of themselves</em>, not to find employment <em>at all</em>. The Mother must make meaningful efforts which result in her employment. That being said, I could only rely on the parties’ recent income and expenses in making orders in the current application. In my view, it would be incorrect to <em>lower</em> the Father’s current contributions to the children’s maintenance by <em>guessing</em> the Mother’s future income; the children’s expenses remained the joint responsibility of both parents and they must both try harder for the sake of their children. The Father’s “squeezing water from stone<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>” argument, therefore, cut both ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Based on the children’s total current reasonable expenses of $4,076, the Father’s 86% contribution was therefore about $3,500<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>. This was how I arrived at the sum of $3,500 as the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Finally, the Father also asked me to consider his remarriage and two children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> from his current marriage as a factor. My view was this: it was incorrect for the Father to assert that he could not afford to pay reasonable maintenance for the children when he had <em>voluntarily</em> taken on additional financial obligations for his new family; the decision to take on any additional financial obligations must have regard to the existing ones - I therefore trust that the Father could afford to do both. I was accordingly unable to place much weight on this factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Commencement date of the new maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As the Father’s application to lower the children’s maintenance was filed on 26 June 2023, I considered it appropriate to order that the new maintenance amount take effect on this date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Based on the evidence and for the reasons stated above, I was satisfied that the Father had met the burden of proving that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 2015 Order warranting a downward variation of the children’s monthly maintenance, and I made orders accordingly. After hearing parties on costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       On 7 May 2024, the Mother filed an application to enforce the maintenance order made in respect of the child of the marriage in FC/IJ xx/2019. The matter came before me for hearing on 3 September 2024 and after hearing from the parties, I allowed the Mother’s application and determined that arrears amounted to a sum of $4,711 as at 3 September 2024. I then ordered that the respondent father (“Father”) pay this amount in 2 instalments on 1 October 2024 and 1 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father has filed an appeal against my decision, and I set forth below the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties in this case had filed for divorce in November 2015. Interim Judgement was granted on 7 March 2019 and various consent orders were recorded at the same time. These included orders granting joint custody of the then 3-year-old child of the marriage to both parents with sole care and control of the child to the Mother as well as orders relating to the child maintenance that was to be paid by the Father to the Mother. In relation to the maintenance for the child, the orders provided as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“MAINTENANCE FOR THE CHILD</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">j.     <em><u>Monthly maintenance payments</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>For the month of February 2019, the Defendant shall pay maintenance of $2,314, which shall be deposited directly into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account by 8 February 2019 (Friday).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>k</em>.     <em>Thereafter, the Defendant shall pay maintenance of $3,350 per month, which shall be deposited via GIRO or standing instructions into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account by 1 March 2019 and thereafter on or before the 1st day of each subsequent month, regardless of whether the 1st day of the month falls on a weekday or a weekend day.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>l</em>.     <em>For avoidance of doubt, the sum of $3,350 at sub­paragraph (k) above comprises $1,807.85 being the child’s monthly school fees at LV for 2019 and $1,542.15 being the Defendant’s contribution towards the child’s share of household and maid expenses, and the child’s personal expenses excluding those items specifically mentioned below. In the event the school fees at LV increase beyond $1,807.85, the Defendant shall bear 60% of the increase and this amount shall be added to the Defendant’s monthly maintenance payments accordingly (i.e. if the child’s school fees increase from $1,807.85 to $1,907.85 per month, the Defendant shall add $60 to his monthly maintenance payments).”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above orders relating to child maintenance also went on to list other items of the child’s expenses including health insurance, medical and medication, dental costs, international school fees, transportation to and from international school etc and specified that these would be shared equally between the parties (“Original Maintenance Order”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Five (5) years have passed since the consent orders were recorded and the child is now 8 years of age. While there have been formal applications to vary the orders relating to some of the child issues, to date, no applications have been made to vary the Original Maintenance Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law and issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother’s application for enforcement of child maintenance was filed under section 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”) which provides that where a maintenance order has been made under section 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”), and the person ordered to pay maintenance has failed to make one or more payments required, an application may be made for the court to enforce the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In determining whether to make an enforcement order, it is necessary for the following issues to be considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Father has failed to pay maintenance in accordance with the terms of the prevailing maintenance order and, if so what is the amount in arrears;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where it has been determined that maintenance payments are in arrears, whether the Father has explained i.e. “shown cause” as to why he has not complied with the maintenance order; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Depending on whether the Father has “shown cause”, what is the appropriate enforcement order to be made having regard to the circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Where the parties mutually agree to vary the terms of a maintenance order, the courts have accepted that this should be considered even where no formal application to vary the court order has been made. In <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> the Court found on the evidence that the Complainant had agreed to the Respondent’s request for a reduction of maintenance for a period of time due to his financial difficulty. Although there was no court ordered variation, taking into consideration the agreement mutually reached by the parties, the District Court accepted that the arrears which had accrued during that period of time where parties agreed to the payment of a lower amount of maintenance, should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother claimed maintenance arrears of $4,711. It was her position that although the Original Maintenance Order had provided for child maintenance of $3,350 per month, the parties had sometime in October 2022 when the child was changing schools reached agreement for the child’s maintenance to be varied to an amount of $2,485 per month excluding school fees which was to be shared by the parties equally outside of this amount. Accordingly, she was only looking to enforce the maintenance arrears in relation to this amount. She informed the court that since October 2022, the Father had paid this agreed amount of $2,485 per month to her and had only stopped paying this amount in May 2024.

He also did not dispute the fact that he had paid this monthly sum of $2,845 to the Mother as the child’s expenses from October 2022 to May 2024, a period of 18 months. His position was that he had misinterpreted and miscalculated the child maintenance amount set out in the Original Maintenance Order when he had written to the Mother in October 2022. It was his position that the amount of $3,350 per month had included the child’s kindergarten school fees of $1,807.85 and since the child’s school fees were now being paid separately by the parties in equal shares, based on the Original Maintenance Order, the balance amount of $1,542.15 should be what he should have been paying as child maintenance. He explained that he had only recently realised that he had been overpaying all this time and accordingly, since May 2024, he has started paying the amount of $1,543 to the Mother as child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent argued that under section 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”), the court is only empowered to enforce a court ordered maintenance order and since no order had been recorded when the parties had varied the child maintenance amount from $3,350 per month to $2,485 per month, the Complainant should not be allowed to bring an enforcement application against him in reliance of a mutual agreement as this had not been officially recorded as a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the respondent has failed to pay maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Original Maintenance Orders had provided that the monthly child maintenance was $3,350 and clarified that this comprised of $1,807.85 being the child’s monthly school fees at the time and $1,542.15 being the Father’s contribution towards the child’s expenses which included household expenses, maid expenses as well as the child’s personal expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Original Maintenance Order also detailed how other expenses were to be shared between the parties and this included international school fees and charges which were to be borne by the parties equally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In October 2022 parties exchanged emails discussing various amounts and expenses that had been incurred for the child as well as on the issue of school fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. On 13 October 2022, the Father wrote to the Mother by email and stated in the third paragraph under the heading of “School Fees” as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“LV October: The calculation is wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">According to the agreement, we both pay SGD 1,807.85.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">LV increased the fee to SGD 1,870, there is a difference of SGD 63.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Of those SGD 63, I contribute 60% and you 40%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That means that my contribution is: SGD 37.80 (60% of the increment) + SGD 903.925 (50% of LV) – SGD 941.725.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">October fee for LV was: SGD 1000.45/2: SGD 500.225 (each).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It would appear from the above that the Father had acknowledged that there had been an error in the Original Maintenance Order where the school fees for the child’s kindergarten appears to have been a total of $1,807.85 but that his share of the school fees should have only been $941.725.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I noted further that in that same email, under the heading of “Child maintenance moving forward”, the Father went on to state as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“Current Maintenance (CM) is: SGD 3,427 – LV SGD 951.70 = SGD 2,485.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Taking into consideration the above, I determined that the parties had agreed that there had been a miscalculation in the Original Maintenance Order and this email exchange sought to correct that error.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Following the email exchange referred to above, the parties operated on the premise that an agreement had been reached to vary the child maintenance from $3,350 to $2,485. This was evidenced by the fact that the Father paid to the Mother a sum of $2,485 per month as child maintenance for a period 18 months from October 2022 to April 2024. The Father did not dispute that there had been an agreement between the parties to vary the Original Maintenance Order nor did he dispute that he had made the payments during the abovementioned period. It was also not disputed that the above amounts excluded the child’s school fees which had been paid by the parties in equal shares separately. Accordingly, I accepted that parties had mutually agreed that the child maintenance would be reduced to a sum of $2,485 (excluding school fees). Additionally, even though no formal application had been made to vary the Original Maintenance Order, since October 2022 the parties had operated on the basis that the current applicable child maintenance amount was $2,845.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father argued that in enforcement proceedings, the court can only enforce a recorded order of court. I did not agree with this as this would clearly lead to an overly technical and unjust result. It should be noted that the courts have in various circumstances recognised agreements reached by the parties in the context of considering if a respondent in a suit had shown sufficient cause not to have certain amounts of arrears enforced against him (see <em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, at [21]; <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a>, at [20] – [22] ) and have allowed reliance on such a mutual agreement. There would be no good reason why a complainant should likewise not be allowed to rely on such a mutual agreement arrived at between the parties especially since the parties had both operated on the basis of this mutual agreement over a prolonged period of time. Accordingly, I considered the Original Maintenance Order but took into consideration the subsequent mutual agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother explained that she had not sought to bring a formal application to court to vary the consent order previously recorded as her understanding was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Because it was, .. … we were able to agree with the Respondent and that’s why we have it written on email with the corrected breakdown and as established practice for 2 years. ….. my understanding is that….. with the Respondent we can agree on something without needing to go through the Court. ……. It’s accepted.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I wholeheartedly agreed with the Mother. In line with the philosophy of Therapeutic Justice (“TJ”) adopted by the Family Justice Courts on 21 October 2024, a key objective of TJ is to encourage parties to move forward, enabled and equipped to resolve any future disagreements. Not enforcing what the parties had mutually agreed to and operated on, would go against the essence of the philosophy of TJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In light of the above, I arrived at the conclusion that the relevant amount of monthly child maintenance that should be paid by the Father to the Mother was $2,485 and as it was not disputed that the Father had from May 2024 to September 2024 only paid a sum $1,543 per month save that in June 2024, he paid a sum of $1,542, I determined that he had failed to pay the full amount of child maintenance which he was obligated to pay and that the arrears of child maintenance totalled a sum of $4,711.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father has shown cause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The question to be determined is whether the Father had provided good reason why he had not paid the arrears of child maintenance i.e. shown cause. Apart from maintaining that he had been mistaken in his calculations and should have followed what had been stated in the Original Maintenance Order strictly (which has already been addressed above), the Father brought no other evidence and provided no other explanation as to why he had not paid the agreed maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the issue of his mistake, I would note that based on the evidence before me, it was clear that the Father had spotted the mistake in the Original Maintenance Order in October 2022 and had taken steps to rectify the calculations which had thereafter been mutually agreed upon. After operating in this manner for 18 months and with the Mother having relied on this for the same period, I did not think that he should now be allowed to renege on his position and argue that he had misunderstood the Original Maintenance Order. In the circumstances, I did not find that he had provided good reason to explain why he had not paid the maintenance arrears of $4,711.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">What is the appropriate enforcement order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     During the trial, the Father indicated that he currently worked part time in the advertising industry and earned a net salary of $5,200. His expenses totalled an amount above $6,000 including a sum of $1,543 per month for the child’s maintenance. He admitted during cross-examination that he had previously been a creative director of a big advertising agency and had at some point in his career earned a salary of more than $200,000 per annum without bonus and benefits. This was borne out by his Notice of Assessment for 2022 to 2024<sup>4</sup>, where he earned an average annual income of $231,896. The Father provided no explanation as to why he had left his previous advertising jobs to take on a part time role where he earned roughly a quarter of what he had previously earned. In addition, he admitted that he had a savings plan life insurance with more than $4,000 in that account. Taking into consideration all of the evidence before me, I determined that it would be appropriate for the Father to pay the arrears of $4,711 in two (2) instalments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The court’s participation and intervention is required where parties are unable to see eye to eye and to reach agreement on their own. Notwithstanding, especially in line with the philosophy of TJ, parties are encouraged to learn to work together as co-parents and to resolve issues between themselves without having to come to court on every occasion.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>FC/IJ xx/2019, paragraph 3(l)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>FC/IJ xx/2019, paragraph 3(m) and (n)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Complainant bundle of documents marked as C1 on page 20 and 21</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript of proceedings on Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2024 on page 10 of 39, lines 16 to 21</p></div></content></root>"}]
