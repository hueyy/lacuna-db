My decision in respect of SUM 3441 can be found in <em>XHU v ZHV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32826-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 11</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that the Husband should have to pay the Wife costs, fixed at $2000 (all-in). They say that the Husband’s application in SUM 3441 was unmeritorious and had “unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of” the divorce proceedings. They also emphasise that the Husband had not pursued his discovery request in good faith.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband, on the other hand, after having been reminded to put in his submissions on the costs of SUM 3441, stated that he did “not have any cost to claim”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event, though the court can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27020-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 1</a> at [9] and [10] citing Rule 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32251-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 84</a> at [4] citing <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, the Wife is entitled to costs. That is because she had successfully resisted the Husband’s application for discovery in SUM 3441. The Husband did not manage to obtain the orders which he sought in SUM 3441.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of such costs, I take into account the fact that the Husband had only sought discovery in respect of two items, and that the affidavits and submissions were not particularly voluminous. While counsel for the Wife argues that his application was unmeritorious and that it was not taken out in good faith, they have not set out why this is the case, apart from pointing to the fact that this is evident from the Husband’s “haphazard application and pleadings”. In any event, I do not find that the Husband’s conduct warrants an upwards adjustment in the quantum of such costs to be awarded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is therefore ordered that the Husband shall pay the Wife the sum of $600, being the costs of SUM 3441.

In light of the issues raised by parties with respect to [T], I called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) and reserved my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Having received the CER, I fixed the matter for decision on 27 December 2024, which was re-fixed to 13 January 2025 at parties’ request. Shortly before the date of decision, the Wife’s counsel wrote a letter dated 2 January 2025 to the court to “highlight the Plaintiff’s ongoing and hostile conduct”. This invited a reply dated 8 January 2025 from the Husband refuting the Wife’s allegations as “a blatant attempt to mislead the court”. The Wife responded with a rebuttal dated 10 January 2025 “to address the Plaintiff’s numerous misleading and unsubstantiated allegations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the resumed hearing on 13 January 2025, I reminded counsel that when the court had reserved judgment as I had done in this case, no new evidence should be presented without the leave of court: see <em>VYP v VYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26994-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 40</a> (at [36]). I also reminded counsel that it was a discourtesy to the court to make further submission without seeking leave: see <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a> (at [9]). As these letters were presented to the court after judgment was reserved, I made it clear that I did not consider the contents of the letters in reaching my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When giving my decision, I provided brief grounds to parties and indicated that these might be elaborated on and supplemented with fuller grounds if required. As the Wife has appealed the whole of my decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 8/2025 filed on 24 January 2025, I set out below my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I begin with the Wife’s application to “set aside/vary” the Consent Order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. The starting point is s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), which provides that the court “may, at any time, it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband submitted that the Wife’s application was confusing as it was not entirely clear if the Wife was trying to set aside the Consent Order or vary the Consent Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I agreed that clarity was important as the thresholds for setting aside and varying a consent order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets are different. Moreover, the Wife’s application went beyond the division of matrimonial assets. It extended to the setting aside and variation of orders in relation to custody, care and control and child maintenance, for which different provisions and considerations apply. Yet, the entirety of the Wife’s submissions was premised on s 112(4) of the Charter, which is applicable only to the division of matrimonial assets. This was unsatisfactory as it obfuscated the issues that had to be determined by the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the deficiency in the Wife’s submissions, I gave careful consideration to the merits of her application in accordance with the applicable provisions and relevant case law with respect to each area of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be set aside</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The threshold for setting aside a consent order relating to the division of matrimonial assets was set out in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Chew Koon</em> [2005] 1 SLR (R) 548 (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”) and discussed in <em>AOO v AON</em> [2011] 4 SLR1169 (at [10]) and <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM v AYL</em>”) (at [17]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [6]), “[a] court would interfere with an order of court obtained by consent, only on just and equitable grounds”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Choo Han Teck J explained (at [5]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court “may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”. But this section, and the authorities referred to by Mr Chia, should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in <em>Dean v Dean</em> [1978] 3 All ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[W]here an agreement between the parties had been reached at arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would probably be unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Hence, to set aside a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(4) of the Charter, an applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors: see <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a> (at [8]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> A vitiating factor is a contractual doctrine that includes misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence, duress, unconscionability, as well as illegality and public policy: see <em>TR v TQ</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) (at [97]). While the precise application of each of the vitiating factors to consent orders made in the matrimonial context has not been definitively decided (see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15])), some of the reasons that have been cited in setting-aside applications include duress, misrepresentation and undue influence: for example, see <em>UMM v UML</em> and <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> (“<em>ATZ v AUA</em>”) (at [22]). In addition, the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties may also result in a consent order being set aside: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [31]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In the present case, the Wife claimed that the Consent Order was obtained through “duress, undue influence and misrepresentation” which severely compromised her ability to make a free and informed decision.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She sought to set aside the Consent Order on grounds that she categorized as follows: (a) misrepresentation; (b) duress and undue influence; and (c) emotional and psychological coercion.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I found that the Wife did not satisfy the requisite threshold to set aside the Consent Order. I elaborate on my reasons below, adopting the categories framed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Misrepresentation</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   False Legal representation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife alleged that the Husband had falsely claimed that the appointed lawyer was acting on behalf of both parties and yet consistently denied the Wife’s requests to communicate directly with the lawyer. This left the Wife without proper legal representation, making her vulnerable to the Husband’s exploitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following WhatsApp messages:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:58 PM – [H]: It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree. You want time slot, put in. You want cpf refund, I put in. You want joint account to spell out, I put in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:59 PM – [H]: Ok, then I ask them to draft, you can ask them as you are also the client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was that there was no such false representation. The involvement of the lawyer was limited to merely drafting the terms based on the discussions between the parties themselves. The Husband said that he was not well versed in legal terminology and mistakenly believed that engaging a lawyer was to ensure the proper handling of all necessary paperwork. During the meeting at his lawyer’s office, it was explicitly stated that the lawyer represented him alone, and the clauses in the IJ were drafted pursuant to parties’ private negotiations and agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife was apprised of her right to seek independent legal advice but made a personal decision not to personally engage a lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Further, the Husband said that the Wife had not presented the complete WhatsApp message.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[W]    I am uncomfortable with your lawyer, only acting in your benefit without any consideration for [T]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I am already giving you care and control part … all the house and car</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">who is squeezing who</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[H]    It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree.

It may operate as an important defence in the hands of a representee to vitiate a contract …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As elaborated at [80.189]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">An essential ingredient of an operative misrepresentation is that it influenced or induced the representee in his decision to enter into the contract. There would be no inducement if the representee did not know of the representation or was aware of its untruth or was not influenced by it, as where he would have entered into the contract even had he known the true facts or where he relied on his own judgment or investigations. Inducement refers to the causal relation, which is a question of fact, between the representation and action on the part of the representee to act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The WhatsApp message produced by the Wife showed that the Husband had represented to her that the lawyer was “our lawyer” and that “you are also the client”. While this was <em>prima facie</em> a misrepresentation, I found no evidence to suggest that it was fraudulently made. When the Wife attended at the lawyer’s office, she was told that the lawyer represented the Husband alone. This was evident from the acknowledgement signed by the Wife in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths, which stated as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Wife had considered the terms of the agreement and was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. Given these undisputed facts, the Wife could not be laboring under any misapprehension when she entered into the agreement. The misrepresentation was corrected and could not have influenced or induced her at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Moreover, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her own judgment in her negotiations with the Husband. This was borne out by her affidavit, examples of which are reproduced below:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.64%\"><col width=\"79.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Para 51.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">However, when I received the first draft of the divorce documents, I noticed that my access to [T] was stated as “reasonable access”.

Clearly, she was exercising independent judgment. There was no causal relation as such between the misrepresentation and her decision to enter into the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife claimed that without proper legal representation, she was vulnerable to the Husband’s exploitation. The Wife alleged that the Husband exploited her limited knowledge of Singapore’s divorce laws and her cultural background from Thailand, where women’s rights were less protected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, it was undisputed that she was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. It was her prerogative to seek help if she needed assistance. It would be inequitable for the Wife to blame the Husband for her lack of legal representation when she could have taken reasonable steps to obtain independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As was similarly observed by Debbie Ong J (as she then was) in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Starting with the arguments on the Husband’s capacity to appreciate the documents before him, if the Husband genuinely did not understand the terms of the 1<sup>st</sup> DCO, he could have sought assistance or expressed that he needed more time to consider them. As noted by the DJ, the Husband is educated, and held the rank of First Warrant Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces before his retirement. I also observe that more than a year elapsed between his signing of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> DCOs. I emphasise that it is a serious matter for one to sign a legal document before a Commissioner of Oaths or before a lawyer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     More pertinently, the picture that emerged from her evidence and the contemporaneous WhatsApp messages between the parties was simply incongruous with the case she tried to make out to the court. I found her to be assertive, and she certainly did not come across as one who could be easily induced, influenced, coerced or exploited. The fact that she was able to get the Husband to concede to her demands spoke for itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it should be noted that in a WhatsApp message to the Husband, the Wife herself had acknowledged that “we had good amicable agreement”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This message was sent on 27 September 2021,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> five months after the Consent Order was recorded. It put beyond doubt that the Husband had not taken any unfair advantage over her in the course of negotiating and settling the terms, and that the agreement reached was consensual. In light of all the evidence, it seemed more likely that the Wife was seeking to take advantage of the innocent misrepresentation by the Husband to advance her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Deception in Custody/Access Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife also alleged that the Husband misled her about the feasibility of shared custody and control of their child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.58%\"><col width=\"8.86%\"><col width=\"57.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">-</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: please change to joint care and control</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: I won’t sign</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.22 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: It can’t be done</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.23 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: So far I am very reasonable, trying work out the best for all</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/3/21, 12:01 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: 2.

There was nothing to prevent her from visiting the website and verifying the information for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Moreover, it was reasonable to infer that the Wife had some knowledge of the law, as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to shared care and control, which is a legal construct used by the court to make arrangements to support families where the child’s parents have separated: see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> (at [10] – [12]). The Wife would have known that the court may grant both parents shared care and control as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to “SHARED care and control”. If there was any doubt in her mind about the legal position, she could have sought independent legal advice if the issue was of concern to her. As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [5]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Wife was prepared, for her own private reasons, to acquiesce to sole care and control without seeking independent legal advice, it would be inequitable for her to accuse the Husband of deception, especially when she knew that he had relied on materials obtained from a legal website.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Deception in Financial Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Wife also alleged that the Husband had concealed his personal assets and directed her attention solely towards certain shared assets, preventing her from seeing the full picture of their financial situation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> She listed the following matrimonial assets that were not included in the IJ:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a.     Monies in parties CPF accounts</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b.     Parties’ matrimonial car estimated value of $90,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c.     Singapore Savings Bond of estimated $90,000 belonging to the Plaintiff and $30,000 belonging to [the Wife].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d.     Cash in hand at home amounting to an estimated value of SGD$3,000 (foreign currency).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>e.     Plaintiff’s savings account in China bank and other savings accounts in his sole name which [the Wife] have no knowledge of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>f.     Plaintiff’s Multiplier account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_g\"></a>g.     Plaintiff’s insurance policies and investment accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_h\"></a>h.     Other valuables estimated to be worth $10,000 (i.e jewelleries which the Plaintiff’s mother gifted to [the Wife] during the marriage, exercise bike, piano, household appliances/furniture).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     She submitted that the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties might result in a consent order being set aside by the court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response, the Husband pointed out that the Wife had a S$85,5000 Singapore saving bond under her name<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, a multiplier account which had approximately S$50,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and insurance policy and investment account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and she had drawn S$3,000 annually from the family fund to either save into her Thai bank account or her relative’s bank account to keep the cash somewhere which he did not know about.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> There were no jewelleries except a wedding ring which the Wife had already taken away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The assets listed in the IJ were the main matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I found no merits in the Wife’s allegations. Firstly, it was contemplated in clause 3g(c) of the IJ that the parties “shall each retain all other assets in his/her own names.” It should be noted that these “other assets” included assets in her sole name, such as monies in her CPF account and bank accounts, which were within her knowledge. Hence, she could not be oblivious that there were other assets that were not expressly listed in the IJ. Indeed, the whole point of clause 3g(c) was to allow the parties to retain these “other assets” in his or her sole name. In addition, the parties had also agreed to clause 3(g)(d) which made it clear that neither party “shall have any further claim against each other”. In short, the fact that the Wife was able to produce a list of matrimonial assets that were not expressly included in the IJ was not a basis by itself to set aside the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Secondly, if the complete accounting of assets was important to her, she could have requested that parties exchange a list of assets before agreeing to clause 3g(c) of the IJ, bearing in mind that the duty of full and frank disclosure cuts both ways. If she had done so and there was non-disclosure on the part of the Husband, she would be amply justified to set aside the Consent Order. But that was not the case here. The Wife was content to accept clause 3g(c) without the need for mutual disclosure. Contrary to her submissions, there was no concealment, let alone deception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Duress and undue influence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife submitted that that the Husband exerted undue influence over her by repeatedly pressuring her to agree to the Consent Order, using emotional manipulation and threats. She said that the Husband had insisted that if she did not agree to give him sole care and control of their child, he might remove himself from their lives, leaving the child without a father. The Husband also pressured the Wife during her busy work hours and claimed that he might only have a few years left to live. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Husband said that in the interest of promoting the child’s wellbeing, he agreed to joint custody as requested by the Wife. However, joint custody entailed fulfilling responsibilities towards the child, which the Wife had often failed to recognise. For example, in February 2021, when he enrolled the child in a preparatory course for the Gifted Education Program and personally covered the cost of $4,846, cooperation from the Wife was extremely challenging.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband said that the Wife was well aware that granting care and control to him was in the best interests of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The child’s wellbeing had been diligently attended to over the past three years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband implemented long-term plans to secure the child’s present and future needs, including relocating to a more conducive residence in preparation for the Primary School Leaving Examination, procuring property to cater to the child’s post-primary education requirements, and supplementing the joint account with additional funds to endure the child’s educational aspirations were adequately supported.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Testimonies from school teachers during teacher seminars affirmed the child’s happiness at school and flourishing social relationships.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>ATZ v AUA</em>, the court made the following observations (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it is normally the case (as in the present) that parties to a marriage would invoke the doctrines of undue influence or duress to set aside a marital agreement, given the emotionally charged circumstances in which such agreements are normally negotiated and executed. The existence of independent legal advice would normally be a strong indication of informed consent, which would undermine arguments relating to undue influence or duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, while the Wife was not legally advised in the entry into the agreement, she was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. In the same vein, this would undermine her arguments relating to undue influence and duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Moreover, as noted earlier, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently. In her own words, “we had good amicable settlement”. This could not be the case if she had felt pressured by the Husband to enter into an agreement she did not agree to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(5)   Emotional and psychological coercion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Wife also alleged that the Husband employed coercive and manipulative tactics during the divorce process to pressure the Wife into agreeing to an unfair settlement. The Wife claimed that the Husband avoided creating written evidence of his actions by insisting on verbal communications, leaving the Wife emotionally distressed after each interaction. The Husband played on the Wife’s compassion and vulnerability by making unverified claims about his health and resorted to deception, false blame, and threats throughout the process.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The picture painted by the Wife was that of a conniving husband taking advantage of a vulnerable spouse. However, this picture did not cohere with the objective evidence. Firstly, if the Husband had wanted to avoid creating written evidence, the Wife’s affidavits could not be replete with numerous written communications of their negotiations and related matters which she had relied on extensively in support of her case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also made use of some of these statements to disparage him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Secondly, as explained earlier, I found that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently in negotiating and settling the terms of the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Thirdly, in her supporting affidavit, the Wife averred as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… The Plaintiff created the illusion that my choices were <b>voluntary</b>. However, <b>upon closer examination</b>, I <b>now realize</b> that the Plaintiff deliberately orchestrated the entire divorce “discussion” toward unfair outcome for me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On closer examination, it would become apparent that this was an admission by the Wife that she had had entered into the agreement <em>voluntarily</em> at the material time. This is because it was only “now” and “upon closer examination” that she realised that she had been coerced. That being the case, she could not have acted under coercion when she entered into the agreement, as this would involve a diametrically opposite state of mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Indeed, in another part of her affidavit, the Wife had also stated that it was “<em>[o]nly in hindsight</em>” that she “<em>came to realize</em>” that she was coerced into signing the agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Hence, the case advanced by the Wife appeared to be an <em>ex post facto</em> attempt to conjure up a case of coercion when, based on her own admissions, none existed at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Finally, as noted earlier, the Wife had in a WhatsApp message to the Husband acknowledged that “we had good amicable settlement”. This put beyond doubt that she had acted on her free will and was not coerced into signing the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For the reasons set out above, I found that the requisite threshold for setting aside the Consent Order was not met. To sum up this part of my grounds, the following observations of Choo Han Teck J in <em>VWQ v VWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a> (at [9]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties, and the courts would be slow to re-write their contract. Privately settled terms negotiated by the parties, especially in family matters are to be encouraged. As such, they should be respected, and not lightly changed. Otherwise, one party may lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to call in aid the provisions in the Women’s Charter to vary their agreement (<em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a>) when they feel that the bargain was not to their liking subsequently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As also noted in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [12]), the need for finality is a significant consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it must not be forgotten that consent orders are the end of a process of “give-and-take” to harmoniously resolve a dispute between parties. There is another party, the Wife in this case, who has participated in negotiations towards an agreement and who has relied on the resolution process to move on from this dispute. The need for finality is a significant consideration: see <em>AYM</em> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I turn next to the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15] and [22]–[23]), the Court of Appeal made it clear that s 112(4) was not intended to confer upon the court a jurisdiction writ large, but a limited flexibility to adjust an order for the division of matrimonial assets already made. This would be, <em>a fortiori</em>, the case when the order of court was premised upon a consent order entered into between the parties themselves. Once the order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented or spent inasmuch as everything that was required to be done had been effected and the assets concerned had in fact been distributed to the parties concerned, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. Where the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court had not been completely effected or implemented, the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for division of matrimonial assets only when the order was unworkable or had become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As the case put forward by the Wife did not show that the Consent Order was unworkable or had become unworkable, there was no basis to vary the Consent Order. Moreover, the Consent Order with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As such, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. On either ground, the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody, care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn next to the Wife’s application to set aside/vary the Consent Order in relation to the custody, care and control of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Wife alleged that the Husband had engaged in parental alienation and attempted to exclude the Wife from the child’s life while falsely accusing the Wife of being an irresponsible parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Following the divorce, the Husband repeatedly reneged on agreed terms regarding the Wife’s access to the child and the matrimonial flat. His communication and actions became increasingly uncooperative, hostile, and abusive, including denying access to the child on public holidays, changing visitation arrangements without consent, and preventing video calls.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Wife alleged that the Husband had inflicted psychological harm on the child by coercing him to lie to the Wife about his whereabouts and activities. The Husband’s behavior, which included making unilateral decisions about the child’s schooling, health, and travel plans, significantly disrupted the co-parenting relationship and negatively impacted the child’s wellbeing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The Wife also accused the Husband of manipulating the child into referring to his new wife as “mummy” against the child’s will, using threats and punishment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> The Husband had also fed him false information and used access as a means of control, resulting in the child experiencing panic and anxiety.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife said that she had been the primary caregiver for the child since his birth and was deeply involved in his overall development, including academic preparation and various activities. Despite the Husband’s attempts to undermine the Wife’s role, the child had consistently expressed a desire to reside primarily with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The Wife requested for care and control of the child with the supervised access to the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Husband contended that the Wife’s baseless and frivolous allegations of her being misled and misguided into letting him have care and control of the child was simply untrue and unsubstantiated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> It was agreed between parties that the Husband would have care and control of the child as he had been the primary caregiver for the child since he was born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Since the Wife moved out from the matrimonial home in 2020, he had independently shouldered the responsibility of overseeing the child’s academic development and the child was thriving under his care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Husband said that despite the challenges of managing this responsibility single-handedly, he devoted his limited time with the child to providing guidance and encouragement. The child had consistently demonstrated improvement in academic performance and had earned numerous achievements. In a noteworthy accomplishment, the child secured a top three position in the class award for the first time in 2022. Even amidst the ongoing court proceedings since 2023, the Husband single-handedly persevered in maintaining the child’s academic excellence, resulting in him receiving the top three in the class award once again.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The child had numerous other academic awards and achievements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband said that the Wife moved out almost four years ago to pursue her own “happiness” but after learning about the Husband’s remarriage, she initiated the current lawsuit to disrupt the hard-earned stability that the child and the Husband had been enjoying.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> The Husband contended that he had dutifully facilitated her stated access terms pursuant to the Consent Order but the Wife was belatedly demanding for more access timings after she learned of the Husband’s remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Section 128 of the Charter provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     For the same reasons explained earlier, I found no basis to set aside the Consent Order for the custody, care and control of the child. Be that as it may, the central issue was whether there was any basis to vary the Consent Order. In practical terms, any order relating to the custody, care and control of the child would be forward-looking, as it would not be possible to undo the past, unlike the division of matrimonial assets where the order could be undone <em>ab initio</em>, and the assets redivided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The legal principles for the variation of a consent order on custody, care and control are markedly different from those applicable to the variation of a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets. This is why, as I had emphasized at [13] above, clarity of the submissions is important.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> (at [16] &amp; [17]), which concerned an application to vary the parties’ by-consent access orders, the Appellate Division (“AD”) held that the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances. The AD quoted with approval, the following passage from <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Relationships are dynamic. A parent who is not emotionally close to a child at the time an access order is made may, through time, build a much closer relationship with the child subsequently. For example, a young three­ year old child may have been clingy to his mother at the time the court orders care and control to the mother and limited access to the father. As the child grows older and builds a closer relationship with his father, it may be in his welfare to encourage increased access when he is, say, five years old. The child may have outgrown the phase of high dependence on and dinginess to his mother. There may not have been any one particular identifiable event that marks a material change in circumstances between the time he was three and five years old, but because relationships are dynamic, circumstances may have sufficiently changed such that a variation is warranted for his welfare. Hence, the court ought not to read s 128 of the Women's Charter too narrowly, but should take both a principled and pragmatic approach to the determination of a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As noted in <em>UBQ v UBR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29508-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 10</a> (“<em>UBQ v UBR</em>”) ([at [52]), the paramount consideration in a variation application is the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     From my review of the affidavits and the CER, I was satisfied that there had been a material change in circumstances for the purposes of the variation application. I noted that [T] was an emerging adolescent capable of forming an independent view. It was clear to me that [T] shared a close relationship with the Wife and desired to spend more time with her, compared to the current care arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     As this was sufficient for invoking the court’s power to vary the Consent Order, I did not find it necessary or helpful to dwell into the parties’ allegations in my brief grounds to assign blame. Neither do I think it is necessary or helpful to do so now, bearing in mind the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and not the past conduct of the parents: see <em>UBQ v UBR</em> (at [49]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     I found that both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him. The Husband had provided the child a stable living environment and ensured that his daily needs were adequately met. The Husband was committed in supporting the child over academic matters and had contributed significantly to the child’s academic achievement while the Wife had also been intentional in engaging the child in a wide range of activities and was attuned to the child’s emotional wellbeing. However, while both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him, they struggled with communication and co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     [T] was an intelligent child who had been doing well academically. Although he shared a close relationship with each parent, it was clear to me that he had been exposed to prolonged parental conflict and was torn between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The parties were agreeable to continue with the joint custody order. The main dispute centred on care with control. The Wife was seeking a reversal of care and control while the Husband wanted to continue having sole care and control of [T].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Section 125(2) of the Charter provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration is to be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court is to have regard —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Given the Husband’s strength in providing the academic support, granting the Wife sole care and control would deprive the child of the support by the Husband. However, granting the Husband sole care and control would also deprive the child of the time and attention that he so desired from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     [T] was a mature individual and at an age where he was capable of greater independence and expressing an independent opinion. Given his close relationship with both parents as well as his desire to spend more time with the Wife, I found that a shared care and control arrangement where he would be able to receive the support and care from both parents would be beneficial for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In addition, the parents would benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to work on their communication and co-parenting skills. [T] would also benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to support him amidst the parental conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     According, I varied the orders relating to custody, care and control as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parents be granted joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Parents be granted shared care and control of the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Husband to have care and control of the child from Saturday 8 pm to Wednesday (before school).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wife to have care and control of the child from Wednesday (after school) to Saturday 8 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parents to share equally the school and public holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Overseas Travel</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parents are at liberty to travel overseas with the child subject to giving the other party at least two months’ notice of the duration of travel, itinerary of travel, including flight details, accommodation address and emergency contact details. The notice period may be shortened by consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband shall release the child’s passport to the Wife at least 2 weeks prior to the intended date of departure or earlier if the said passport is required for travel visa application. The Wife shall return the child’s passport to the Husband when returning the child to his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Mutual Agreement</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Parties may vary the care arrangement by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Make-up parenting time</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Where a parent is denied parenting time with the child as a result of the unilateral decision of the other parent, the parent shall be entitled to make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Parents should endeavour to resolve any such dispute amicably before making an application to the Court for make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Counselling Support</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Parents and child to continue to receive counselling support at FAM@FSC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In my brief grounds, I had urged both parents to take positive steps to reduce their conflict, such as by exercising grace and flexibility in co-parenting and refraining from inflaming the situation. I reminded the parties that parental responsibility included supporting the child in having a close relationship with the other parent: see <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> (at [10]). The parties were advised to take heed of the following observations of Debbie Ong JAD in <em>DDN v DDO</em> (at [17]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements” …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     I emphasized that parental conflict was harmful to the child and made reference to the observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a> (at [40]). I also reiterated the following reminder in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [47]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parents must <em>find the resolve</em> to overcome the difficulties in co-parenting by a strong <em>commitment to discharging their parental responsibility</em>. Litigation has harmful effects on the child – materially, because the family loses in incurring litigation expenses, and psychologically, because conflict affects the whole family in ways not easily visible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     It is hence disappointing that despite the reminders and exhortations, the Wife had decided to appeal against the shared care and control order instead of doing her utmost to make the ordered arrangement work. While it is her prerogative as a litigant to do so, it would also mean that the litigation will be protracted. This would not be in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Finally, the Wife had also sought an order for the Husband to pay the Wife a reasonable amount of maintenance for the child. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The relevant provisions relating to the variation of maintenance for children are in ss 72 and 73 of the Charter. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> (at [15]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 73 provides that any agreement relating to maintenance may be varied where the court is “satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”. … the provision is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances of the parents as <em>a</em> basis for varying the maintenance for the child. Whether or not this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is of course a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     It is trite law that both parents have a duty to maintain the child. As regards the apportionment of maintenance, it is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In the present case, I found that the variation of the care and control arrangement would constitute a material change in circumstances. However, as noted above, whether this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of the case. In the absence of supporting evidence to enable the court to determine the reasonable expenses of the child and the financial capacities of the parents, there was no proper basis for me to decide whether and how the existing maintenance order should be varied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In the circumstances, I made no order on the Wife’s application to vary the existing maintenance order for the child.

Each had brought an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against each other. SS 217 of 2024 (“SS 217”) is the Wife’s application against the Husband for a PPO. In addition, the Wife also seeks a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) to exclude the Husband from her bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 218 of 2024 (“SS 218”) is the Husband’s application against the Wife for a PPO. In addition, the Husband also seeks a DEO against the Wife to exclude her from his bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband was represented by Mr Ignatious Cha (“Mr Cha”) and Ms Pearlyn Yeo (“Ms Yeo”). The Wife was represented by Mr Leong Zhen Yang (“Mr Leong”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the trial and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is hornbook law that to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities (<em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) at [13] – [14]; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [5] – [7]; <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the respondent had either committed family violence, or was likely to commit family violence; and that</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is necessary for the court to grant the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, the starting point is found in the definition set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”). That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In addition to ordering a PPO, a DEO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the “protection or personal safety of the applicant”. That is made clear by s 65(5)(<em>a</em>) of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    A protection order may, where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant, provide for such orders as the court thinks fit having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including any one or more of the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the granting of the right of exclusive occupation to any protected person of the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence by excluding the person against whom the order is made from the shared residence or specified part thereof, regardless of whether the shared residence is solely owned or leased by the person against whom the order is made or jointly owned or leased by the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 217 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I deal first, with the Wife’s application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 217</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       These are the incidents which the Wife relies on in support of her application for a PPO and a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 11 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to the Wife, this incident took place at around 10 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband had warned her to not show their son any YouTube videos on the projector and threatened to switch off the projector if his demands were not met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     An argument ensued. The Husband allegedly swung his left hand towards the Wife’s face. He stopped mid-blow such that his hand brushed past her right ear forcefully. The Wife says that the Husband did want to slap her, but stopped himself because he knew that there was a CCTV installed in her bedroom. She says that Husband would have been more brazen in his use of force had there not been a CCTV installed in her room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This incident was captured on the CCTV installed in the Wife’s room. The footage was played in court. It clearly shows that the Husband had tried to slap the Wife. He had, all of a sudden, swung his hand very quickly towards the Wife’s face. The Wife recoiled and tried to shield herself. Her earbud was dislodged and fell to the ground. The Wife retaliated by slapping the Husband twice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband had, in the course of his re-examination, given an explanation for having acted in this manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Right. Now, earlier in relation to the 11th December 2023 incident, Mr. Leong said that you did not just move your hand, but swung forcefully such that Ms. XJB’s earpiece dropped on the floor and you said you could explain. What do you wish to explain?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Mmm. Mmm. Okay, uh, on the 11th December, uh, twenty twen---uh, 2023, um, I noticed that, uh---uh, Ms. XJB is showing the, uh, projector to the kids in their rooms. And usually, when they show the projector, then the light is off, uh, turn off and---and they just show that, uh---uh, projector on the---on the---on the wall. And this one could, uh, strain the---the child eyes and does---and then---and [inaudible] uh, screen times. And, uh, because I want to, uh, discuss this with, uh, Ms. XJB’s, um, in a manner way. And, uh, during the---during discussion I found out that she didn’t, uh, listen carefully and didn’t pay attention to it. And I found out that, um, she have ear---earbud on her---on her ear. So, um, my intention just to take out the earbud, uh, from the ear and so we can have, um---um, so she can listen and have a conversation in a manner way. Uh, this is just to take out the, uh, earbud from---from her ear. And while I---while I take out the earbud, she quickly, uh, grab my hands and that’s caused the earbud to fall on the floor. And not just that, she also, um---uh, pulled my hands and pulled my body until I, uh, until my body is pulling---pull in front. Then not---not enough with that, she also hit me twice on my body. And I have to use my hands to, um, to defend it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband had also argued, in written submissions, that he had no intention of placing the Wife in fear of hurt, or that he had intended to cause hurt to the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He submitted that he “had simply wanted to stop the Wife from closing the door as parties h[ad] not addressed” the issue of the Wife letting their son watch YouTube videos on the projector in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I do not accept the explanations which the Husband had offered for his actions on that day. He had indeed swung his hand very quickly. It was aimed at the Wife’s face. Up till that juncture, it was apparent that both parties were engaging in conversation that was not particularly heated in any way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The circumstances as well as the Husband’s act of swinging his hand therefore do not support his stated intention of wanting to remove the earbud from the Wife’s ear so that they could have an uninterrupted conversation. It is thus clear to me that the Husband had committed family violence in that he had, to use the language of limb (a) (see above at [6]), wilfully, knowingly, or had attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, I add that insofar as the Husband alleges that the Wife had, by slapping him twice in retaliation, committed family violence, I do not find that to be the case. It is clear from the video that the Wife had been provoked by the Husband’s actions. Her two slaps appeared to have been done out of anger and frustration at how the Husband had behaved. She had also subsequently taken steps to disengage and de-escalate the conflict by closing her room door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Both the Wife and the Husband rely on this incident in support of their respective applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     This is the Wife’s account of events. She stated that she had planned to take their son to Johor Bahru.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband had given approval to do so. Their son, however, kicked up a fuss. The Husband construed this as their son being reluctant to go on the trip. He refused to hand over their son’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife describes the events which followed that took place at the void deck. She says that there was an argument. She said she wanted to call the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was when the Husband took their son’s passport and slammed it hard onto her left shoulder and the “motion came into contact” with her cheek, “causing a bruise”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife called the police immediately. She also exhibits, in her affidavit, a copy of a discharge summary dated 28 December 2023 showing the “diagnosis of the injury as contusion on” her cheek. In the course of her testimony, the Wife also said that the Husband’s younger sister had scratched her on the cheek during this incident. When she saw the doctor, she had told him that she suffered injuries on her left shoulder and cheek. According to her, the doctor could see that “there were red marks” on her cheek, and that the doctor also examined her shoulder and told her to monitor it for a few days.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by slamming the passport into her shoulder which resulted in a bruise, committed family violence within the definition of either limbs (a) or (b) (see above at [6]) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband, on the other hand, presented a different version of events in his affidavit. According to him, that incident had taken place at 11.30 pm. He had returned to the matrimonial home with his family members in tow. They had just come back from a trip to Kuala Lumpur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband states that he had argued with the Wife. He wanted to let their son sleep as he was exhausted. The Wife, on the other hand, refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Both the Husband and the Wife took their quarrel to the ground floor. The Wife continued to insist that she be allowed to bring their son to Malaysia. She asked for his passport. The Husband says that because it was raining at the time, and for their son’s sake, he used his son’s passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder and asked that she let their son return to the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife became aggressive. She accused the Husband of punching her. She screamed loudly and told both her parents, as well as her boyfriend, that the Husband had punched her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband attempted to disengage by retreating into the lift. The Wife, however, managed to trigger the lift alarm button. The police were called and officers eventually arrived on the scene.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Wife has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband had hit her forcefully on her shoulder with the passport which resulted in a bruise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For one, it is not disputed that the photo, marked “W2”, was indeed of the Wife’s shoulder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The time stamp indicates that the photograph was taken 2 days after this incident. The photograph does show what appears to be a faint bruise on the Wife’s shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Aside from the photographic evidence, there is also the Husband’s testimony. His account of events was that he had used the passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder. He does not dispute having made contact with the Wife’s left shoulder. This was what he had said in cross-examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.3%\"><col width=\"80.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Q:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mr. XJC, would you therefore agree that Ms. XJB’s evidence that you slammed the passport is consistent with what you said about---in---at paragraph 8 of your affidavit?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Your Honour, if I may---uh, if I may---uh, the word, the---what the lawyer I mean, say is “slam” which is I don’t agree with the “slam” word, it’s a tap.

You can disagree.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my judgment, the Husband’s use of the word “tap” was an attempt to downplay the force he had actually used during the incident. I find that he had slammed the passport into the Wife’s shoulder which resulted in a bruise. The Husband’s account of merely tapping the Wife on her shoulder is not consistent with the context in which the incident took place, which was amidst a quarrel. Having been showed evidence in the form of videos of other quarrels between the parties, I consider it likely that this quarrel on 27 December 2023 was also a heated one. The Husband’s account as to the amount of force he had used is therefore less plausible than the Wife’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Having found that the Husband had “slammed” the passport into the Wife’s left shoulder and caused a bruise, I also find that such an act falls squarely within limb (b) of the definition of family violence set out in s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 3 February 2024 (the “Air Tag Incident”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On this date, the Wife discovered that the Husband had planted an Apple Air Tag tracker in their son’s necklace.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Wife claims that this would allow the Husband to track their whereabouts when she takes the son out. She further claims that the Husband is doing this as a means of “conducting surveillance” on her. Consequently, she feels worn out mentally, extremely vulnerable and worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     She made a police report about this incident. That report is also exhibited in her affidavit. The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by planting an Apple Air Tag in their son’s bag to track her movements, committed an act of family violence within the meaning of limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband, in the course of his testimony, did not deny placing an Apple Air tag tracker in his son’s necklace, as well as his bag.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Husband claims that he had done so to ensure his son’s safety and that he had seen the need for this after December 2023. This was because he had noticed that whenever the Wife sent their son to school, and picked him up, the Wife’s close male friend would be present.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This led the Husband to be concerned about his son’s safety. As he explained:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[A]fter the fetching the school---from the---from the school, she frequently, uh, bring the child’s together with the this---third party, and, uh---they put---they do things, uh, together like, uh, dinner together, even watch movie together, evens, uh, go to shopping malls together. Yah. So, uh, this has been repeatings and when the kids go home and---and told me that, uh, there is this, uh, that’s the---there’s another guy that involved in this. And I repeatings mention to Ms. XJB, which is my wife to say I---do not do this---uh, do not do in front of the kids. Want to do is, uh, do your own, don’t involve the kids. Yah. And she---uh, she’s just ignoring me and just keep continue doing that. Yah. So, for me, uh, there’s a third party involved and some time they reach home it’s quite late sometimes. I can see from the time here is, uh, 11:00 or some time it reach homes, uh, past midnight as well. Uh, until the kids already sleeping and when---when they reach home, the kids already sleeping. So, uh, and she didn’t tell me where they go and---and what---what they do and did they go. So, I found it as a signs of me to---to me---need to know, uh, whether or not my son is in the safety. So, I need to like at least to know, uh, where I can find my son, if need---if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It appears that the Husband may have had one other reason for placing an Apple Air Tag on the son’s belongings – that was, to find out if his Wife was having an affair, and if so, who she was having an affair with. The Husband had told me that he had first learnt about the Wife’s close male friend from their son. When he confronted the Wife about this, she mentioned that he was merely a Grab driver.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Her story soon changed – she subsequently gave other conflicting accounts as to who this man was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s decision to place an Apple Air tag in his son’s bag was likely motivated by an incident which took place on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2023. He was looking at his Wife’s phone and when he tried to make a video call on her phone, he noticed that there was already an active video call in progress. This was what he saw:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"24.66%\"><col width=\"75.34%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yes.

I do not find that the Husband had planted the air tags with the purpose or intention of stalking the Wife. Had he intended to do so, the air tags would have either been planted on her belongings, or cleverly concealed. This was not the case. As the Wife herself had testified:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Now, Ms. XJB, was the Apple AirTag stitched to some secret compartment of the child’s bag?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Yes, inside the compartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Ms. XJB, the---the question was yes or no.

I do not find that the Husband’s actions of planting the Apple Air Tag in the son’s belongings constitute harassment towards the Wife, nor do I find that he had done so with the intention of causing her “anguish”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 November 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This incident, according to the Wife, took place at around 9.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She had returned home from work. The son had not bathed. The Wife took their son to the toilet for a bath.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     During this time, the Husband entered the Wife’s room without her permission. He rummaged through her bag and checked her handphone. The Wife did not consent to this. She says at that time, the both of them were contemplating divorce. It was thus likely that the Husband was looking for evidence to “build his case for ancillary matters in the divorce”. The Wife says the Husband had, by going through her phone, violated her privacy. She also says that the Husband’s actions fall within limb (d) of the definition of family violence (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband’s explanation was that he had done this for the sake of their son. He explained that when he tried to text the Wife, she did not pick up. He had therefore gone into her room, picked up her phone, and used his phone to send her a message on WhatsApp to see if she could receive it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He admitted that he had done this despite knowing that relations between himself and the Wife were not good, and that if the Wife discovered that he had been rummaging through her belongings, it would only serve to worsen matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, denied that he had gone into the Wife’s room on previous occasions and rummaged through her belongings, and checked her phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I do not find this incident which the Wife complained of falls within the definition of family violence under limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. It has not been established that the Husband had indeed, on other previous occasions, snuck into the Wife’s room, rummaged through her belongings, and checked the contents of her phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this incident, the Wife was spending time with their son on the sofa in the living room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Husband had come and sat next to her despite knowing that she was uncomfortable being in close proximity with him. The Wife alleges that the Husband continued to harass her by moving close to their son. She believes that the Husband wanted to exploit her fear of being near him to deny her the space and freedom of being in her own home. She claims that she could no longer “enjoy or feel safe in the flat”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Wife also exhibits footage of the Husband allegedly harassing her by “coming so close” to her personal boundaries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Again, the Wife says that the Husband’s actions constituted continual harassment as defined in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The video was played in court. It clearly shows the Husband seated next to the Wife on the couch. The Wife then stands up and moves to sit away from the Husband, putting their son in between them. In the process, a cushion was flung, presumably by the Wife, onto the seat that she had just vacated. The clip ends with the Husband kissing the son on the head.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     While the Wife may feel annoyed, frustrated, or angry at being in close physical proximity to the Husband, in my judgment, his actions do not constitute harassment. As the Husband had explained, he had joined the Wife and the son on the couch because it was their routine to watch television with their son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I find that the Husband’s actions were not calculated at “causing anguish” to the Wife, but rather, intended to give their son a sense of normalcy as far as possible by keeping up with their Sunday routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 2 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This incident occurred at 11.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Husband had tried to enter the Wife’s room multiple times on the pretext that he wanted to remove the remote control to the air conditioner. What he really wanted was to remove the CCTV that the Wife had installed in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     When the Wife saw the Husband heading towards the CCTV, she quickly pushed him out of the room. She tried to close the door. The Husband resisted and prevented her from doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     An argument ensued over the Wife’s use of the air conditioner in her room. In the course of this argument, the Husband suddenly came “very close” to the Wife and shouted in her face. The Wife says this was an act of aggression to intimidate her. She retaliated to demonstrate that she would not cower in the face of such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     During this time, the scuffle continued, with the Wife using her body to push against her bedroom door to prevent the Husband from entering her room. The Husband, however, forcefully pushed against the door, causing the Wife to fall “backwards on[to] [her] back”. The Wife’s head hit the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife subsequently obtained a medical report from the Accident and Emergency Department. It was exhibited in her affidavit. The primary diagnosis was a “sprain of shoulder”. The secondary diagnosis was a head injury.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife also claims that prior to this incident, both the Husband and his family had been very aggressive and had made several threats against her. Her case was that the Husband had, in this incident on 2 February 2024, caused hurt to her, and this was an act falling within limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having watched the video footage, which was also played several times in court, it is clear to me that the Husband did not commit family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The video shows both the Husband and the Wife tussling at the door. The Husband is trying to gain entry into the Wife’s room. The Wife, on the other hand, is barring his way and trying to push him back out into the corridor. As the Husband tries, once more, to force his way in, he does not appear to be using much force. The Wife tries to stop him. In the process, she loses her balance. Her knees buckle. She reaches out to grab onto something to arrest her fall. Her hand finds the Husband’s neck and arm. The Husband is also dragged down. He falls on top of her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     That the Wife fell down, and suffered an injury to her shoulder and head, was not, in my judgment, a result of the Husband shoving her forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife cites this incident as an example of how the Husband had escalated his “harassment and aggression” towards herself as well as her mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Wife alleges that that the Husband had placed his hand very close to her face, as well as that of her mother, under the “guise of making a video recording” of the both of them. She says that the Husband did so “in order to apply physical force” on the both of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In written submissions, the Wife clarifies that her reference to this incident was merely to “show that there was an escalation of tensions between the parties”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In any event, having reviewed the footage, I do not find that the Husband had intentionally placed his hand very close to the Wife’s face under the guise of making a video recording when his true intention was to apply physical force. Parties were, at the time, both filming each other, presumably so that they would both have evidence to present in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other allegations of family violence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged family violence, the Wife also raises a host of other acts of family violence which she says the Husband had committed on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     First, the Wife says that the Husband had harassed her by unlocking her room with the master key and entering without her permission or giving advance notice. This was in spite of her informing him that he needed to seek her permission before doing so given that the both of them were already living in separate rooms by that point. The Wife also says that she was, on several occasions, improperly attired when the Husband barged in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The second instance of such harassment the Wife cites was in relation to the Husband installing CCTV cameras around the flat. She says that this has led to her living in “fear and surveillance”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Apart from this, the Wife says that the Husband had intruded into her personal boundaries, planted an Apple Air Tag tracker on their son (see above at [x]), and threatened to ransack her room. Taken together, these were, according to the Wife, acts that constituted continuous harassment meant to cause her anguish.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Finally, the Wife accuses the Husband of abusing her mentally, and cites the following examples.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     For one, the Husband had taken away the remote control to the air conditioner, forcing her to endure “the heat with just a fan”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife also says the Husband had cut off her Wi-Fi. In addition to this, the Husband would, on or around July 2022, slam or bang on her door early in the morning simply because he was unhappy. When she opened the door, he would just stare at her and walk away. This apparently happened for a few months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Wife also accuses the Husband of threatening her in mandarin – he would tell her: “I will want to see how you eventually die without me”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Having already addressed the specific incidences of family violence which the Wife has raised, and found that the Husband’s actions in two of those incidents did constitute family violence (above at [16] and [32]), I do not think it necessary to deal with these other allegations the Wife has levelled against the Husband. Doing so would only run the risk of increasing the acrimony between the parties who are currently in the midst of divorce proceedings. I echo the views of the court in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Apart from s 65(1), <b>there are also good reasons why, in principle, a court should not be obliged to make findings as to whether family violence has been committed for every allegation raised by the parties</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>The purpose of a PPO is not to punish a party for past acts of such violence</b>: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him</em> at [10]; <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“<em>GFS</em>”) at [31]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]; <em>UMI v UMK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [37] to [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   Instead, a PPO is “pre-emptive” in purpose – i.e., it protects an applicant from future family violence. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is in danger of family violence, then a PPO should be issued even if such violence has not been committed on the applicant previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   Additionally, in the case of cross-complaints involving parties in a highly acrimonious relationship, <b>there is a real risk of the parties expecting the court to adjudicate on who was “right” or “wrong” regarding their past differences</b>. A PPO trial is not a forum to settle personal scores. There is little utility in expending court resources to scrutinise each allegation of family violence when it is already clear from the evidence or from a party’s conduct in court that he/she is ready to engage in escalatory “tit-for-tat” for the most minor slight perceived from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For completeness, however, I deal with the Wife’s argument that based on the incidents which took place on 28 November 2023 (above at [40]), 28 January 2024 (above at [44]), February 2024, 3 February 2024 (above at [33]), and the CCTVs installed in the home since 16 December 2024, it is clear that the Husband had committed family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I do not find that these incidents, when considered together, demonstrate that Husband had embarked on a campaign of harassment against the Wife. As I had explained above (at [38] – [39]), the Husband did have reasons for putting an air tag in the son’s bag, as well as going to sit next to the Wife on the couch. In any event, these alleged incidents took place during a time when parties’ relations were strained to the breaking point. The suspicion and mistrust that arose likely coloured the Wife’s view of these events, giving her the impression that the Husband was trying to harass her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Having found that the Husband had committed family violence (above at [16] – [32]), I turn now to consider the necessity of a PPO as well as a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The inquiry into whether a PPO is necessary involves a risk assessment as to the likelihood of a respondent committing family violence against an applicant in the future: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. This involves an examination of, <em>inter alia</em>, the reasons and circumstances for family violence and whether the family violence was a recent occurrence. Red flags that point to the necessity of a PPO include: a) likelihood of interactions between the parties; b) that the underlying cause for family violence remains unresolved; c) respondent specific factors (<em>ie</em>, where the respondent is deeply antagonistic towards the applicant or where the respondent has a propensity for violence): <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In addition, the necessity requirement also encapsulates an assessment of whether a PPO is necessary to <b><em>deter</em></b> family violence – as the court in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> had observed (at [23]), this is because a PPO essentially converts acts which are typically non-arrestable offences, into an arrestable offence. This is because the commission of such acts would be considered a breach of a PPO, and such a breach is an arrestable offence under s 65(11) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I would add that the PPO regime recognises that there will be, in any relationship, some degree of conflict, and that the actions of parties could conceivably fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in the Charter. However, it is only where this conflict rises to a point where intervention is warranted that a PPO will be granted to protect the applicant from harm and/or abuse. This finds expression in the “necessity” requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the circumstances, I find that it is necessary to grant a PPO, as well as a DEO to exclude the Husband from the Wife’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     It is clear to me that there was no love lost between the Husband and the Wife. The videos produced in court showed the intensity of their quarrels. There are also unresolved issues that provide the kindling for further conflict – for instance, the Husband’s suspicion that the Wife had been cheating on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     It is also not the case that both the Husband and the Wife are able to completely break off ties and go their own separate ways. They are still staying in the same house. Their close physical proximity to each other has, and can only continue to, create further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As to the necessity of a DEO, that stems from the fact that a number of the incidents here have arisen from the Husband’s attempt to enter the Wife’s room despite her having told him, on no uncertain terms, not to do so. The DEO is necessary to ensure that the Wife has her own undisturbed space within the house and to minimise the possibility of further conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Finally, I will also order that the PPO and DEO shall only be effective for a period of 2 years from the date of this judgment (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). This is because the divorce proceedings between parties would, in all likelihood, have concluded by then. After the ancillary matters have been resolved, parties would have embarked on their own separate paths. Contact may well be minimal, and limited to matters concerning their son. This would greatly reduce the opportunities and avenues for conflict that necessitate my granting of the PPO and the DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     In addition to the PPO and DEO, I am also ordering that both the Husband and Wife go for counselling to equip themselves with the necessary tools to better deal with and manage their conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband’s application in SS 218 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I turn now to consider the Husband’s application for a PPO and DEO in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 218</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Husband relies on the following incidents in support of his application for a PPO and a DEO against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 13 September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The first relates to an incident on 13 September 2023 at 11.55pm. This was what the Husband had said in his affidavit:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11.    The Respondent and I have quarrelled over her claim that my parents entered her room without her consent. She has also accused my parents of bringing “black magic”-related paraphernalia into her room. Her claims are obviously trivial, frivolous, and false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12.    She has clear anger management issues and has screamed at me and physically assaulted me by scratching my upper body which left visible scratch marks. After doing so, she called the police. When the police arrived and saw my scratches, he asked whether I would like to report abuse/violence. I had no intention of pursuing the matter back then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     In essence, the Husband’s complaint is that in this incident, the Wife had physically assaulted him by “scratching [his] upper body which left visible scratch marks”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In written submissions, the Husband had argued that because counsel for the Wife did not cross-examine the Husband on this point, it leads to the conclusion that she had accepted the Husband’s account of events.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife, on the other hand, argued in written submissions that the Husband’s account should not be accepted. This was because the Husband had not adduced any supporting documents. There was also an “abject lack of details” in the Husband’s AEIC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> And even taking the Husband’s case at its highest, the Wife’s actions could not constitute family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband’s argument, though it does not explicitly say so, urges me to apply the rule laid down in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 (“<em>Browne</em>”). As was noted in <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0855.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 855</a> at [17]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 <em>prima facie</em> applied. This rule stands for the well-settled proposition that (per Colin Tapper, <em>Cross and Tapper on Evidence</em> (Butterworths, 8th Ed, 1995) at p 319, which was cited in <em>Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 2 SLR(R) 0936.xml')\">[1999] 2 SLR(R) 936</a> at [48]; see also M N Howard et al, <em>Phipson on Evidence</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 1990) at para 12-13):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Any matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The rule in <em>Browne</em>, however, is not a “rigid, technical rule”. In the words of the court in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0292.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292</a> (cited with approval in <em>Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18816-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 944</a> at [115]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42    Before leaving the issue of oral evidence, I should comment briefly on the effect and relevance of what is referred to as the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67. <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is a case of some vintage and it lays down a rule of fairness. The effect of that rule is that where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission. It is not a rigid, technical rule. Nor is it necessarily satisfied by a formulaic recitation of a party’s case to a witness, with an invitation merely to agree or disagree. In <em>Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/47211-M.xml')\">[2005] 2 SLR 236</a> at [15], Choo Han Teck J noted that the rule which is derived from a case more than a century old must be applied with due regard to the realities of modern litigation and in evaluating any given objection, consideration should be given to the totality of the evidence in the case. I think that is correct. In <em>Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina</em> [2002] 1 SLR 408 the Court of Appeal noted (at [40]) that the rule is not rigid and does not require every point to be put to the witness but this would generally be required where the submission was “at the very heart of the matter”. This was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46445-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 4</a> at [49]–[50]. I approached the evidence and the submissions in this case in that light.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     That the Wife had not been cross-examined on this point does not necessarily mean that I am bound to accept the Husband’s version of events. Indeed, I do not. While the Husband has recounted this incident in his affidavit, he has not exhibited any documents to support his claim. For example, there are no pictures of the scratches which the Wife had allegedly inflicted. Further, given that the police had been called, one might expect that a police report or some other documentary evidence be exhibited, notwithstanding the fact that the Husband had stated he had “no intention of pursuing the matter back then”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I add that even accepting the Husband’s account, that the Wife had indeed scratched him, he has not established whether her actions amounted to family violence. That is because his account of events (above at [81]), does not set out fully the circumstances in which the Wife had scratched him. It also does not describe the extent and severity of the scratches allegedly inflicted upon him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Husband has therefore not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife had indeed committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The second is an incident which took place on 2 February 2024 at 11.30 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also relied on this incident in support of her application for a PPO in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The Husband’s account is that the Wife had returned to the matrimonial home and turned off the doorbell camera. When confronted by the Husband, the Wife admitted to doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Husband says that the Wife had turned off the doorbell camera out of spite and with the intention of provoking him. He says that she had done so several times previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     On this occasion, the Husband responded by informing the Wife that he would be turning off the CCTV she had installed in her room, as well as the air conditioner. He further informed her that she would have to bear part of the utilities expenses if she wanted to enjoy the comforts of air conditioning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     This sparked a quarrel. The Husband says that when the quarrel took place, he was standing outside her room and holding the door. The Wife insisted on pushing him out of the room, and in doing so, scratched him all over his body. The Husband was left with visible scratch marks. He exhibited photographs at Tab C of his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Amidst this scuffle, the Wife tried to retreat into her room. She lost her balance and fell to the ground. The Husband denies pushing her. He says that she had lost her balance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Having fallen down, the Wife began to “scream and cry loudly”. The Husband retreated from her room. He says that she was able to stand and walk around normally. The Husband went to the living room to wait for the police officers who arrived a few moments later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Husband’s case is that the Wife had caused hurt to him when she scratched him, and hit him on his neck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having watched the video, it was clear to me that there was a scuffle between the Wife and the Husband at the entrance to the Wife’s bedroom. The Husband was trying to force his way into the Wife’s bedroom, and she was trying to resist. The video shows the Husband feinting to his left, as though he was about to disengage from the scuffle, before suddenly twisting around and trying to barge past the Wife. The Wife managed to hold her ground, and it was in this context that she had struck his neck. In my judgment, the Wife’s actions do not constitute family violence within the definition of either limb (a) or (b) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     As to the scratches which the Husband had allegedly sustained, he was cross-examined at length on whether the video showed that the Wife had indeed inflicted these scratches on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> He was also cross-examined on the manner in which he had described these scratches in the police he had filed a day after the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    In my judgment, the Wife had indeed scratched the Husband during this scuffle. The Husband had produced pictures of scratch marks on his body, namely his shoulder and arm. It is also clear from the video that the Wife had indeed grabbed the Husband. Taken together, it is likely that the scratches the Husband sustained were indeed caused by the Wife during the scuffle. I also note that the Husband’s evidence, in his affidavit, that the pictures of the scratch marks on his body were indeed the injuries he had suffered in the altercation with the Wife, was never challenged in cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    That being said, I do not find that this falls within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (b). These were minor scratches. It cannot be said, from the pictures of these scratches the Husband had exhibited, that the Wife had indeed caused hurt to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Finally, I add that even if the Wife’s acts of hitting the Husband on the neck, and scratching him, were considered acts of family violence, the Wife is entitled to rely on the Self-Defence exception (see <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [10] – [13]). The video makes it clear the context in which the Wife had used such force on the Husband. She was trying to stop him from intruding into her personal space. She did not use excessive force in doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I come now to the incident on 27 December 2023. The Wife had also relied on this same incident to support her application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    The Husband’s case is that in this incident, the Wife had committed family violence because she had wrongfully confined or restrained him, together with their son, as well as his elderly parents against their will in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Husband appears to suggest that because he was never cross-examined on his account of events<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> – that the Wife had, by asking “her boyfriend and mother to hold the lift at the ground floor” and even pressed the alarm button – his account of events should be accepted and so he has proven that the Wife had wrongfully confined or restrained him in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Even accepting the Husband’s account, I do not think that the Wife’s actions fall within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (c) of s 64 of the Charter. As the court in <em>UEJ v UEK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20636-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 90</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> had noted (at [40]), the threshold for wrongful confinement or restraint is higher than a situation where a complainant’s movements were “somewhat restricted” by a respondent for a “certain duration”, and especially where such incidents had occurred in a public place and not in a private or restricted area.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Based on the Husband’s account, the Wife had merely tried to prevent him from taking the son back up to their flat. This had occurred in a public area amidst a quarrel between both the Husband and the Wife. Given the Wife’s actions and the circumstances in which she had so acted, I do not find that her actions had crossed into the realm of family violence in that it could be said that she had “wrongfully confined” or “restrained” the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The Wife had also cited this incident in support of her application for a PPO (above at [57]). In written submissions, the Husband further submitted that this incident would “better support his application for a [PPO] against the Wife”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband cites the fact that the Wife had “intentionally provoked him” in this incident by “video recording him”, “knocking multiple times on his room door” and “knocking on his mother’s room door” although she had already gone to bed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The Wife raises a preliminary objection. She says that the Husband should not be allowed to make a claim based on this incident. That is because this incident was never part of the Husband’s case, and so the Wife never had an opportunity to respond to the allegation which the Husband is now levelling at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    It is well-established that incidents which arise after an application for a PPO has been filed may be taken into account provided that the respondent: a) had not been taken by surprise, and b) had been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the evidence at the trial: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21(g)] citing <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [57] – [60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the present case, the Husband had not included this incident in his complaint form. There is also no account of it given in his affidavit. There was therefore nothing to which the Wife could respond. Given this, I will not take this incident into account in considering the Husband’s application in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Wife is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    As was noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16], there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence had been committed. It suffices to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence is likely to be committed against the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    An example of when the court has found that family violence is likely to be committed is the recent decision in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>. In that case, a video tendered to court showed that both the husband and wife in that case had knowingly harassed each other. The video showed both the husband and wife recording each other during their altercation whilst accusing each other of provocation. The court also found that there was “deep and long-standing animosity” between the both of them which was evident from the numerous police reports the both of them had filed, each accusing the other of having committed family violence (<em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [12] and [14]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    In the present case, I find that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband. On the evidence put before me, it was clear that the quarrels between both the Wife and the Husband were becoming increasingly heated. That was clear to me from the videos which showed how the Wife had responded in the incident on 11 December 2023, as opposed to how she had responded in the incident on 2 February and 20 April 2024. These videos show the Wife acting in an increasingly confrontational manner towards the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    I would add that the additional video which the Husband tendered, which showed a different angle of the incident on 20 April 2024, also showed that the Wife did provoke the Husband. The Wife did not object to this video being produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    That video shows the entirety of the quarrel between the Husband and the Wife on that day. The Husband had gone to the Wife’s room. He knocked on the door. When there was no response, he walked away and took off his shirt. He returned soon after and tried knocking on the Wife’s bedroom door again. After a few attempts, the door opened. The son ran out and into the Husband’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    The Wife, as well as her mother, came out of their bedroom. They went to knock on the Husband’s bedroom door. The Wife’s mother pulled out her handphone in an attempt to record the Husband’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Frustrated at being filmed, the Husband attempted to grab the handphone from the Wife’s mother. Witnessing this, the Wife goes and knocks on the Husband’s mother’s bedroom door. The argument escalates and the Husband’s mother is dragged into the ensuing argument. The Wife enters the room where the Husband’s mother had been sleeping in and begins shifting various objects out. I must add that unlike the Wife’s mother, who played an active role in the argument, the Husband’s mother can be seen attempting to restrain the Husband and to calm him down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The video clearly shows that the actions of both the Wife, as well as her mother, had only served to provoke the Husband and to escalate matters in that incident. The Wife also agreed, when it was put to her in cross-examination, that she had, by her actions in this incident, intentionally provoked the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    When considered in totality, the various video clips which parties had played in court showed an escalation in tensions and aggressions between the parties. The Wife clearly had a role to play in this escalating conflict. She chose to react in a manner that was not only confrontational, but also rather aggressive at times. The manner in which she reacted in all these incidents which were captured on video spoke to the likelihood of her committing family violence against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Having found that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband, it logically follows that a PPO is presumptively necessary to protect the Husband: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Leaving aside the presumption, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that it is indeed necessary to order a PPO. Parties are still living together in the same flat. They are currently undergoing divorce proceedings. It is also apparent to me that there is a great deal of animosity between them. Given that the both of them still continue to share the same space, it is likely that they will continue to interact and come into contact with each other. This will only provide ample fuel for further conflict (see also my findings above at [75]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    In the circumstances, the Husband’s application for a PPO is allowed. This PPO shall be valid for a period of 2 years (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). For the same reasons which I had set out above (at [77]), I find it appropriate, in this case, to limit the PPO to a period of 2 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    However, I do not find it necessary to allow the Husband’s application for a DEO to exclude the Wife from his bedroom. The evidence before me does not show that the Wife had attempted to set foot into the Husband’s bedroom. The Husband’s application for a DEO is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    To summarise, the Wife’s application for a PPO and DEO is allowed. I am also granting the Husband’s application for a PPO, but not for a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    Unless parties are able to agree, I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    Finally, I conclude with some brief remarks to both the Husband and the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I have made the relevant orders against the both of you. There are consequences if it is found that you have wilfully breached those orders: s 65(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Stop fighting. You have a young son. These are his formative years. Do not let his childhood be sullied by the bitterness of your quarrels. Focus on how the both of you can work together to give your son the best possible start in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Treat the counselling sessions seriously. They are meant to help you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    It remains for me to thank Mr Cha, Ms Yeo and Mr Leong for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\"

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Lynette Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was the Mother’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Father for herself and their three young children, [A] who is 4 years old and twins [B] and [C], who are 1 year old. The Mother also applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial flat where they resided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over 4 days. The Mother testified and called 5 witnesses - her father, 3 domestic helpers and her aunt. The Father testified and called 4 witnesses - his mother, his aunt and 2 friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Upon conclusion of the trial, I directed parties to file written submissions and reserved my judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Court will only grant a PPO if the following two requirements are fulfilled:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Family violence must have been committed, or there is a likelihood that family violence will be committed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The evidential standard of proof to be applied in PPO proceedings is that of the civil standard of “on a balance of probabilities”, and not the more stringent “beyond reasonable doubt” criminal standard of proof. However, the protection conferred by a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions. Pursuant to s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), a person who wilfully contravenes a PPO is guilty of a criminal offence and will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. In addition, a police officer who has reason to suspect that a person has wilfully contravened a PPO may arrest the person without a warrant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Given these criminal consequences, a PPO will not be lightly ordered<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, this is set out in s 64 of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Allegations of Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother’s case is that the Father had committed family violence against herself and the 3 children under all 4 limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In her opening statement, the Mother asserted that the Father had an unstable mental state, a violent disposition and was quick to anger by nature, and that even before the marriage, he had at times exhibited low mood, low self-esteem and was easily agitated. She also stated that he repeatedly acted in a verbally abusive, threatening and hostile matter towards her, especially from 2020 onwards. She asserted that over time, his unpredictable mood and frequent outbursts of anger towards her caused her to feel constant background anxiety when he was around her. She further asserted that after their eldest and then the twins were born, the Father’s abusive and violent behaviour also affected them<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In deciding this case, I considered whether family violence has been committed by the Father under the different limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(a) Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Under limb (a), it is important to bear in mind that the acts of the perpetrator will not constitute family violence unless he acted with an intention to place the victim in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the victim would, by the acts, be placed in fear of hurt. These are “subjective” states of mind in that the perpetrator must have the requisite intention or knowledge<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. For example, a perpetrator might express his frustration in the presence of the victim. This act alone, without the requisite intention or knowledge, will not constitute family violence even though such expression may be inappropriate and ill-advised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<em>UNQ</em>”), a mother applied for a PPO on behalf of her children against their father. She alleged, among other things, that the father had thrown things around the house including a metal coffee mug. The father denied these allegations. The Family Division of the High Court held that the act of the father in throwing a metal coffee mug could amount to family violence if there was evidence that the children were standing in the direction where the mug was flung. The Court found that the act of the father, even if true, was at worst inappropriate but did not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will now consider the incidents relied on by the Mother to mount her case that the Father had committed family violence by wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place her and the children in fear of hurt:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Mother alleged that on or around 9 August 2016, shortly after parties were married, parties had an argument and the Father shouted at the Mother and tried to pin her to a cabinet. The Mother alleged that he caused her hurt and pain and bruised the back of her hand<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father’s version was that the Mother had raised her hand and tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away out of reflex to ensure that the Mother would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with her arm<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As this was the Mother’s application, she had to prove that the incident occurred in the manner she alleged. I find that the Father’s account of the incident was more credible than that of the Mother’s and I accepted the Father’s evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. I also note that there was no contemporaneous evidence such as a police report or a medical memo that the incident occurred in the manner alleged by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Furthermore, this was an isolated incident that occurred back in 2016. No other incidents are alleged to have occurred between 2016 and 2020, and the parties continued to live together, with no evidence that the Mother had been put in fear of hurt as a result of this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On balance, I do not accept that the Mother has proven that Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother next relied on an incident that occurred four years later in 2020, when she became pregnant with [A]. The Mother explained that [A] was conceived by way of intra-uterine insemination (“IUI”) and she underwent multiple IUI attempts in 2019 involving numerous hormonal injections over multiple months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother stated that she suffered from frequent bleeding and was hospitalised due to threatened abortion in her first trimester and threatened premature labour in her second and third trimesters. It is the Mother’s case that the Father had frequent outbursts and would yell at her when he visited her at the hospital. He had also said that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage. She stated that as she “feared for the safety of (herself) and the yet-unborn (child)” she moved into her parents’ home to live with them after she was discharged from the hospital. She also continued to stay with her parents after she was discharged a second time from a government hospital in July 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father denied her allegations. He stated in his affidavit that the Mother was in and out of hospitals frequently due to her difficult pregnancy. He denied telling the Mother that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage and stated instead that he had told her that in the event of a difficult birth, he would much rather she live instead of the unborn child. He stated that the parties had disagreements on whether the Mother should transfer from a private hospital to a government hospital. He further stated that the Mother needed 2 daily injections at a clinic near her parents’ home and decided it would be best for her to live at her parents’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     During cross-examination, while the Mother maintained that she moved into her parents’ place because she feared for the safety of herself and the unborn child in April 2020 after her first discharge from hospital, she was unable to identify any specific incident of alleged violence committed by the Father before April 2020 other than the incident in August 2016. On the stand, she conceded that to the best of her memory she was unable to recall<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. When probed further if she could identify any other incident of violence stated in her affidavit before April 2020, she did not refer to any specific incident but instead referred to paragraph 51 of her affidavit where she had stated generally that throughout her pregnancy, the Father would have frequent violent outbursts and shouted at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s alleged outbursts and shouts at the Mother will not constitute family violence unless he had the requisite “subjective” state of mind, in the sense that he must have had the intention or knowledge to place or attempt to place her in fear of hurt. The authorities are clear that a mere expression of frustration by the perpetrator in the presence of the victim made without any such intention or knowledge will not in itself constitute family violence even if such expression may be inappropriate and ill advised<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. On the whole, I do not accept that the Father’ outbursts and shouts, even if accepted, would amount to him wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place the Mother in fear or hurt. I will also add that the documents relied on by the Mother did not assist her in proving that she had been in fear of hurt due to the father’s actions. She had exhibited an inpatient discharge summary from a private hospital dated 13 April 2020, stating that she had been admitted since 20 February 2020 for “threatened abortion”, an inpatient discharge summary from SGH dated 14 July 2020 where she had been diagnosed for “threatened premature labor” and another inpatient discharge summary dated 2 August 2020 where she had been diagnosed with “premature or threatened labor”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. She further exhibited a memo from the Women’s Mental Wellness, KKH dated 28 August 2020 that stated that her stress levels were very high<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. None of these documents prove that the Mother’s medical conditions were caused by any specific act of family violence committed by the Father. They certainly did not show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incident in or around July 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother stated in her affidavit that the Father had come to her parents’ house where she was living after her second discharge from hospital to visit her. Both of them got into a disagreement on the preparations for the baby’s arrival and the Father shouted at her using vulgarities. The Mother alleged that he hit the wall and the bedframe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Father’s version was that the Mother had given him a number of tasks to prepare for the arrival of the baby. He had not completed all of them and the Mother made remarks such as “you’re not ready to be a father?” and “how can I trust you if you can’t even get these simple things done”. He stated that he swore in frustration at the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In my judgment, the Father’s alleged act of shouting at the Mother with vulgarities and his actions of hitting the wall and the bedframe, even if true, was at worst inappropriate and ill-advised. There was no evidence to show that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by the acts be placed in fear of hurt, for example if there was evidence that he had aimed his punch in the direction of the Mother and had hit the wall and the bedframe instead. I am unable to conclude that the Father’s actions constituted family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident on or around 23 August 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The next incident cited by the Mother occurred when the Mother and her parents went to the parties’ matrimonial flat where the Father was living alone to pick up some clothes. Prior to that, the Mother’s parents had ordered a baby’s cot to be shipped there and the Mother had asked the Father to assemble the cot as the Mother had hoped the both of them could live together after the baby was born. While there, the Mother found that the place was in a mess and the baby’s cot was only partially assembled and a disagreement arose between the parties. The Mother alleged that the Father shouted that she was accusing him of being a bad father, even though she had not done so, and that he yelled at her and her father to get out of the house and shouted vulgarities. He also threw the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Father’s version was that he was living alone in the matrimonial flat. The Mother and her parents arrived and started berating him and finding fault with him and the state that the house was in for at least an hour before he raised his voice and told them to stop shouting at him. He denied that he had touched anyone or made any gesture that he would hit or use physical violence against anyone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     On the facts, I do not find that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. The Mother’s allegation was that he had thrown the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists. It was not her case that he had thrown the baby’s items at her or that he had aimed a punch in her direction and hit the wall instead. At all times, the Mother was free to leave the matrimonial flat and disengage from the disagreement if she had truly been in fear of hurt. Furthermore, even if the Mother had indeed been in fear of hurt, I was unable to conclude from the evidence that the Father had the requisite mental element.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">5. Incident in or around December 2020 after [A] was born</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     After [A] was born, the Father moved into the home of the Mother’s parents. The Mother stated that she wanted to keep the family intact and was reassured that her parents would be physically present if things got out of hand. The Mother stated that the Father appeared to be unhealthily obsessed with [A], and “whenever someone (like me) tended to [A], (he) would get disproportionately upset…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father denied that he had behaved in a threatening manner. He explained that his requests for permission to spend time with [A] were met with unjustified ridicule, scolding and doubts from the Mother and her parents. He felt that this was humiliating and even when he requested to take [A] downstairs around the block to walk, this request would be rejected or they would say he needed to be accompanied by the helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In or around December 2020, the Mother alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father then shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid the Father. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. Her fear was exacerbated because she had claustrophobia which she had told the Father about before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother stated that she eventually managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Mother’s father gave evidence that he and his wife rushed home upon receiving the Mother’s call. He asked the Mother if the Father had beat her, and the Mother responded that she was afraid that the Father would have hurt her physically if her parents had not come home as soon as they could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father denied these allegations. He stated that the Mother was in a bad mood that day as he had accidentally left the fridge door open in the morning. This upset the Mother as she said that the breast milk could spoil and could kill [A] if he drank it. She commented that the Father was a danger to the baby and that the baby he would die in his care. The Father stated he had apologised profusely to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father stated that he had asked the Mother if he could spend time with [A]. Three hours after the Mother had been in the room with [A], he went in to check in on them. He denied that he had tried to snatch [A] from the Mother. He explained that when the Mother started accusing him, he did not want to leave the room for fear that the Mother was suffering from post-partum depression. His version was that the Mother pushed and punched him and dug her fingers into his arms before she called her parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. He exhibited undated photographs of injuries he claimed to have sustained on his arm. He also exhibited contemporaneous WhatsApp messages he had exchanged with his friend that day to support his version of what had transpired<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Since this is the Mother’s application for a PPO, she has to prove that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place her in fear of hurt. I have considered the evidence available before the Court and I am unable to find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. It was her case that the Father wanted access to [A], but she refused as she did not want [A] to be disturbed from his sleep. What ensued thereafter was a disagreement between parties as to who would get to spend time with [A]. Even on the Mother’s own evidence, there are no allegations of actions by the Father that could be construed to be placing or attempting to place her in fear of hurt. I did not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Father had acted with the necessary intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by his acts be placed in fear of hurt. His actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">6. Incident on or around 12 February 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother stated that during Chinese New Year, the parties were at the home of the Mother’s relative. The parties had planned to go for dinner at the Father’s parents’ home after that. The Mother had told the Father before they went to her relative’s home that they would only be able to leave for his parents’ home after she had finished breastfeeding [A] to avoid disrupting his feeding schedule. The Mother stated that at that time, the Father had agreed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Mother stated that while she was breastfeeding [A] in her cousin’s room, the Father came into the room and demanded that they leave for his parents’ home as they were late for dinner. She reminded him that they had agreed to leave only after [A] had finished breastfeeding. The Father began to shout and demand they leave immediately. She was shaken and in fear and called her parents over the phone. Her father came into the room and asked what happened. The Mother explained that she needed more time to feed [A], and her father told the Father to call his parents to explain that they would be late and the Father stomped out of the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Mother’s father gave evidence in his affidavit that he also left the room after the Father left and when they were outside the room, he told the Father to be more reasonable to give the Mother more time to tend to [A]’s needs. The Father became angry and started to raise his voice and banged his fists on the wall and furniture<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     After the Mother finished breastfeeding [A], parties left the relative’s place and the Mother alleged that the Father drove in a dangerous manner to his parents’ place, weaving in and out of traffic even though the Mother and [A] were in the car, and she feared for their safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father’s account was that parties were almost 2 hours late for dinner with his parents. He was frustrated that the Mother did not want to leave her relative’s home. He stated that he had hit a soft cushion on the chair but he denied punching the furniture or the wall of the relative’s home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, even if the Father had punched the furniture and the wall (which was denied by the Father), that could not amount to wilfully or knowingly placing the Mother in fear of hurt since it was not done in her presence but only after the Father had left the room she was in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, I do not accept that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. I will also add that despite the alleged concerns of the Mother’s relatives, all of them, including her father, had allowed the Mother to leave with the Father for his parents’ place. The Mother’s relative also confirmed at the trial that she called the Mother to ask if she had reached the Father’s parents’ place safely and the Mother confirmed this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7. Incident in or around May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It is the Mother’s case that after a couples counselling session, the Father shouted at her during the car ride back. The impact of him shouting at her was exacerbated by her claustrophobia as she was trapped in the same space as the Father who was driving the car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father’s case was that the Mother started accusing the Father of not informing the counsellors about an incident that took place on 8 May 2021 and the parties had a disagreement where he was upset with the Mother. The Mother requested to be dropped off near her home and he dropped her off.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On the facts, I found that a disagreement arose between the parties while the Father was driving the vehicle and this led to the Mother being dropped off the car at her request. I do not find that there was any evidence to support the Mother’s contention that she had been in fear of hurt or that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">8. Incident on or around 6 June 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother claims that the Father had shouted at her for about an hour at her parents’ home and harassed her to move out of her parents’ home. Her parents tried to intervene and the Father shouted at them to get out of the room and continued shouting at the Mother inside the room. The Father then went on a hunger strike and refused to eat, knowing that this would cause the Mother anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father stated that he was merely discussing the matter of moving out of the home of the Mother’s parents. He denied going on a hunger strike to cause distress to the Mother and explained it was because he lost his appetite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my judgement, even if the shouting and the alleged hunger strike had occurred, I do not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. In addition, there was no evidence to show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt. The Mother was clearly free to refuse to move out of her parents’ home without any consequences, which was in fact what happened on 8 June 2021, when the Mother did not join the Father when he moved out of the home of the Mother’s parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">9. Incident in or around August 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     More than a year later, in or around August 2022, the Mother stated that after parties attended a marriage workshop, the Father shouted at her in public for not being a good wife and called her a “bad wife” and a “bully”. She was afraid of being near him and walked away. Parties eventually went home separately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father explained that the Mother had raised an unresolved issue from the marriage workshop, insisted that she had “reached the end of the road for this marriage” and it was she who started raising her voice at the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I do not find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. There was no evidence of any physical threat. The Mother’s own evidence was that she “walked away from (the Father) to distance (herself) from (his) shouting and public humiliation of (her)” and proceeded to “(take) the MRT back to” her parents’ home. I accept the Father’s submissions that at all material times, she was free to and did in fact disengage and leave the Father by taking public transportation to her parents’ home. I did not accept that the Mother had shown that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed her in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">10. Incidents from 7 June 2023 to 12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties went overseas in June 2023. The trip comprised 8 people: the couple, [A], the helper, the Mother’s parents, a pastor who was also a friend of the Mother’s father and the pastor’s wife. The Mother’s brother had committed suicide overseas a few years before that and the family were there to commemorate his death anniversary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     By this time, the Mother was expecting twins. [A] was then 2 years and 9 months old. The Mother asserted that during the trip, the Father would shout at [A] whenever he was “tired or emotionally dysregulated”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She listed the following 4 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">7 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Mother alleged that on 7 June 2023, while parties were in a maxicab to their Airbnb accommodation, [A] was tired as he had not slept well on the plane and was being fussy in the maxicab. The Father shouted at him to stop and threatened to beat [A]. He also threatened to leave [A] in the maxicab.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">9 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother alleged that on 9 June 2023, parties were at a playground when [A] became hungry and tired. Parties walked to a shopping street to have lunch and [A] was behaving in an unsettled manner and crying. The Mother asked the Father to carry [A] so that she could order food, but [A] did not want the Father to carry him and made a fuss. The Father pinned [A’s] arms down and forcefully carried him away from the café. The Mother asked the helper [E] to go check on [A] and after a while, [E] returned and said she was unable to make [A] calm down. The Mother left the cafe to look for the Father and [A]. She could hear [A] crying and the Father yelling and threatening to abandon [A] in the shopping street.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">10 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Mother alleged that on 10 June 2023, all 9 of them were in a maxicab, heading to a columbarium outside the city. [A] was tired and started to cry. The Father shouted at [A] saying that he would have the maxicab driver take him away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">11 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Mother alleged that on 11 June 2023, as their flight back to Singapore was very late, around 11 pm, [A] was tired as it was past his bedtime. He was also restless and hungry and started to run around the airport and at times, he would get upset and cry and yell. In response, the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave him behind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Mother’s own evidence, at its highest, is that the Father shouted and threatened [A] when [A] was tired, fussy or crying while they were overseas. In my view, while the Father may not have acted in the most exemplary manner when dealing with a tired toddler who was crying and fussing on an overseas trip, I do not accept that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11. Incident in or around August 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother gave birth to twins, [B] and [C] on 14 August 2023. She alleged that shortly after she returned to her parents’ home, the Father shouted at her and demanded that she pack up all her things to move to their own matrimonial flat. In her closing submissions, she submitted that she was put in fear and felt compelled to move to their matrimonial flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Father’s evidence is that he spoke firmly to the Mother and the Mother eventually agreed to move to their matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I found it hard to accept the Mother’s submissions that she was in fear of hurt, nor was there any evidence of threat beyond that of a quarrel. This contradicted her own evidence in her affidavit that she moved to live with the Father as she was “hoping to give the marriage another chance for the children’s sake, especially the twins”. She had also stated that she “had no choice but to move into the (residence) with (the Father) as there was no space at her (parents’ flat) for the twins”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. I rejected her claim that she was in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">12. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The helper, [E], engaged to care for [A], stated in her affidavit that sometime in September 2023, she was at the matrimonial flat with [A] as it was a weekend. [E] alleged that [A] woke up during his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying, but [A] did not stop crying. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg, causing him to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. [A] had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E]’s evidence was that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and [A] instead started hitting the Father. The Father told [A] to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I accept the Father’s account of the incident. Apart from [E], no other witnesses, including the Mother herself, gave evidence on this incident in their affidavits. According to [E], [A] was having difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed, and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly and it was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]. Yet despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. I also note that the Mother herself has given no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, if it had indeed transpired as [E] described, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case. On balance, I preferred the Father’s account of what occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     This incident was also only mentioned in [E]’s affidavit. According to [E], the Father, [A] and herself were on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby of the matrimonial flat as the Mother was breastfeeding [B] and they wanted to keep [A] away from the Mother. [A] was crying because he wanted to be with the Mother. [E] alleged that the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block, which was the highest floor of the block. [E]’s evidence was that [A] cried, then suddenly became unnaturally quiet. [E] alleged that after this incident, [A] became very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, saying, “I don’t want, I don’t want. Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father disputed [E]’s account entirely. He stated that he was unable to recall such an incident as he had never threatened to leave [A] at the highest floor of the block. He asserted that it was the helpers and the Mother’s parents who used this threat when [A] lived with them on weekdays. He did not know if anyone had actually taken [A] to the top floor of the matrimonial flat before. He stated that [E] herself had also jokingly threatened to take [A] to the top floor if he misbehaved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I preferred the Father’s evidence over [E]’s. I found it difficult to accept that a toddler would have the concept of the 17<sup>th</sup> floor as the highest floor and become very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, to the extent that he would say specifically “Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button” after only 1 incident when he was threatened on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby, which was on a completely different floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In any event, even if the Father had threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block (which I did not accept), I do not see how this caused [A] to be in fear of hurt. I also do not see how the Father could be said to have wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">14. Incident on or around 17 March 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Mother exhibited an audio recording of the Father shouting at [A] in the car and threatening to beat him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The Father explained that this recording was taken 3 weeks after the Father stopped talking with the Mother and her parents. He wanted to go to church that day as he needed to pray. Before parties got into the car, [A] started claiming that he did not want the Father to go to church with them. The Father ignored this. Inside the car, [A] sat on the Mother’s lap in the front passenger seat and was holding a portable fan. [A] started hitting the Father with the portable fan while saying, “I don’t like dada, I hate dada”. The Father told him to stop being rude. [A] did not stop even after he was told by the Father to stop thrice. The Father took the portable fan away from [A] and told him that he was going to discipline him. The Father maintained that he did not hit [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The transcript of the recording showed that after the Father told [A] to “stop beating people already”, [A] stated “Later I beat you Dada. I beat”. When the Father stated, “You want me to take out the cane?”, [A’s] response was “Go Away”. In fact, [A] tells the Father 3 times to “Go away”. On the whole, I did not find that the Father’s actions were anything out of the ordinary in the normal disciplining of a child. I reject the proposition that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">15. Incident on or around 4 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Mother stated that [A] was with them at the matrimonial flat as it was a weekend. The Mother suspected that the Father had contracted Covid-19 and asked him not to go too close to the twins especially since they were born premature, making them more susceptible to illness than their peers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     [A] was helping to feed [C] in the playpen but the Father wanted to feed [C] instead. The Mother reminded the Father not to go too near [C] as the Father was unwell. The Father shouted at the Mother that she was preventing him from having access to [C]. He also shouted at [A], saying it was unfair that [A] who was sick could feed [C], when he could not. The Mother stated that [A] then cowered in fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Subsequently, the Mother, [A] and [E] (the helper who looked after [A]) went out. When they returned around 4 pm, the Father approached [A] who did not want to speak to the Father. The Father got angry and started to scold [A] for having “shit values” and that he was brought up by the Mother and her parents to be hateful. The Mother asked [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room to be away from the Father. She then carried [B] to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. The Father continued to yell at her and accused her of telling everyone that he was crazy and not a good father. He berated her for not being a good mother. She started to video record him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Father submitted that the video recording submitted by the Mother showed that he walked away from the Mother right after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I do not accept that the Mother or [A] was in fear of hurt. There is no evidence that the Father threatened any act of physical violence. At all times, the Mother was fully in the position to intervene and disengage, as when she told [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room. She was also able to go out with [A] in the afternoon. She also went freely to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. I also did not find that the Father had the necessary intent to place or attempt to place her or [A] in fear of hurt. He walked away from the Mother after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">16. Incident on or around 9 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The Mother’s version was that her mother was at the matrimonial flat that afternoon to care for the twins and her mother had a scuffle with the Father’s mother who had also come by to the matrimonial flat. The Mother rushed home from work and then texted their marriage counsellor [Y]. Subsequently, the Mother heard objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives. He also slammed the door of the study room. She went upstairs to investigate and heard the Father shouting while he was talking with [Y] over the phone. The Mother overheard that he was shouting “cunt”, “motherfucker”, “hateful” and “go to hell”. She deduced that [Y] must have called the Father after receiving the Mother’s text message. She captured an audio recording of the Father taken from the outside the study room shouting while he was on the phone with [Y].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Shortly after, the Father opened the door of the study room and saw the Mother standing in the hallway of the second floor. He came very close to her, pointed threateningly at her and shouted at her. She started recording his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The helper who looked after [B] came up the stairs and took [B] whom the Mother was carrying. The Father turned away from the Mother and walked away and the Mother took the chance to go to the first floor. She then called the police and while waiting for the police to arrive, locked herself, the twins [B] and [C] and the 2 helpers who looked after [B] and [C] in a room. The Mother submitted a copy of a memo from her psychologist dated 10 May 2024, whom she had been visiting since August 2017 for “mental health support due to stress and emotional trauma<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father submitted that the recordings did not show that he had sworn at the Mother or that he had directed his outburst at her. He submitted that the Mother’s psychologist was not called as a witness. More importantly, the psychologist’s memo dated 10 May 2024 did not state that family violence had been committed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On the whole, even if the events had occurred as alleged by the Mother, I do not accept that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. If she was indeed fearful after hearing objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives and slamming the door of the study room on the second floor, it is unlikely that she would choose to walk upstairs to investigate and try to hear and audio record what the Father was saying in his conversation with [Y] behind closed doors. I accepted the Father’s submission that there was also no evidence that he had wilfully or knowingly placed the Mother or the children in fear of hurt. He was expressing his frustrations in the study room with the door closed when he was speaking to [Y] over the phone. The audio recording also showed that the Father was addressing [Y] and saying that “he did not want to fight (the Mother)” and that he “will not beat her and he will not touch her”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. I also note that the Mother had admitted at the trial that she had actually not seen the psychologist whose memo she exhibited dated 10 May 2024 on both the material dates of 9 and 10 May 2024. Her psychologist had also not met the Father as well<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. There was also nothing in the memo that supported the Mother’s contention that family violence had been committed on 9 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17. Incident on or around 22 and 23 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The Mother alleged that sometime in the middle of the night, [C] woke up and began to cry. Both the Mother and the Father went downstairs where the helper who looked after her was patting her to sleep. The Father kept asking the helper to pass [C] to him but the helper did not want to. The Father accused the Mother of instructing the helper not to hand [C] to him. He then stomped away. The Mother went back upstairs to her room to sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Mother alleged that shortly after, she was lying in bed when the Father barged in and shouted at her and accused her of preventing him from having access to [C]. She hid under her blanket and remained silent. After shouting for a while, the Father left the room. She then locked the door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The next morning, while the Mother was getting ready for work, the Father continued to accuse her of preventing him from carrying the twins. She called the police as she was concerned the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him in an attempt to deter his abusive behaviour. Instead, the Father got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Before the Mother left the house, she wanted to carry [B] for a while to say goodbye. The Father who was sitting in [B]’s playpen and carrying [B] refused and asked the Mother why she needed to carry [B] and stop the Father from spending time with [B]. She told him she was not stopping the Father from spending time with [B] and she just wanted to carry [B] for a short while. She then entered the playpen to take [B] out and carried him while the Father followed her around the residence and accused him of not letting him have [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     After the Mother put [B] down and left him in his helper’s care, she went to the main door of the residence to leave for work when the Father berated her from a distance, again accusing her of not letting him have [B]. He then approached her threateningly while she was at the main door. The Mother said she feared for her safety and went towards a “safety room” where the helpers of [B] and [C] were and tried to close the door. However, the Father stuck his arm into the opening of the doorway and shouted that the Mother could not lock herself, the 2 helpers and the twins in the room as that would deny him access to the twins. He then struck the door of the room with his arm that was in the opening of the door multiple times and threatened her that he would tell the police that she had hurt him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After a while, the Father removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. At the same time, the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Father disputed the Mother’s allegation that he had grabbed her arm and shook her while she was trying to film him. He also disputed that the room was a “safety room” and alleged that the Mother would always take the children into the room when she wanted to deny him access to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     After considering the evidence, I did not find that family violence had been committed. Despite having the CCTVs in the matrimonial flat, and having her phone recording on, the only recording submitted by the Mother of the Father allegedly shaking her violently was only 5 seconds long and did not show the Father shaking her violently<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The recording also showed that the Father did not raise his voice at her. In any event, I will add that even if the Father had grabbed the Mother’s arm and shook her, this action did not cause the Mother to be in fear of hurt. The Mother’s own evidence was that shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in and carrying [B] in as she wanted to spend time with [B]. If she was truly in fear of hurt, it was inexplicable that she would dare to approach the Father who was sitting in the playpen with [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     For completeness, I will add that the Mother’s evidence was that even before the police arrived, the Father had removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. Again, if the Mother was truly in fear of being hurt, it really did not make sense that she would allow [C] and the helper to leave as surely [C]’s need to be fed could wait till the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">18. Incident on 25 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Mother alleged that on 25 May 2024, a Saturday, the Father wanted to take [C] out to a picnic with his friends. The Mother did not agree that he should take [C] out on his own without the support of the helpers. The Father threatened to take [C] out of the residence and to the picnic and also threatened to stop her from taking [A] out for his activities if she did not allow the Father to bring [C] out for the picnic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     The Mother was afraid that the Father would go through with his threat of stopping her from taking [A] out and called the police for assistance. The Father learnt that she had called the police and followed the Mother from the living room to the main door where she was waiting for the police. He accused her of denying him access to the children and said that if she did not let him have the children, he would not allow her to have the children and threatened to have Child Protection Services take the children away. When the policemen arrived, they spent a substantial amount of time in the Father’s room. Subsequently one of the policemen called the Mother to the room and spoke to both of them together. The Mother made a police report regarding the incident. As she was afraid for both her and the children’s safety, she asked her mother to stay with them until the following Monday 27 May 2024 when she applied for PPOs for herself and the 3 children as well as a DEO in respect of the entire matrimonial residence. On 27 May 2024, an Expedited Order was granted to restrain the Father from committing family violence against the Mother and [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Father denied the Mother’s assertions that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, what transpired was that a disagreement broke out after the Mother refused to allow the Father to take [C] out to a picnic. I did not see how this could have caused the Mother or the children to be in fear of hurt. I also did not see how the Father could have the necessary intent to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">19. Incident on 1 June 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The Mother alleged that she had returned to the matrimonial flat after bringing [A] to his art class. The Father was carrying [B] in the living room while she was in the kitchen. Suddenly, the Father blurted out without any provocation, “Daddy doesn’t want to be around hateful people. Such hateful people with hateful values”. She alleged that the Father handled [B] roughly while putting him down in the playpen, causing [B] to cry. The Mother alleged that the Father did not even bother to soothe [B] and simply walked away and shouted at the Mother, “Get out of my face and out of my life”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. The Father then went upstairs and slammed the door of the study room<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In the Mother’s closing submissions, she stated that she had been in the kitchen at that time, away from the Father and had not spoken to the Father nor done anything to him before this outburst. She submitted that “it is clear that the Father is volatile and unstable. He can suddenly lose control of his temper and flare up over nothing, putting the subject of his anger in danger”. She submitted that the Father’s handling of [B] in his agitated state suggested that when the Father is angry or agitated around [B], [B] would likely to be hurt or put in fear of hurt by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having viewed the video recording and examined the transcript<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, I am not convinced that the Father had put [B] down in the playpen in a rough manner as alleged by the Mother. The area in the living room where the playpen was is not large. I accepted the Father’s explanation that he put [B] down as he wanted to leave the living room so as to not to engage further with the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     The Mother’s own evidence showed that she was not in fear of harm. She had originally been in the kitchen, away from the Father. I failed to see how she could have been in fear since after she heard the Father blurting out that he did not want to be around hateful people, she then voluntarily chose to come out of the kitchen to the living room where the Father was with [B] before the Father then said, “Get out of my face and get out of my life”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">20. Incident on 27 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Mother alleged that he had questioned the helpers in a threatening manner multiple times throughout the day after having read their affidavits. The Mother alleged that he hurled insults and expletives at her including “big liar”, “lying bitch”, “lying scum” and “vile human being”. She alleged that the Father “was standing in close proximity to (the Mother) and pointing and gesturing at (the Mother) while he insulted her. He could have hurt her physically if she had responded or retaliated to (his) tirade”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    The Mother further alleged that the Father had also involved his own mother and aunt to take [C] out of the home that afternoon despite the Mother’s objections. She submitted that “by taking [C] out of the home in the context of his threatening behaviour towards (the Mother) and the helpers that day… (he) was demonstrating that he, as the aggressor and as head of the household had control and dominance over the (Mother) and the children. After parties’ affidavits were exchanged, (he) felt the need to re-exert control over the Mother and the children”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The Father denied that family violence was committed. I accepted his submissions. Although the Mother submitted multiple recordings, text messages and a police report regarding the 27 July 2024 incident, none of the evidence showed that the Father had made any threat of hurt to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. I also note that it was the Mother who walked into the kitchen when the Father was talking to the helper. If the Mother was in fear of the Father, it defies logic that she would voluntarily walk into the kitchen and be in the Father’s way. The video also shows that the time period where the Father had interacted with the Mother in the kitchen only lasted for 40 seconds<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    For all the reasons stated above, I find that the Mother has not proven her case under limb (a) in that she has not shown that the Father had willingly or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother or any of the children in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(b) Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Physically abusing a family member constitutes family violence under limb (b). There are, however, two types of force which are exempted from the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used in self-defence and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age (“the Correction Exception”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Mother relied on 2 incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to her and 2 other incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to [A]. I will consider the incidents in turn:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    As stated in paragraph 13 above, the Mother had alleged that the Father had pinned her hand to a cabinet and bruised her hand sometime in August 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I had accepted the Father’s version of what transpired in paragraph 15 above, that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away so that she would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with the Mother’s arm. His evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination at the trial<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> was consistent that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him. There was no police report or medical evidence to the contrary. I accepted the Father’s evidence that he had acted in self-defence and I reject the Mother’s claim that the Father had committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident on or around 22-23 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The only other incident where the Mother alleged that actual physical hurt was caused to her is stated in paragraph 85 above. The Mother alleged that she had called the police as she was concerned that the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him. The Father instead got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently, causing pain and soreness to her arm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    I had found above in paragraph 90 that the video recording of the Father allegedly shaking the Mother was only 5 seconds long and did not show that he was shaking her violently. The Mother also did not produce any medical reports to show that she had suffered any injury or pain on her arm. Her own evidence did not suggest that she had suffered any injury, since shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in with [B] and ask the Father to pass [B] to her so that she could carry [B] to say goodbye before she left for work. In my judgment, the Father’s actions were in response to the Mother calling the police and taking out her phone to record him and I do not accept that actual physical hurt was caused to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incidents from 7 June 2023-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    The next 2 incidents concerned [A]. The first incident occurred just after parties had taken the maxicab from the airport and arrived at their Airbnb accommodation. The only person who gave evidence that the Father had beat [A] was [E], the helper who looked after [A]. [E]’s evidence was that after they got off the maxicab, the Mother passed [A] to her parents to take care of him as the Mother was feeling very tired from carrying [A] throughout the whole flight from Singapore. [A] could not stop crying as he wanted to stick with the Mother and the Father took [A] from the Mother’s parents and “forcefully hit his buttocks and legs multiple times to stop him from crying”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    [E]’s account directly contradicted the Mother’s account of what transpired. The Mother’s evidence was that it was her father who brought [A] to his own adjacent Airbnb apartment and after a while, when her father managed to soothe [A], he brought [A] back to the Mother and the Father’s Airbnb apartment but when [A] saw the Father, [A] started crying again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    This alleged incident of physical hurt to [A] was also completely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father who was allegedly the one the Father took [A] from. If the Father had indeed taken [A] from the Mother’s father and then hit [A] forcefully on his buttocks and legs multiple times according to [E]’s account, it was puzzling why this important event was not mentioned at all in the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    On the whole, I found it difficult to accept [E]’s account that the Father had taken [A] from the Mother’s parents and hit him as it contradicted the Mother’s own account of what had transpired and it was entirely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    For completeness, I will add, that even if the Father had used physical force on [A] (which I did not accept), I would have gone on to consider if this fell within the Correction Exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    While there is, as the Family Court observed in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> (“<em>VYB</em>”) at [11], growing suggestion internationally that physical punishment produces detrimental consequences in children, the Correction Exception remains part of Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    If indeed the Father had spanked [A] as claimed by [E], I am of the view that it could fall within the Correction Exception if it was done for the purpose of teaching discipline with a measure of good sense, in a judicious and responsible manner, and for the benefit of the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. It was not in dispute that [A] was tired and had not slept well on the plane and had cried throughout the maxicab ride to the Airbnb. The Mother was very tired from carrying [A] throughout the flight and needed to rest, yet [A] still wanted to remain with the Mother. In my judgment, the Father’s correction of [A] in these circumstances would not have constituted family violence. The common law, which continues to underpin legal regulation of the relationship between parent and child in Singapore, has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline on the chid, including some degree of physical punishment as long as it is a reasonable one. In <em>VYB</em>, the Court identified at [14] - [15], several related factors that shed light on the reasonableness of the physical punishment by a parent of a child. These include the reasons for the punishment, the nature of the punishment, and the age and personal characteristics of the child. I am of the view that the Father’s spanking of [A] on his butt and legs was not unreasonable considering the circumstances: that the Mother needed to rest after the flight but [A] was still crying and wanting to stick to her. I will also add that even if this incident of spanking could be considered harsh for a young child, consistent with the observations in <em>TCV (On behalf of Child, A) v TCU</em> [2015] SGFC at [14], the law does not intervene through the issuance of a PPO in every instance of parenting that exceeds the Correction Exception and a PPO will not be granted unless it is necessary for the protection of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    This was the only other incident in the Mother’s closing submissions where it was alleged that actual physical hurt had been caused to [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    As stated in paragraph 63 above, [E] had alleged that [A] woke up from his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying but he would not stop. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg. [E]’s evidence was that this caused [A] to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. He had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E] stated that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and instead started hitting him. The Father told him to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop bearing [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    I had accepted the Father’s account of the incident as stated at paragraph 65 above. As I have stated, despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. The Mother herself also gave no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    I will also state that I do not find that the Father’s method of discipline towards [A] was overly excessive such that it crossed the boundaries set by the Correction Exception and amounted to family violence as defined in the Charter. There is also no evidence that this correction was for the Father’s own “gratification of passion” or “rage”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> as submitted by the Mother, and I do not accept her submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had caused hurt to her and/or [A] under limb (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(c) Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    The Mother also relied on limb (c) to state that when the Father had stood at the doorway when the Father stood at the doorway and blocked her from leaving the room with [A] in or around December 2020, he had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    As per paragraph 31 above, the Mother had alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid him. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. The Mother stated that eventually she managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    I had found earlier at paragraph 36 that it was the Mother’s actions of carrying [A], who was the subject of the disagreement, and trying to leave the room that led to the escalation of the situation. The Father’s actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give. I do not find that the Mother was confined or restrained in her room. In fact, it was her own evidence that she managed to leave the room with [A] and that she got past the Father. In my view, the Mother could easily have left [A] who was sleeping in the room and left at any point since it was access to [A] that the Father sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will under limb (c).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(d) Continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    The Mother also alleged that the Father had continually harassed her and the children under limb (d). The Mother submitted that the Father’s harassing behaviour towards and the children was repeated across multiple incidents such that they constituted prolonged, persistent or sustained conduct, and even if each incident in and of itself may not be sufficient to warrant a PPO being granted, taken together, they showed a persistent course of conduct on the Father’s part to alarm and distress the Mother whenever he was upset or angry, which has caused severe and repeated anguish to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    The Mother also submitted that the Father continually harassed her with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause her anguish in the following 3 incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    The Mother alleged that sometime during her pregnancy in 2020, the Father had demanded a divorce and told ger that it would be better if she had a miscarriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    The Mother alleged that the Father threatened to forcefully bring [A] out for a picnic with his friend despite her disagreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 27 July 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    The Mother alleged that after the Father had seen her and her witnesses’ AEICs, he threatened her to “watch out” and this caused her to feel afraid and threatened by his words.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    The Mother submitted that the Father continually harassed [A] with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause him anguish in the following incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incidents from 7-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    The Mother alleged that during their overseas trip, the Father threatened [A] as follows: on 7 June 2023 when [A] could not stop crying, the Father threatened to beat him and leave him behind. On 9 June 2023 when the Father threatened to abandon [A] in the shopping street and let passers-by take [A] away when [A] would not stop crying. On 10 June 2023, when the Father threatened [A] that the maxicab driver would take him away if he did not stop crying and on 11 June 2023, when the Father threatened to leave [A] behind when he was tired and fussy at the airport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    The Mother submitted that in or around October or November 2023, the Father threatened to leave [A] at the top floor of the matrimonial flat when [A] cried when he was insecure being away from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    The Mother alleged that the Father insisted on bringing [C] to a picnic and kept shouting at the Mother who was then carrying [A] saying “Why cannot bring [C] out’. To keep [A] safe, the Mother handed [A] to his helper who brought [A] to his room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shouting/using vulgarities and slurs/insults in a hostile manner</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Towards the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    The Mother submitted in the closing submissions that the Father had caused her continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting her and relied on 15 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. She highlighted that the Husband had apologised for the incident on or around 23 August 2020, where he had used vulgar language on her and her parents, showing that he knew such behaviour would cause distress to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Towards [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    The Mother submitted that the Father had caused [A] continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting him, or shouting in his presence during 8 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Towards the Twins</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    The Mother relied on 6 incidents of the Father’s behaviour of shouting in the presence of one or both of the twins when the Father was shouting to submit that he was likely to cause or have caused continual harassment. She further stated that “considering (his) pattern of behaviour, especially how he has treated [A] who is now 4 years old, it does not require a leap of logic to see that (the Father) would also be behaving in the same hostile and harassing manner to [B] and [C], if such behaviour goes unchecked”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Hitting or throwing things/pointing aggressively/cornering or following around aggressively/intruding into a safe space</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    The Mother further submitted that the Father had caused continual harassment through 3 incidents of hitting or throwing things in the incidents in or around July 2020, 23 August 2020 and 12 February 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    She also alleged that the Father had caused her continual harassment by pointing at her aggressively during 3 incidents, namely on or around 4 May 2024, 9 May 2024 and 27 July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    Furthermore, she submitted that the Father cornered her or followed her around aggressively in 4 incidents, in or around December 2020, 9 May 2024, 22 and 23 May 2024 and 25 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    The Mother also submitted that the Father had intruded into her safe space twice during the incidents on or around 22 and 23 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    There is no legislative definition for the term, “harassment”, as it is used in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. We must therefore look to the cases which have interpreted the term “harassment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    The case of <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> (“<em>Yue Tock Him</em>”) is instructive. The District Court ruled that “harassment” means: “a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance of another person”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    Further, the conduct that is said to constitute “harassment” must be “continual” to constitute “family violence” – a single act of harassment does not, in itself, constitute “family violence”. Following from this, “not all unpleasant or annoying behaviour between two family members will, by itself, be considered as “family violence”. Only sufficiently serious and grave conduct, which are continual and sufficiently repetitive will meet the requirement (see <em>WDR v WDQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27586-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 46</a> and <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    These requirements may, at first glance, appear rather stringent to a victim of family violence. However, as the District Court explained in <em>Yue Tock Him</em>, it is necessary that the law protects against frivolous complaints that make an issue of the most trivial of matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    None of the incidents either on their own, or in totality, involve serious threat of harm to the Mother or the children. They may fairly be characterised as loud and antagonistic disagreements. However, it would be inappropriate for the Court to rule that such incidents constitute family violence, without more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    I would also add that while the Mother cited incidents spanning from 2020 to July 2024, there are clearly several breaks in continuity between the incidents. The 21 incidents that she cited as constituting harassment occurred across more than 6 years. 1 incident occurred in 2016, 4 occurred in 2020, 3 in 2021, 1 in 2022, 4 in 2023 and 7 in 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. I do not find that this demonstrated a repetitive and sustained pattern of behaviour which warranted the grant of a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    While the Father’s conduct may not have met the highest standards of husbandhood, on the totality of the incidents alleged by the Mother, even taken at its highest, I do not find that there was sufficiently serious and grave conduct by the Father, which was continual and sufficiently repetitive as to constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Necessary for the protection of a family member</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    I have found above that the Mother had not shown that family violence had not been committed under any of the limbs (a) to (d). For completeness, I will go on to state that I would also not have found that the Mother had satisfied the second limb of S 65(1) of the Women’s Charter, that it was necessary on the facts to grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a PPO is not granted. This is because a PPO is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if it is unlikely that there will be family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (<em>Yue</em>, at [64]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    Further, as the Family Court explained in <em>WLP v WLQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29626-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 10</a> at [15], the concept of “necessity” implies that there must be a measure of effectiveness to the end sought. An order that is ineffective in addressing family violence will be “extraneous to and hardly necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant”. In other words, this statutorily prescribed requirement of necessity serves as a safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the Court in family matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    The only 2 incidents cited by the Mother that allegedly involved physical harm occurred in August 2016 and then 8 years later in May 2024. I have found on the facts that no such physical harm occurred to her. All the other allegations concerned verbal disagreements that, while undoubtedly uncomfortable, do not amount to family violence. No serious incidents of physical violence or persistent harassment have been proved by the Mother. Accordingly, the granting of a PPO is not necessary in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    Specifically with regards to the children, there is currently no court order for custody, care and control and access of the children. That being the case, the Court will also be loath to intervene to issue a PPO when this may indirectly restrict or hamper the Father’s access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    It is evident that the arrival of the children to the family unit has placed tremendous strain on the Mother. She had explained in her affidavit that all their children were conceived by way of IUI and she had undergone multiple IUI attempts in 2019 and 2022 where she received more than 1,000 hormonal injections over multiple months. The Mother stated that having gone through so much just to conceive the children, their welfare was her utmost priority. The twins were born pre-mature and she was especially concerned about their physical health. She listed the sacrifices she had made for their children, such as breastfeeding [A] until he was 2 years old despite working full-time and then subsequently breastfeeding [B] and [C] until they were 8 months old, continuing to pump milk every 3 hours for the twins’ dietary needs. She also extended her maternity leave and went on part-time and flexi-work arrangements to care for the children. She also employed 2 helpers to help with caring for each of the twins. In addition, there is a third helper who cares for [A] who has stayed with the Mother’s parents since he was born, coming over to the matrimonial flat only on weekends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. I would urge the Father to seriously reflect on his behaviour and consider what made the Mother pursue this application against him. Although her application for a PPO has failed, this should not be construed as a victory for him. He should learn to control his temper and exercise more patience and care towards the Mother, failing which it may be that a PPO may be granted if the conflict between the parties does escalate in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    It is not uncommon that new parents of young children face considerable issues adapting to their new roles, and that disputes over different parenting styles and expectations may arise. It is evident that both parents love their children dearly. I encourage the Mother to accept as much help as she can from the Father in parenting the children and the Father to exercise much patience and care towards the Mother. Both the Mother and Father have a long journey of parenting ahead of them, a journey that can be both challenging and rewarding. The children are young and require all the love and support from both the Father and the Mother and I hope that they can do the best that they can for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Domestic Exclusion Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    The Mother had applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial home where they resided. As I have dismissed the Mother’s application for the PPOs, I will also dismiss her application for the DEO.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       On the 7<sup>th</sup> of October 2021, the Wife filed for divorce. Parties had managed to find common ground on the ancillary matters, and this was recorded, by way of consent, in the interim judgment. Final judgment was obtained on the 4<sup>th</sup> of February 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties marked their return to court when, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of August 2024, the Husband applied, <em>vide</em> SUM 2713/2024 (“SUM 2713”) to vary the paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of the interim judgment. This arose from a change in the care arrangements for one of the children who had relocated abroad to continue his studies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That child is currently living in a student dormitory.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In essence, the Husband seeks to vary the orders in relation to care and control of the three children of the marriage, as well as maintenance. It is in this context that the Husband has taken out his application for discovery and interrogatories <em>vide</em> SUM 3502/2024 (“SUM 3502”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 20 January 2025 on the bulklist and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       These are the items which the Husband seeks in his application for discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s payslips from April 2024 to present (Item 1);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s CPF transaction history for the past 15 months (Item 2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife’s IRAS Notices of Assessment and any other tax documents arising from any employment she may have overseas (Item 3);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife’s employment contract and/or any letters from her employer in relation to the latest change in her pay, if any (Item 4);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Monthly statements from the Wife’s bank accounts (whether sole or joint) from April 2024 to present (Item 5);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Supporting documents in relation to the Wife’s expenses for herself and the children of the marriage (from April 2024 to present) (Item 6).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As for the Husband’s application for interrogatories, these are the items sought:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A list showing the Wife’s position on expenses for Child [A] and Child [B] (Item 1);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A list showing the Wife’s position on expenses for herself (Item 2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There were two main arguments which counsel for the Wife, Ms Linda Joelle Ong (“Ms Ong”) advanced, both at the hearing before me, and in written submissions, as to why the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories should be dismissed in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       First, that there is no causative link to re-assess maintenance for all three children “on the basis of the recent change of only one child residing in Japan”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Wife argues that the Husband has no basis to seek a variation of the orders in the interim judgment, which were made by consent – and in that vein, his application in SUM 3502 must therefore be dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I cannot accept this argument. I am not the judge hearing the Husband’s application for variation in SUM 2713. It is not for me to decide, at the interlocutory stage, where the merits of that application may lie. I would also add that insofar as the Wife alleges that the Husband’s application for variation in SUM 2713 is without merit, she has not applied to strike out his application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The second argument follows a similar line of logic. Ms Ong highlighted, during the hearing, that the order which the Husband sought to vary was a consent order. Citing cases such as <em>WNF v WNG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29837-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 15</a> and <em>WWA v WWB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31572-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 33</a>, Ms Ong argued that the Husband could not discharge his burden of showing that there was a material change in circumstances which justified the court varying the maintenance order which had been recorded by way of consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It thus followed that his application for discovery and interrogatories should be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As I have explained above (at [9]), I am not hearing the substantive matters in SUM 2713, nor am I dealing with an application to strike out SUM 2713. While I can, in assessing the relevance and necessity of the items listed in the Husband’s application in SUM 3502, take into account the fact that his application in SUM 2713 is to vary a consent order, assessing whether he can demonstrate a material change in circumstances would be a bridge too far.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to consider the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories, bearing in mind the twin principles of relevance and necessity which govern such applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I start with the Husband’s request for interrogatories. There were two requests. The common thread binding them is that the Wife is asked to state her position on the expenses for two children, [A] and [B] as well as her own expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As a preliminary point, I add that the interrogatory, as framed, is rather ambiguous. It could mean either one of the following two things:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife is being asked to state her position as to what would be reasonable expenses in relation to herself, and Child [A] and [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is being asked to state her expenses, as well as that of Child [A] and Child [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     During the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Eileen Lim (“Ms Lim”), clarified that it was the latter meaning that the Husband was referring to (see [14(b)] above). However, even if one were to proceed on this basis, the interrogatory is still ambiguous because it does not specify a time period (<em>ie</em>, that the Wife is being asked to state her average monthly expenditure for the past 6 months).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Notwithstanding this, I will allow the Husband’s request for interrogatories. I am conscious of the fact that it is the Husband who is seeking to vary the orders in relation to maintenance – to that end, he not only has to convince the court that there is a material change of circumstances warranting the variation, but also the extent to which the order should be varied (see the approach taken in <em>AYM v AYL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a>). Framed this way, it is evident that the Husband’s interrogatories will certainly have a bearing on the extent to which the order should be varied. To deal with the ambiguity that I had earlier noted (above at [14]), I will order that the Wife state her average monthly expenditure, as well as that of Child [A] and [B], for the past 3 months (<em>ie</em>, November 2024 to January 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I turn now to consider the Husband’s request for discovery. The six items listed (see above at [5]) may be broadly divided into two groups: a) documents showing the Wife’s financial means (Items 1 – 5), and b) documents showing the expenses for herself and the three children (Item 6).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It must be remembered that the Husband’s application in SUM 2713 is to vary a consent order in relation to child maintenance. In that vein, it goes without saying that the obligation to maintain a child is one that is jointly shared by both parents (see <em>WFK v WFL</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 261 at [128(a)] citing <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a>). In deciding how this obligation is to be apportioned, the financial capacity of each parent is a relevant consideration. As the court in <em>WWA v WWB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31572-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 33</a> had noted (at [61] – [62]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">61    It is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments. For instance, a party who earns no income but has substantial savings or had received substantial inheritance would well be able to afford to bear a higher burden of the maintenance obligation, if reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The court should also have regard to the assets received by parties after the division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">62    As the Mother is seeking to vary the maintenance order, the burden of proving the existence of a material change in circumstances rests with her: see <em>AXM v AXO</em> [2014] 2 SLR 805 (at [31]). The Mother says that she no longer has an income or earning capacity, though this is disputed by the Father. However, even taking her case at its highest, I found that she has not discharged the burden of proof. <b>As noted above, the financial capacity of a party is not rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. The court is required to consider the party’s property and other financial resources. A party who earns no income may well have property and other financial resources that could meet his or her maintenance obligation.</b> As the Mother has not provided any evidence of her property or other financial resources, there is no basis for the court to form an accurate assessment of her financial capacity that would warrant a variation. Accordingly, I made no order on her cross-application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It follows from this that the documents which the Husband seeks in Items 1 – 5 are relevant and necessary to the hearing of SUM 2713. These documents would paint a picture as to the Wife’s financial capacity and allow the court to determine the extent to which the order should be varied (assuming that the court is indeed satisfied that there is a material change in circumstances warranting such a variation) (see <em>AYM v AYL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> generally and at [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It also follows, from the above, that the documents which the Husband seeks in Item 6 are also relevant and necessary. The documents showing the Wife’s expenses will go towards assessing her financial capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As for the proof of the children’s expenses, I do not think it can be seriously disputed that such documents are also relevant and necessary to the hearing of SUM 2713 (see <em>WFK v WFL</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 261 at [122]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, I add that I do not agree with Ms Ong’s argument in written submissions that the Father’s requests are a “blanket inquiry” into the Mother’s income and expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> As I have explained above (at [18] – [19]), these documents build a picture as to the Wife’s financial capacity and will allow the court to assess how the obligation to maintain the children should be apportioned, assuming, of course, that the court is indeed minded to vary the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request for all the items sought in discovery (see above at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In summary, the Husband’s application in SUM 3502 is allowed in its entirety, subject to the following modification I have made to the interrogatories ordered (see above at [16]). The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by 4 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing SUM 2713.

The parties had agreed to all financial matters (including maintenance), and had settled on joint custody by the time of the hearing. Both parties sought sole care and control of the child, with the Mother in particular resisting any overnight or overseas access by the Defendant Father on account of his alleged addiction to alcohol, gaming and pornography, as well as perceived inadequacies in his ability to care for the child. At the court’s behest, the Father underwent psychological assessment, which eventually ruled out safety concerns from alcohol consumption. I granted the Mother sole care and control as she has been the primary caregiver, and granted the Father one session of weekend overnight access and two sessions of weekday access, with overseas travel to be allowed from the age of six years. Additional safeguards and conditions were also imposed to address the Mother’s residual concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed this appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father and Mother married on 24 October 2014. The marriage lasted about nine years. Their daughter arrived on 9 May 2020, and they moved into their matrimonial home in December 2021, after which the relationship progressively broke down. Interim judgment was granted on 9 November 2023 by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of the hearing, the parties still resided together in their matrimonial home, although the Father had moved out of the master bedroom since the breakdown of the marriage in late September 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. They still managed to co-parent and exercised shared care over the child, with the Mother having private time with the child on Saturdays and the Father on Sundays. They had also agreed that each would have access to the child on alternating public holidays<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Both parents are working full-time. The Father’s job affords flexibility to work-from-home, whereas the Mother has to work full-time from the office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A total of 14 affidavits were filed in the present matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The parties each filed two Affidavits of Assets and Means (“AOM”), with leave granted for both to file a supplementary affidavit with regard to the Father’s alleged drinking habits during the observation period with the psychologist. The parties’ six affidavits are marked as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“MA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“FA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“MA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“FA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 3 July 2024 (“MA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 10 July 2024 (“FA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, both parties sought to bolster their cases with affidavits filed by their immediate family:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Paternal Grandmother, KBL, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGM-1” and “PGM-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Paternal Grandfather, LKH, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGF-1” and “PGF-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Paternal Uncle, LHB, filed two affidavits, on 14 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PU-1” and “PU-1” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother’s eldest sister, CWCY, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s younger sister, JWQL, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first heard parties on 11 April 2024. Given the safety concerns raised by the Mother about the Father’s alleged addiction to alcohol, I suggested and the Father agreed to attend before a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme to assess whether such concerns were founded. The psychologist was directed to tender a report thereafter, which would be open to the parties. I gave the Mother the liberty to file a supplementary affidavit restricted solely to her observations on the Father’s drinking habits from that point forward, and for the Father to have a right to reply. I also directed that no further audio or video recordings were to be made during this period, save for any incidents of loss of control due to the alleged intake of alcohol, and for parties to abstain from disparaging each other in the presence of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the next hearing on 15 July 2024, parties made further oral submissions of the psychologist’s report and their supplementary affidavits. I rendered decision with brief grounds at the hearing. Parties subsequently wrote in with further clarifications, and after a third hearing on 23 August 2024 (“the clarificatory hearing”), adjustments were made to some of the access orders. I gave leave for the time for appeal to run from this latest hearing, and the Father filed his appeal on 5 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s position was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She should have sole care and control to the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father should have daytime access only until the child reached the age of 12 or after her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), whichever is the later, and with overnight and/or overseas access to commence thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For ease of exposition, I have grouped the Mother’s arguments under eight broad headings as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Preservation of Status Quo.</b> The Mother claims she has been the primary caregiver since the child’s birth, and has maintained sole care and control over the child since the commencement of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, with the Father effectively having only daytime access to the child. Apart from a change in the residence expected in November 2024 when the matrimonial home would be sold, there would be no material change to the child’s life if she was under the Mother’s sole care, as the Mother would continue to oversee her usual schooling, enrichment and weekend routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The Mother therefore submits that sole care under her would best preserve the current status quo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Young child best placed in Mother’s care</b>. The Mother argues that a young child at the tender age of four would typically be dependent on the Mother for her welfare and psychological needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Mother has a sound parenting plan and has secondary care arrangements.</b> The Mother submits that her handling of the daily routines with the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> render her best placed to take into consideration all aspects of her well-being. The Mother’s preliminary plan is to move into her family home in Punggol, where the child has spent significant time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, has an established space for herself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, and where the Mother’s two sisters are able to provide active support if needed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The Mother has also taken care to encourage the child’s holistic development, enrolling her in Sunday school at their Church, and also enrolling her for Chinese enrichment classes. In contrast, the Mother points out that the Father’s proposed parenting plan is premised on a heavy reliance on his aged parents and brother, whose family does not have as much recent contact with the child. She claims he has never independently cared for the child overnight on his own, being relatively uninvolved in her life so far<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. She also takes the view that the Father’s interest are on his own needs and questions his commitment to caring for the child, as borne out in his messages to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Denial of allegations of alienation and abrasive parenting.</b> The Mother denies the Father’s allegations that she exercises abrasive parenting, claiming that he had taken conversations between the Mother and the child out of context<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also denies alienation on her part, pointing out that the child has not demonstrated any reluctance to spending time with the Father or his family during his weekend access time. In fact, the Mother points out that she has been taking a Therapeutic Justice approach despite the acrimonious relationship between the parties, continuing to stay in the matrimonial home and co-parenting for the sake of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <b>Lax and Hands-off Parenting.</b> According to the Mother, the Father has all along been uninvolved in the child’s daily life, and handles the child with a hands-off parenting approach, choosing to occupy the Child with the iPad or the television, instead of engaging her in more healthy activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also claims the Father exercises a laxer standard of parenting, being overly permissive of the child’s behaviour, and being unaware that the child needs boundaries and discipline at her young age<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. She submits that it would not be in the child’s interest to have such double standards in parenting at a young age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <b>Concern about the Father’s alcoholic addiction.</b> The Mother’s primary concern is the child’s safety and wellbeing during the Father’s access while she is at a tender age. She documented incidents where the Father had demonstrated a clear lack of control over his emotions and behaviour due to excessive drinking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>, and claimed that he is incapable of sober supervision over the child when he indulges himself. According to the Mother, the Father would drink multiple times a week to excess, both at home and externally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and would go on drinking sessions with his friends at least two to three times a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. When drinking at home, she observed that he would start with beer, progressing to wine and thereafter hard liquor over the course of the night, making excessive noise until he falls asleep or passes out late in the night<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. On occasions when he drank to excess, the Mother claimed that the Father was unable to coordinate his movements, and would often barge into the bedroom while inebriated to check on the child or to kiss or hug the child who was already asleep<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She also claimed he becomes aggressive and would slam things in the house whilst drunk, resulting to an incident on 22 July 2022 when she called the police<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, as well as an earlier incident on 31 December 2020 when the Father returned home in a drunk and agitated state and tried to snatch the child from her, which caused her to leave the home to stay with her sister<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Due to his drinking habits, the Mother views him as an unsafe and inappropriate caregiver for the child. She highlights for example that on 8 May 2022, she found the child sipping from an open can of beer on the Father’s study table which he had left unattended<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <b>Concern about the Father’s pornography addiction.</b> The Mother expresses concern about the Father’s addiction to pornography and his masturbatory habits. She exhibited photographs of his sex paraphernalia in a drawer and suggestive figurines which were left in accessible locations, and expressed her concern on the impact on the child should she come to view these items<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_h\"></a>(h)      <b>Concern about the Father’s gaming habits.</b> The Mother alleges that the Father spends excessive time gaming on a console connected to the living room television, in full view of the entire household. She observes that he plays games rated for “mature” audiences, which may contain graphic violence, gore, sex and nudity, as well as profanity<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On the Father’s part, he sought sole care and control of the child, or in the alternative, at least shared care and control with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I briefly summarise the Father’s arguments as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Active and hands-on father.</b> The Father claims he has been actively involved in the child’s care, including bathing, feeding, cleaning her, taking her to swimming lessons, medical and specialist appointments, as well as playing with and teaching her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. By his account, he has attended all parent-teacher conferences as well as other major activities at her pre-school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, picks her up from pre-school and communicates directly with her teachers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. He also points out that he has flexible work-from-home arrangements, allowing him to work from home most of the time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>, as compared to the Mother who is a full-time office worker, and has to outsource the child’s daytime care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>The Mother’s parenting is not in the child’s best interests.</b> The Father points to instances of what he calls aggressive parenting on the part of the Mother, for example, shouting and screaming at the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, or even confining her on one occasion when the child failed to finish her food<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. On another instance, he described how the Mother had pinned the child on the bed, and thereafter heard two slaps which he suspected were the Mother slapping the child twice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> (the Mother’s version was that the child had hit her twice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>). On 14 October 2023, the Father heard what he believed were the sounds of the Mother hitting the child, and the child repeatedly asking the Mother to say sorry to her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, although the Mother’s explanation was that it was the child who was throwing a tantrum and hitting her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Father also claims that the Mother has a tendency to taunt the child when she is misbehaving<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, which only makes the child more confused and distressed. He also disagrees with the Mother’s practice of imposing long time-outs as a punishment to correct the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Only the Father is committed to safeguarding the relationship with the other parent.</b> The Father claims that while he is committed to ensuring that the child maintains a close relationship with her Mother, he believes that the Mother would seek to diminish his relationship with the child. He raises several points in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       First, in his view, the Mother has sought to restrict his bonding time with the child, by bringing her into the master bedroom to take her morning milk<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, offering the child to watch an iPad in the master bedroom instead of interacting with the Father outside, and taking her into the master bedroom after school and shutting the door<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, thereby denying the Father the chance to partake in the child’s night time routine. He also points out that the Mother takes the child out for the entire Sunday instead of spending the weekend together<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Father also alleged that the Mother would question the child repeatedly after she had spent time with the Father and nitpick about how he looked after the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Second, the Father claims the Mother excludes him from important decisions concerning the child, such as enrolment in pre-school, enrichment classes and applying for a passport<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Third, he claims the Mother discourages bonding between father and child by making sarcastic and disparaging remarks on his efforts, for example when he reads bedtime stories to the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> or buys toys for the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, or interrupting them when they were watching television<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> or reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. He also finds bizarre her view that his giving of hugs and kisses to the child might eventually be considered inappropriate<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Fourth, he claims the Mother has on various occasions badmouthed him in the child’s presence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In contrast, the Father claims that there are multiple instances where he corrects the child for bad behaviour toward the Mother, such as when the child hit the mother, scratched the mother, bit the Mother, clawed the Mother, and poked the Mother in the eye<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. In 2023, the Father had even bought a birthday gift for the child to pass to her Mother, and reminded her to wish the Mother a happy birthday<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>The Mother falsely paints the Father as violent and a pornography addict.</b> The Father claims the Mother falsely alleges that he has committed domestic violence. For example, he cites that her allegation that he had physically forced the child to brush her teeth was not borne out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>, and points out that her police report on 22 July 2022 alleging that he had committed domestic violence toward her was false, as she had declined to undergo a medical examination and no further action was taken by the police. Next, he claims the Mother relied on false evidence to portray him as a pornography addict, by alleging that he left his sex paraphernalia in easily accessible locations<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. The Father claimed that these items were stored in a locked drawer and that she had unlocked the drawer in order to take photographs of the paraphernalia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <b>The Father has a strong familial support network compared to the Mother.</b> According to the Father, prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the paternal grandparents would drop off groceries for the child, visit at the matrimonial home on Friday and Sunday evenings and on an ad-hoc basis, and pick the child from her pre-school daily<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. This interaction was only stopped at the Mother’s request around September to October 2022, with the paternal grandparents seeing the child on Sunday evenings during the Father’s access time. The Father adds that the child is familiar with her paternal uncle and aunt (his brother)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, joining them for outings and occasionally being fetched from pre-school by her aunt. Given the Father’s intention to live with the child at his parents’ residence, where two bedrooms have been earmarked for the child and himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>, he submits that the living arrangement in his parents’ house would foster bonds within the larger family and provide additional support for the child. The Father also points out that it may not be appropriate for the Mother to rely on her two sisters for the care of the child, given that the elder sister is a habitual smoker and has an older romantic partner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <b>The Father is receptive of feedback and the Mother’s parenting concerns.</b> The Father claims that since the birth of the child, he has materially cut down his alcohol consumption and effectively stopped smoking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. He disputes the Mother’s claims that he continued his lifestyle of drinking and hanging out with his friends to the wee hours of the morning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. He also claims to have drastically cut down the time he spends playing video games<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, denies that he is addicted to gaming, and assures he would not expose the child to any inappropriate video game content<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. In any case, the Father was willing to propose a mutual undertaking that (1) there would be no consumption of alcohol in the child’s presence, (2) any sex paraphernalia would be kept out of sight from the child, (3) there would be no playing of inappropriate video games in the child’s presence, and (4) that no family violence would be committed against the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the alternative, the Father submits that if the Court is not minded to grant him sole care and control, he would request for shared care and control. He argues that it would be in the best interest of a young child to have the benefit of care from two loving parents, ensuring that both parents would fully engage in the child’s care without excluding the other. The Father points out that even after the breakdown of the marriage, the living arrangements were akin to shared care and control, and it would be in the best interests of the child to preserve the status quo in their living arrangements (see <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> [F2BOA Tab 26]). In particular, on weekday mornings, the Father would participate in the child’s morning routine, after the Mother takes her to pre-school. Upon the child’s return, the parties would take turns to care for the child, including bathing her, playing with her and reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. On weekends, while the child is at home in the morning or after dinner at night, both parties would take turn to care for her and participate in her bedtime routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, the Father points out that this is not a case where the parties hold intractable hostility against each other, as they could continue to live together and managed to agree on the reasons for divorce as well as the financial issues in the Ancillary Matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Should the Father fail to obtain sole or shared care, he proposes access over two weekdays, with an additional weekday when the child turns six years of age. He also took the view that he should be granted weekend overnight access immediately when parties move out of the matrimonial home. He reiterates he is a hands-on and involved parent, and has drastically reduced his alcohol consumption and intends to be in good health so he can provide for his child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. In any event, even if the Mother still had concerns, overnight access would take place in the paternal grandparents’ residence where there were additional hands to support the Father as needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father also submitted for half of school holiday access, and for overseas access to commence immediately, with permission to take two short trips of up to seven days each year. After entering primary school, he wishes to have overseas access during his half of the school holidays, subject to the usual orders in relation to the provision of travel itinerary, accommodation and flight details, contact numbers and the handing over of the passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allegations of Alcohol, Pornography and Gaming Addictions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The primary objection that the Mother raised against the Father’s care was her view that his alleged addictions presented a safety threat to the child. While I appreciated the Mother’s protective instincts in relation to the child, I will explain why I did not find sufficient evidence of safety risks that would justify a restriction of only daytime access between the Father and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To address the concern about alcoholic addiction, at the suggestion of the Court, the Father voluntarily underwent a series of sessions with a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme. Dr Matthew Woo, a private psychologist of 20 years’ experience who was previously the lead psychologist at the Department of Forensic Psychiatry under the Institute of Mental Health, saw the Father over seven sessions from 26 April 2024 to 21 June 2024 (“the observation period”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In Dr Woo’s report dated 15 July 204, he noted that the Father admitted that he consumed alcohol an average of three times a week, with two to three glasses of alcohol per session, over the previous three years. Dr Woo noted that this was at the borderline of the minimum criteria set by the Health Promotion Board of no more than two standard drinks a day for men. Crucially, Dr Woo observed that over the observation period, the Father had not shown any signs of alcohol use, let alone alcohol dependence. He noted that the Father had taken alcohol-free beer as a substitute for alcohol, and attained very healthy breath analyser readings of 0.000% BAC in his self-conducted tests after psychological treatment began on 26 April 2024. In the course of therapy, the Father had reported four trigger situations which would give him the urge to drink alcohol, namely taking meals which included sashimi, salmon or cheese, as well as stressful situations at the workplace which would give him headaches. Dr Woo shared that these urges were processed with Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR), and noted the Father’s persistence in reducing or desensitising his urges to drink to a zero rating for these triggers. At the end of the observation period, Dr Woo therefore concluded that the Father’s behaviour at home was not under any influence of alcohol, and that there “is simply no evidence of safety issues with respect to child custody”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In her supplementary affidavit, the Mother nevertheless expressed the view that the Father’s dependency on non-alcoholic substitute drinks belied his persistent emotional association with alcohol, and opined that he may not be able to resist such cravings beyond the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. She also voiced her suspicion that the Father had disposed of glass bottles and cans furtively in the night, and suggests that he could have consumed alcohol outside of the home on the 14 nights during the observation period where was either staying at his parents’ home or on an overseas trip<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>. She also notes that the Father had repeatedly attempted to moderate his drinking throughout the marriage, but would fail and lapse into uncontrollable alcoholic binges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. She thus had serious doubts about the sustainability of his efforts during the observation period, and feared that once the scrutiny of court proceedings was over, he would revert to his long-held drinking habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In his supplementary affidavit, the Father explained that after the first hearing on 11 April 2024, he had disposed of whatever alcohol was in the home and had turned off his wine chiller. He had also started taking frequent breathalyser tests with accompanying video footage, the results of which showed he had zero alcohol content on his breath<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. He submitted that his switch to non-alcoholic beers was testament to his determination to change his behaviour, and he denied the Mother’s accusations that he was hiding his drinking habits during the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     On balance, I accepted Dr Woo’s opinion that the Father had not shown signs of alcohol consumption, and certainly did not present any safety risk over the course of the observation period. The Mother’s doubts as to whether the Father was still consuming alcohol over this period are speculatory and I am unable to ascribe weight to her views. As to whether there may be safety risks that may arise after the scrutiny of therapy and court proceedings is over, I do note that even when the Father had drunk to excess in the past and exhibited allegedly aggressive behaviour at home, there was never any proof that such aggression was directed against the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     To allay this residual concern on the Mother’s part, I directed that the Father take a breath analyser test before each session of access for the next six months and to preserve a photo record of such test results with the appropriate date and time stamp. These records need not be shared with the Mother and should be retained by the Father for a further six months from the point of the test. The purpose of this procedure is to assure parties that in the event of any future incident or further court proceeding, these records may be made available as evidence. This was intended to provide practical deterrence to ensure the Father abstains from alcohol, without presenting an unreasonable imposition on his privacy and dignity. With the Father’s recent efforts and this practical safeguard in place, I did not think the issue of his past alcoholic consumption would detract from his ability to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Turning to the concern about the Father’s possession of sexual paraphernalia, I note that there was no actual incident where the child had been exposed to the Father’s collection of objects. There was also no suggestion that the Father had behaved inappropriately in any way with his daughter. With regard to the Mother’s expressed concern about the Father hugging and kissing the child, I did not find these to be anything other than normal expressions of parental love towards a young child. I accordingly think that an undertaking as proposed by the father to keep any sexual paraphernalia away from the view of the child would sufficiently address the Mother’s concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, on the issue of gaming addiction, I likewise took the view that an undertaking that no age-inappropriate gaming would take place in the presence of the child would address this concern. The Father would be well aware that any breach of this undertaking would be easily shared by the child with the Mother, which should provide sufficient deterrence against such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For these reasons, I did not find the allegations relating to various addictions to be sufficient cause to restrict the Father to only daytime access with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Sole Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I turn next to the opposing positions on which parent should be granted sole care and control over the child. It is axiomatic that when exercising the power under s 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to place the child in the care and control of either or both parents, the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child (per s 125(2)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is also trite that where all factors are equal between the parties, greater weight is ascribed to the maternal bond between a mother and an infant child. In the oft-cited case of <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>, the Court of Appeal held, in regard to a four-year old child, that a child at a tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs, at [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All other things being equal, a very important factor to bear in mind was that we were dealing with an extremely young infant. We felt that the maternal bond between the appellant and the infant was a pivotal consideration here. The bond between the natural mother and her child is one of the most unexplainable wonders of human nature. It should never be taken for granted or slighted…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In <em>Chan Kah Cheong Kenneth v Teoh Kheng Yau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 2 SLR(R) 0595.xml')\">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 595</a>, MPH Rubin J held that, if all the factors were equal between the parties, then probably it was right for a child of tender years to be brought up by his natural mother. We should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. It is only a natural conclusion that, by reason of his very tender, young age, the infant would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The significance of the maternal bond was earlier highlighted as a relevant factor in determining the issue of care and control in <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>, where the Court of Appeal held at [22] and [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22.    We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these: (a) the conduct of the parties; (b) the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion; <b>(c) a young child would be best looked after by its mother</b>; (d) which party can offer better security and stability; and (e) that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The significant weight to be given to the maternal bond is bolstered in this case by the fact that the Mother has been and remains the primary caregiver of the child. While the Father has made effort to participate actively in the child’s daily routine, it is clear that he is not the parent in charge of the child’s daily welfare. The notion of primary caregiving is not just one of effort or contribution, but rather which parent places the greatest time, energy and priority of the child over and above his or her own personal needs. There is no doubt in my mind that the Mother places the greatest priority on and has the closer bond with the child, and ranks the welfare and developmental needs of the child above her own. Coupled with the importance of preserving the maternal bond for a young child, this factor clearly shifts the issue of sole care in the Mother’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The next factor I considered in deciding the issue of care and control is which party offers better stability and security for the child. Both residential arrangements put forth by the parents, i.e. the Mother’s family home and the home of the paternal grandparents, provide familiarity and continuity to the child. Both households also have family members able to support and step in to assist with the management of the child. Despite certain aspersions cast against each parents’ family members, I did not find there to be any negative factors which militated against the choice of either household. Accordingly, I considered this to be an equally balanced factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I turn next to parenting style and capability. Much ink has been spilled in a running diatribe between the parties on how the other’s parenting techniques are deficient or even dangerous. Such disagreements are not uncommon even in healthy marriages, where fathers are sometimes perceived to be overly permissive, hands-off and insufficiently attentive, while mothers are critiqued for being overly strict, over-protective or overbearing in relation to the upbringing of the child. I say this not to trivialise the validity of such differences of opinion, but to highlight that differing parenting methods and approaches are par for the course, and that it is incumbent for parties to come to terms on a course best suited to the particular characteristics of their child. By all accounts, the child in this case does appear to have some issues with discipline, and acts out against the controlling parent when she does not get her way. While the Father critiques the Mother for being high-handed in disciplining the child, the reality is that parenting can be exasperating even for the most temperate of parents, and I did not find that the Mother had reacted out of line whenever the child acted up against her. On the other hand, I did not agree with the Mother that the Father’s permissive parenting style was necessarily deficient. In truth, a combination of differing parenting styles may be workable and even beneficial in the co-parenting process. It is not uncommon that a child abides by the disciplinary parent and seeks levity and respite with the relaxed parent. Accordingly, despite the minutiae of criticisms levied between the parties, I did not find either parenting style to be detrimental to the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As for parenting capability, it is clear in my view that the Mother is more involved and committed to the care of the child than the Father, having been the primary caregiver since the birth of the child. While the Father has contributed significantly to and has been actively involved in the child’s care, he has never been <em>solely</em> responsible for the child’s welfare for protracted periods of time. In this regard it is clear that the Mother is the far stronger candidate for sole care and control as compared to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, the Father also argued that care should devolve to him due to significant gatekeeping behaviour on the part of the Mother, which would undermine the viability of any terms of access. While it is true that care and control may go to the parent who was more facilitative and reasonable about access (per <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> at [45]), I did not find the Mother guilty of alienation or gatekeeping in any true sense of the word. Quite to the contrary, the very fact that the Mother continued to stay in the matrimonial home until it was sold, and was willing to allow the Father a full day of weekend access to the child in the interim, was telling of her willingness to cooperate with the Father for the sake of the child. This factor was accordingly not helpful to the Father’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Having considered all the above factors, I was of the view that the decision on sole care and control should weigh heavily in favour of the Mother, given the significance of the maternal bond and her role as the primary caregiver of the child since birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Before coming to a final decision, I also considered the Father’s alternative proposition for shared care and control. In considering whether an order for shared care and control would be in the best interest of the child, the court would consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind her age and personality, to live in two homes (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father points out that the parties are able to effectively co-parent at present, and that shared care would essentially be a preservation of the status quo, which would in the usual circumstance be the best choice for preserving the stability of the welfare of the child (per <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, at [34]). However, I would point out that the current arrangement where the child lives with both parents cannot be continued because the matrimonial home is due for sale. A regime of shared care would therefore not be a preservation of the status quo. With shared care, the child would need to transition to an arrangement where she spent equal time between two homes, one in Punggol and the other in River Valley. She would also have to alternate between two different extended families, with wholly different parenting values, habits and expectations, which may only diverge more markedly over time as the parents lead their separate lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While it is true that a young child who has yet to commence formal education may be more suited to a shared care and control arrangement (per <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [109], and <em>UPK v UPL <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22321-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 92</a></em> at [26]), the reality is that it would be a significant adjustment for the child to spend equal time between two extended families which would have equal control and influence over her life. I am not convinced how this would be beneficial rather than disruptive to the child’s life. On the other hand, maintaining the Mother as the sole caregiver would provide a measure of stability and security to the child that would mitigate the disruption brought about by the divorce. The child would still preserve her bond with her Father if sufficient latitude is given to him for access. I therefore declined to order shared care and control as proposed by the Father, and granted the Mother sole care and control over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overnight Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given my earlier reasoning that the Mother’s concerns of safety regarding the Father’s alleged addictions was not borne out, I did not find any reason to deny the Father overnight access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Indeed, the Court should be slow to deny a parent overnight access, given the benefits that extended access brings to the development of the parent-child bond (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [29]-[30]). I note too that the age of the child in itself is not a strong reason for allowing or denying the other parent overnight access (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> at [32]). The importance of overnight access was succinctly explained by District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang in <b><em>VZP v VZQ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27068-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 8</a> at [25] in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Child should be equally entitled to overnight access with the father as he is with the mother, unless there is evidence to disprove either party’s eligibility, such as a history of abusive or negligent parenting. Even though the Children are asleep during a part of the overnight access, there is an intangible value of building up familiarity, being able to say good morning to or to have a particular storybook read by the parent before the Children go to bed, these are important opportunities to build bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I was therefore minded to allow one session of overnight weekend access to the Father each week, from 9 pm on Saturday to 9 pm on Sunday. This would enable both parents to have an equal share of weekend time, while ensuring that the child returned home with sufficient leeway to settle down before the weekday routine began.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     To ensure that the child receives the best care possible, and also mindful that the Father has not been in sole care of the child for an extended period of time, I added the condition that the child is to reside at the home of the Father’s parents during such overnight access, as their support would be especially helpful in the management of a child at a tender age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the clarificatory hearing, the Father requested for the Mother to drop off the child for his weekend access on Saturday 9 pm at the paternal grandparents’ house in River Valley. The Mother objected as her routine involved attending church at Suntec City in the evening followed by dinner nearby from 7.30 pm to 8.30 pm, which would either be at the same location or near Raffles City or Dhoby Ghaut MRT. As the Mother did not drive, it would be difficult for her to send the child to River Valley thereafter. Given that the Father drives and for the benefit of the young child’s welfare, I directed that the child be picked up for handover at Suntec City (save where there are road closures in any part of town), Dhoby Ghaut MRT or Raffles City, and for the Mother to inform the Father of the exact location at least one hour beforehand. The Mother then sought the limitation that the pickup be done by the Father alone, as the grandparents were elderly and may be unable to handle the child’s temper tantrums. I did not think it necessary to impose this limitation on the Father, when there was no evidence of inability to manage the child on the part of the paternal grandparents. I did however refine the direction to specify that the pickup of the child should be restricted to immediate family members only (i.e. excluding a domestic helper or some other third party), given the young age of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Finally, to forestall future disputes regarding the use of weekend time for external activities, I directed that the allocation of time for co-curricular and enrichment activities should fall equally between each parent’s period of weekend access, with any excess allocation to be subject to agreement by both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Weekday Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Turning to weekday access, I granted the Father access to the child over two weekday evenings on Wednesday and Thursday, from the time the child is picked up from childcare or school to 8:30 pm. At the clarificatory hearing, the Mother requested for a change of days to Tuesday and Thursday, as she wished to undertake volunteering activities for the purposes of future primary school application on Tuesday. The Father objected to this as he would be tied up with work on Tuesday. As the Father’s commitment appeared more immutable, I declined the Mother’s request to amend the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, to afford flexibility, I directed that should access not be practicable on any given session, the Father should in the alternative be granted video access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     As agreed by parties, the sessions of access would also be subject to the undertakings of both parties not to consume alcohol, play age-inappropriate video games or expose the child to any sexually inappropriate objects during the period of care over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overseas Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As for overseas access, I repeat my earlier observation that the Father had hitherto not taken sole charge of the child for a protracted period of time. I was of the view that overseas access should be introduced in a staggered fashion, with a requirement of accompaniment by either the paternal grandparents or the paternal aunt from the age of six to nine years of age. After the age of nine years, the Father should be able to take the child for overseas access alone, as the child would be more mature and the Father would have more experienced in the exclusive care of the child. Accordingly, the following directions were made regarding overseas access by the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Overseas access with the Father commences when the child reaches 6 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such access should be for no more than 7 days at a time, and shall not exceed two times a year without the consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any overseas access should also be in the company of either parent of the Father or the sister-in-law of the Father, until the child reaches the age of 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The exact dates of such overseas access should be notified no less than one month in advance to the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The passport of the child is to be handed over seven days before the commencement of travel and returned seven days after the conclusion of travel. At the clarificatory hearing, an additional condition was added that neither party should withhold consent to renew the passport without reasonable cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Each parent should have daily video access to the child when the child is travelling with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_g\"></a>(g)     For the avoidance of doubt, overseas trips take priority over regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father also sought clarification whether a staycation would be allowed for his overnight access prior to the child turning six years of age. Mindful that overnight access was ordered to be at the paternal grandparent’s residence to ensure that the Father was well-supported while the child was young, I declined to allow staycations prior to the age of six years old. I would however leave it to parties to exercise reason within the spirit of the order, for e.g. if the paternal grandparents were to join the overnight staycation, I would not see any reason why such a variation should not be acceded to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other Access Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With regard to school holidays, a similar stepped-up approach was applied. Once the child commences primary school, the Father would have additional daytime access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, with the school holidays equally shared once the child turns nine years of age. This accords with the earlier reasoning that the Father should enjoy greater access once there was greater familiarity over the child’s care, at an age when the child is more mature and independent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The following is a summary of the orders made regarding public and school holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Public holiday access is to alternate between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During school holidays when the child commences primary school, the Father shall additionally have access on Weds and Thurs from 10 am to 8.30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the child turns nine years of age, school holiday access is to be equally shared (which will include overnight access). The Father will be granted access for the first half of any school holiday in the first and odd years of every calendar year, and will be granted the second half of the school holiday in even years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties suggested that there be video call access every other evening from 5.30 to 6.00 pm during uninterrupted periods of access. I agreed and so directed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For each parent’s birthday, as well as Mother’s and Father’s Day, the respective parent would have access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, and this would supersede any other direction on regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On the child’s birthday access, the parent without access on that day would be granted two hours of access with the child, with the exact hours of access to be agreed between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_g\"></a>(g)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties also agreed that if for any reason a period of access would fall under one hour, there would be no need for the other parent to hand over the child for this short period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On the issue of costs, I considered that while both sides did not fully prevail in their arguments before the Court, the final outcome was more aligned with what counsel revealed to be the Father’s without prejudice offer. Accordingly, I directed that costs of $1,500 (all-in) be paid by the Mother to the Father.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\"

They had a son and a daughter, who were born in February 2011 and in March 2012 respectively. By 2018, the marriage had fallen apart. In December 2021, these divorce proceedings were commenced. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in May 2022 on the ground that each spouse had behaved in a manner that made it intolerable for the other to continue to live with him or her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Despite the differences that led to this divorce, the spouses continued to co-parent their children. They agreed to share the custody of the children. They also agreed that the wife was to have care and control of the children and that the husband was to have access to the children each week, on public holidays and other special occasions, and during the children’s school vacations. This cooperation between the spouses was heartening, and these arrangements recorded in order of court dated August 2022 that was made with the consent of the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the spouses on the remaining ancillary matters, which were the division of the matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the wife and the children. I divided the matrimonial assets 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband. I also ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200 and the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife is dissatisfied with my decisions on the division of the matrimonial assets other than the matrimonial home and on the maintenance for the children. I now provide my reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32465-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 34</a> at [43], the division of matrimonial assets implicates a 4-stage process. First, the identification of the matrimonial assets. Second, the valuation of those matrimonial assets. Third, the determination of the contributions of the spouses to the acquisition of those matrimonial assets. Fourth, the fair apportionment of the matrimonial assets between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Identification and valuation of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I began by identifying and valuing the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in joint names</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matrimonial home was the only asset that the spouses held jointly. The wife is not challenging my decision on the division of the matrimonial home and is challenging on my decision on the division of the other assets. Still, for completeness, and because I had examined all the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home globally), I set out my decision on it briefly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The value of the matrimonial home as a matrimonial asset was the difference in the market price of the matrimonial home and the outstanding amount on the loan that had been taken for the purchase of the matrimonial home. The wife submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $889,000. The husband submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $819,000. In the absence of better evidence on the market value of the matrimonial home and given the relatively small difference between the values put forward by the parties, I took the middle of these two values (<em>ie</em>, $854,000) as the market value of the matrimonial home. The spouses agreed that the outstanding loan on the matrimonial home was $415,736. Accordingly, the value of the matrimonial home in the pool of matrimonial assets was therefore $479,124.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in name of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I set out the assets in the name of the wife and the values that each spouse ascribed to each of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"61.26%\"><col width=\"19.36%\"><col width=\"19.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Central Provident Fund Balances</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">UOB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">POSB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tencent (400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Xiaomi (3,400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Monies Withdrawn</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">148,625</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Sub-Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>64,899</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>213,524</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The spouses agreed that the wife had Central Provident Fund balances of $29,739, a UOB Bank Account with $6,262, a POSB Bank Account with $1,954, 400 Tencent shares with a value of $21,080, and 3,400 Xiaomi shares with a value of $5,864.

Once a marriage had broken down, any substantial sum expended by a spouse other than for daily or run-of-the-mill expenses had to be returned to the asset pool if the monies would otherwise have been matrimonial assets and the other spouse had not consented to the expenditure. Regardless of whether the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate the monies, or for the benefit of children or relatives, the spouse who made the expenditure had to be prepared to bear it personally and in full (see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31318-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 11</a> at [43] and [49] citing <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was therefore incumbent on the wife to account for the $148,625 as run-of-the-mill expenses and/or show that the husband had consented to the expenditures in question (see <em>WJG v WJH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29111-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 28</a> at [29(c)]). Beyond bare assertions that the monies had been spent on the family, however, the wife offered little explanation for the expenditure. Although it was unsurprising that objective or documentary evidence may not have been available to bear out every expenditure in a family, the absence of such evidence to support even the larger withdrawals cast doubt on the credibility of explanations of the wife for the withdrawals as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I set out the notable withdrawals for which the objective evidence did not bear out and/or sat inconsistently with the claims of the wife on them:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife withdrew $15,000 between February and March 2020 and suggested that she had done so to support herself and the children when they moved out of the matrimonial home after the marriage had broken down. But neither the wife nor the children did in fact move out of the matrimonial home, and they continued to reside in the matrimonial home even at the time of these proceedings. Further, it was not in dispute that the husband had supported the family and paid for the outgoings of the household during the marriage, even after the wife had purported to move out of the matrimonial home. This left little need for the wife to withdraw monies to support herself and the children over and beyond that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The wife withdrew $16,000 in April 2022 and suggested that she had much of these monies had been spent on course fees of $19,227 for a master’s degree for herself. But these course fees had been paid in two tranches – of $8,471 and $10,756 – with the latter due only in November 2022. And the wife offered no explanation for why she had made a withdrawal in April 2022 to meet course fees that were due over six months thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife withdrew $20,000 in July 2022 to repay a loan from one “Texas Lee”. But there was no documentary evidence in support of any liability by the wife to pay such a sum. This absence of documentation of the liability was particularly surprising given the relatively large quantum of this expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The wife withdrew $13,000 in December 2021, and $12,485 across July and August 2022 and claimed that part of the monies went to paying her legal expenses, ostensibly for these divorce proceedings. But legal fees for divorce proceedings should in principle be paid out of the payor’s share of the matrimonial assets and not the pool of matrimonial assets in general (see <em>WUA v WUB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31018-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 10</a> at [8]).

husband were not in dispute, whether as to the identity of the assets or the value of the assets. The only assets over which the spouses diverged were 475 shares in Meta Platforms, Inc, a time deposit account in OCBC Bank that the husband held jointly with his mother, and the proceeds of the sale of shares in a business called “[PB]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The spouses agreed that 475 Meta shares in the name of the husband were matrimonial assets. But they diverged over the date at which those shares were to be valued. The wife submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, when these shares were worth $309,415. The husband submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the interim judgment in May 2022, when these shares were worth only $76,090. In <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> (“<em>VQF</em>”) at [1], the Family Division of the High Court observed that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets, save for money account balances, was the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, because that date would facilitate the use of the most up-to-date values in ascertaining the economic fruits of the marriage. The husband asserted that the four-fold increase in the value of the Meta shares should accrue solely to him because it was his decision to hold the shares beyond the date of the interim judgment that produced the increase in the value of the shares. But there was little evidence to show, as of the date of the interim judgment, that the husband was assuming solely for himself rather than for the matrimonial pool the consequences of holding the Meta shares beyond that date. Without such evidence, there was little reason to depart from the position in <em>VQF</em>. The date for valuing the 475 Meta shares was thus the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. At that date, these shares had a value of $309,415.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It was also not in dispute that there was a time deposit with OCBC Bank in the names of the husband and his mother that had a monetary balance of $134,800. The wife submitted that this value was to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband, however, claimed that he had made no contributions to and had no beneficial interest in this time deposit or the monies therein. In support of this claim, the husband adduced an affidavit deposed by his mother in which she repeated the claim of the husband. But the husband as a joint owner of the bank account was entitled to the undivided whole of the monies in that account. On the face of his legal ownership of the account, the monies therein were matrimonial assets. Insofar as the husband asserted that he had no beneficial interest in the account, it was incumbent on him to obtain a determination from the civil courts to that effect because the Family Justice Courts were unable to adjudicate on a claim by a third party to a putative matrimonial asset (see <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]). But there was no such determination before me. Beyond the bare and self-serving assertions of the husband and his mother, there was no evidence to show that, despite the legal interest of the husband in that account, he had no beneficial interest in the monies in that account. I thus included that account in the pool of matrimonial assets and valued it at $134,800.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It finally appeared that the husband had received approximately $20,000 from the [PB] business. He had received this sum in two tranches, which were a fortnight apart, in September 2021, which was shortly before these divorce proceedings were commenced in December 2021. Scant explanation was offered to account for these monies. In my view, these monies were matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Adding the values of the Meta shares ($309,415), the OCBC Time Deposit ($134,800), and the proceeds of the sale of the [PB] business shares ($20,000) to the other assets in the name of the husband, the total value of the assets in the name of the husband was $927,175.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on my findings above, the pool of matrimonial assets comprised $479,124 in assets in the joint names of the spouses, $213,524 in assets in the sole name of the wife, and $927,175 in assets in the sole name of the husband. The value of the pool of matrimonial assets thus totalled $1,619,825.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The exercise of dividing matrimonial assets sought to fairly apportion the economic fruits of the marriage between the spouses by duly recognising their breadwinning and homemaking contributions to the marriage, in line with the philosophy that marriage was an equal partnership (see <em>TNL</em> at [45]). Two different approaches applied based on the nature of the breadwinning and homemaking arrangements in the marriage. In general, the “structured” approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a> (<em>“ANJ</em>”) was used, whereunder the court ascertained ratios representing: (a) the spouses’ direct contributions to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets; and (b) the spouses’ indirect contributions to the welfare of the family. These two ratios would then be averaged and necessary adjustments to the weightage of each ratio could be made to reach a fair and just division of the matrimonial assets. But the <em>ANJ</em> approach would not be applied in long single-income marriages because it over-recognised the financial contributions of the breadwinner and under-recognised the non-financial contributions of the homemaker. Instead, the division exercise in such circumstances tended to centre on the indirect contributions of the homemaking spouse, and the weight to be ascribed to these indirect contributions would be broadly proportional to the length of the marriage. Hence, the final ratios of division ranged from 50:50 (in long single-income marriages of 25–35 years’ duration) to 75:25 in favour of the breadwinner (in shorter single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (“<em>BOR</em>”) at [111]–[113] were instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">111    … In <em>TNL v TNK</em>, this court observed that the trend in long single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but different considerations may attach to short single-income marriages (at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <em>TNL v TNK</em> itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112    The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <em>TNL v TNK</em>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">113    We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <em>ATT v ATS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0859.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 859</a> at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <em>UGG v UGH (m.w.)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 25</a>, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <em>ABX v ABY and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0969.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 969</a>, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nevertheless, as the Family Division of the High Court cautioned in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a>, a litigant could not focus excessively on categorising a marriage as one that was single-income or dual-income. Rather, the court was ultimately guided by the philosophy that a marriage was an equal partnership, and equal and sufficient recognition had to be paid to both breadwinning and homemaking contributions. The power of dividing matrimonial assets would therefore be exercised in broad strokes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This caution was apposite in these proceedings, where the wife had worked periodically for a total duration of approximately a year within the 11-year marriage. At the time of these proceedings, too, the wife was actively looking for employment and had found employment by the conclusion of these proceedings. Still, the wife submitted that the <em>TNL</em> approach for long single-income marriages should apply,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that she should be awarded 50% of the matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> But given the relatively short duration of the marriage, one year of work by the wife was not insubstantial. This marriage therefore did not fit squarely within the <em>TNL</em> framework for long single-income marriages. The structured approach in <em>ANJ</em> was thus, by default, the appropriate one to take.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The husband, who was a breadwinner throughout the marriage, paid for the matrimonial home that had a value of $479,124 and the matrimonial assets in his name that had a value of $927,175. The wife, who worked for a year during the marriage, financed the matrimonial assets in her name that had a value of $213,524. The ratio of the direct contributions of the spouses was thus 87:13 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For the indirect contributions of the spouses, the marriage had lasted 11 years and the wife had been the primary caregiver to the two children throughout the marriage. The husband, who was the primary breadwinner, travelled regularly for work. Yet he paid the expenses of the household, oversaw the acquisition and fitting out of the matrimonial home, and engaged domestic helpers to assist the wife with her homemaking. As the husband submitted, these indirect contributions of his helped the wife with her homemaking and freed her to obtain educational qualifications including a diploma and a master’s degree, as well as pursue full-time jobs (albeit for limited periods of time). On balance, a fair apportionment of the indirect contributions of the spouses was 60:40 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Fair and equitable division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Taking the average of the ratios of the direct and indirect contributions of the spouses, the final ratio was 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The wife urged me to award her at least a 5% uplift in this final ratio by drawing an adverse inference against the husband for a lack of full and frank disclosure of his assets. She claimed that he had provide piecemeal responses to her applications for discovery and interrogatories and had been less than candied on his transactions especially in relation to his OCBC Time Deposit and his investment in the [PB] business. But the disclosure provided by the husband in discovery and interrogatories, even if occasionally piecemeal, was generally complete. Further, it was more principled, given that the values of the OCBC Time Deposit and the proceeds from the [PB] business shares were known, to add those values to the pool of matrimonial assets rather than to provide an impressionistic uplift to the final ratio of division in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I thus awarded the wife a 36.5% share of the $1,619,825 pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, if this marriage were classified, as submitted by the wife, as a single-income marriage, the approach in <em>TNL</em> would apply. Thereunder, given the 11-year length of the marriage, the wife would likely have received 25-30% of the pool of matrimonial assets. This would have been less favourable for the wife than the 36.5% share of the pool of matrimonial assets that she would receive pursuant to the structured approach in <em>ANJ</em>. But given that the purpose of the <em>TNL</em> approach (as an exception to the default <em>ANJ</em> approach) was to provide due recognition to the homemaking contributions in single-income marriages, it would be justified to grant the wife, who was the primary homemaker here, the more generous of the awards under the TNL approach and the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Accordingly, I awarded her 36.5% of the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the time of these proceedings, the husband and the wife were each approximately 50 years of age. The husband earned a monthly income of $10,737. The wife earned a monthly income of $3,500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For wife maintenance, the wife had earned a monthly income of $6,600 before the divorce, had lost that employment thereafter, and had found work only during the hearing of the ancillary matters at a monthly income of $3,500. It was commendable that the wife had made efforts to find such gainful employment, because the law encouraged former wives to seek employment to defray their personal expenses and contribute to preserve their pre-divorce lifestyles and standards of living (see <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5771-M.xml')\">[1995] SGHC 23</a> at [21]–[22] and <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [13]). Still, the difference between the monthly income of the wife before and after the divorce was substantial. It was thus just to have the husband contribute to the reasonable expenses of the wife while she found her feet after the divorce. Taking account of the not insubstantial share of the matrimonial assets that the wife would receive, I ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For child maintenance, the wife sought a monthly sum of $3,250 for each child and asked that the husband further “bear the children’s mandatory education expense including school fees, school trips and any extra lessons and/or programs organized by the school”. She added that the maintenance should be payable until the children complete their tertiary education and attain their first tertiary degree.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The husband proposed monthly figures of child maintenance of $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     At the outset, I found it unjustified at this juncture to have the husband maintain the children beyond the age of 21 years, which was the age upon which child maintenance obligations terminate unless otherwise ordered by the court (see s 69(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). The children were 13 and 11 years of age respectively. There was no certainty that they would be pursuing education beyond 21 years of age. As the Family Court in <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> observed at [10]–[12], maintenance catered to present and certain financial needs and not potential or uncertain aspirational wants. Absent certainty that the children would be pursing tertiary education, it would be unjustified to order maintenance to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the quantum of maintenance, the wife offered no breakdown for how each child spent $3,250 per month. Instead, she tabulated a detailed list of what she called “nocturnal activities” on the part of the husband then demanded that he put up $6,500 each month for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She appeared to premise her claim for $3,250 per child per month on the basis that the husband should be fully responsible for maintaining the children because he had a higher earning capacity than her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The husband, on his part, likewise offered few specifics on the expenses of each child beyond asserting that $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter comprised 62% of the reasonable expenses of each of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Based on the submissions of the spouses, the following expenses of the children were not in dispute:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Student care: $245 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School transport: $123 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Pocket money: $160 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Over and above these sums, the wife justified her claims for child maintenance on the basis that the children attended tuition and incurred expenditures on “daily living necessities such as food and grocery expenses, transportation costs, personal care, clothing and other miscellaneous needs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> For tuition, in particular, the wife submitted that the son incurred $1,434 each month while the daughter incurred $450 each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As between the submissions of the husband and the wife on child maintenance, I found the submissions of the husband more credible. Even as neither spouse provided detailed breakdowns of the expenses of each child, the submissions of the wife were more difficult to accept for three reasons. First, she claimed that the reasonable expenses of each child were the same when, on her own calculations, the son spent approximately $1,000 more than the daughter on tuition each month and the other expenses of each child were broadly similar. Second, on the calculations of the wife, the daughter would be spending over $2,000 each month just on food and groceries, clothing, and other miscellaneous needs, which estimate was objectively high. Third, the wife appeared to premise her claim for child maintenance on the basis that the husband should maintain the children solely when the maintenance of children is a joint parental responsibility and she was not without earning capacity. Indeed, at the time of these proceedings, the wife was seeking work at the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I thus preferred the estimates of the husband as to the reasonable expenses of the children and his proposals to pay $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter each month. The maintenance of the children was a joint parental responsibility, and the wife was not without financial resources to play her part in discharging that responsibility given the not insignificant amount of matrimonial assets that she would receive as well as the employment income that she had recently secured. Still, the wife would, even when she secured employment, require some time to settle into a breadwinning role after serving as a homemaker for much of the marriage. I thus ordered the husband to maintain the children in amounts that were slightly higher than those that he had put forward. The husband was thus to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I thus made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of, was to be divided in the proportions of 62.5% to the husband and 36.5% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband was to maintain the wife in the monthly sum of $200 for two years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband was to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I made no order on the costs of these proceedings.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>2WAOM at [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [39]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [56]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE 25/10/24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [85]–[89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [72]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Dissipation of shares"],"date":"2025-02-10","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 228 of 2023","title":"XIM v XIN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 17","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32846-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chan Eng Jin, Darren (Zeng Yongren, Darren) and David Zhang (Legal Aid Bureau) for the plaintiff","Lim Hong Wen, Amelia and Low Seow Ling (Liu Xiaolin) (Emre Legal LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-17T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Marcus Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XIM v XIN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XIM <em>v</em> XIN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32846-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 17</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Plaintiff filed her Writ for Divorce on 16 January 2023. The interim judgment was granted on 12 April 2023 (the “IJ”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff was 53 years old at the time of hearing. The Defendant was 63 years old. There were no children of the marriage, although the Plaintiff had two adult children from his previous marriage and the Defendant had one adult child from her previous marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The ancillary matters came up before me for hearing on 19 September 2024. I delivered my decision on 25 October 2024. The only issues for my determination were the division of the matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance. In respect of the former, the parties had agreed on the pool of matrimonial assets, save that the Plaintiff contended that: (i) the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, and that a certain sum should consequently be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets to account for this; and (ii) that the Defendant had transferred a sum of $71,356.44 to his friend which should be added back into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I ultimately determined that: (i) a sum of $101,874.69 should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets on account of the shares that were dissipated by the Defendant; and (ii) the sum of $71,356.44 transferred by the Defendant to his friend should also be added back into the pool. I valued the total pool of matrimonial assets at $1,096,817.10 and determined that this should be divided in the proportion of 75% to the Defendant and 25% to the Plaintiff. I further ordered that there should be no spousal maintenance for the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Plaintiff has since appealed specifically against my computation of the amount to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets owing to the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X. My decision here will therefore focus on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Company X was incorporated in 2009 by the Defendant and his friend, A. They each contributed $10,000 towards the start-up capital. The Defendant and A were the only directors and shareholders of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 19 May 2015, the Defendant transferred all 250,000 of his shares in Company X to his elder child, C1. C1 was 23 years old and a university student at the time. This transfer was approved by himself and A as directors of Company X<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. On the same day, the Defendant tendered his letter of resignation to relinquish his position as a director of Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For reasons that are disputed, though his shares were transferred to C1 on 19 May 2015, the Defendant continued as a director of Company X until 21 August 2018, when C1 was made a director of the company in his place. C1 was 26 years old at that point, and remained a university student.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Although the Defendant had ceased to be the legal owner of the shares as at the date of the interim judgment, the Plaintiff nevertheless posited that the value of those shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff’s case was that the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X to C1 was an act of wrongful dissipation intended to deplete the pool of matrimonial assets at a time where the divorce was imminent. The Plaintiff argued that the shares were sold to C1 at an undervalue, that the Defendant’s narrative surrounding the disposal of his shares was untrue, and that the Defendant’s explanation for the transfer was unbelievable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Defendant’s position was that the sale of his shares to C1 was a legitimate one done at a fair and accurate market value. The Defendant disagreed that divorce proceedings were imminent at the time of sale. The Defendant consequently objected to the value of the shares being added to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined and the applicable law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Generally, the starting point in an exercise to divide the matrimonial assets is the identification of matrimonial assets and their respective values. The default operative date to determine the assets in the matrimonial pool is the date of the interim judgment, though the court retains the discretion to depart from this default position (see <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [31]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, simply identifying all the assets and liabilities in existence as at the operative date may not always sufficiently reflect the true material gains of the marriage, and therefore may not result in a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. This may be the case where an asset was expended <em>prior</em> to the operative date, such that the value of the asset would not be reflected in the pool of assets, to the benefit of the party who disposed of the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To achieve an equitable outcome, the court is therefore empowered to add certain sums back into the pool of matrimonial assets. <em>Where divorce proceedings are imminent</em>, the court may order a substantial sum expended by one party to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets if the other spouse was considered to have at least a putative interest in it and had not agreed to the expenditure, whether or not the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets or not (see <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, even <em>before divorce is imminent</em> (or the grant of interim judgment), where it is proven on the facts and evidence that an expenditure amounts to wrongful dissipation with the intention of depleting the matrimonial pool, the court may add a sum back into the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [66] to [68]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     With the relevant authorities in mind, I considered the following two questions to determine whether the value of the shares in the company should be added to the pool:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Were divorce proceedings imminent at or around May 2015; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Did the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amount to wrongful dissipation?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     If I were to determine that the value of the shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, then I would have to decide what notional amount I should add to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 1: Whether divorce proceedings were imminent at or around May 2015</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I first considered if divorce proceedings were imminent at or around the time that the Defendant transferred the shares to C1, <em>i.e.</em> on 19 May 2015. If divorce was imminent, I could, per the dicta in <em>TNL</em>, add the value of the shares back to the pool of matrimonial assets, whether or not the Defendant had deliberately attempted to dissipate the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Plaintiff argued that the parties’ marital relationship was no longer functioning at this time, and that divorce between the parties was imminent. The circumstances drawn up by the Plaintiff were as such: in April 2015, the Defendant committed family violence against her. This led to the Plaintiff applying for a personal protection order in or around May 2015, which she subsequently withdrew upon the Defendant providing an undertaking at a mention on 23 June 2015 that he would not use family violence against her. Around this time, the Defendant threatened her with divorce and reduced her allowance. Viewed as a whole, the Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant’s conduct indicated that the ‘prospect of divorce’ was already on his mind at the time. The Plaintiff suggested that the Defendant only withheld filing for a divorce at that time to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1), which formed the basis for the grant of the IJ, did not rely exclusively on events in or around May 2015; nor did it cite the events in or around May 2015 as the core reason for the divorce. Rather, it referred to events even after May 2015 and suggested that the parties’ relationship had deteriorated over the years after the altercation in 2015, and that it was a cumulation of events that resulted in the breakdown of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The fact of the matter is that the Writ for Divorce was only filed some eight years later. The Plaintiff withdrew the PPO, ostensibly with the hope of reconciliation. After May 2015, the parties even went on various overseas holidays as a couple between 2017 and 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff could have filed for a divorce herself at any time earlier, but did not do so. She consciously chose to stay in the marriage, even if for material reasons only. In the Plaintiff’s affidavits, she expressed her disappointment at the Defendant’s efforts to the marriage, which suggested that she continued to hold expectations of him as her husband over the years, even after 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It therefore appeared to me that the love might have been lost, but the marriage very much remained. I was not satisfied on the evidence that divorce was imminent at that point in time, and did not accept the Plaintiff’s hypothesis that the Defendant only resisted filing for a divorce all those years just to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 2: Whether the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amounted to wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Notwithstanding my finding that the divorce was not imminent in May 2015, I examined if the Defendant’s shares in Company X were wrongfully dissipated. If so, the court may nevertheless add the value of these shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets, even if divorce was not imminent at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Were the Defendant’s shares transacted at an undervalue?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I first considered the value of the consideration that the Defendant said he received for the shares. While the adequacy of the consideration received might not in itself be determinative of the legitimacy of the transfer, the disposal of shares for consideration less than its true value might indicate that the transfer should not simply be taken at face value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this regard, the Defendant’s position was that the consideration of $150,000 was intentionally calculated to “<em>accurately reflect the market value of the shares</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant explained his calculation as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The principal amount of $359,820.98, based on the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of the 250,000 shares in Company X as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet C for Transfer of Shares (“IRAS Working Sheet”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Divided by two, <em>i.e.</em> $179,910.49, because half of the shares were held on C1’s behalf, and that C1 therefore only needed to pay him for the Defendant’s half of the shares; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Less the sum of $29,500, being the Defendant’s estimation of the company’s losses in 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Shy of any better evidence, I accepted the NAV as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet. This document purported to contain information from the company’s management accounts as at 31 January 2015, which preceded the events in April 2015 cited by the Plaintiff. There was nothing put forth by the Plaintiff to suggest that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable, nor did the valuers engaged by the Plaintiff (the “Plaintiff’s Valuers”) suggest that there was something untoward about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I found the rest of the Defendant’s formula to be problematic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Firstly, there was a slight inaccuracy in the Defendant’s calculation, as applying his formula should result in the amount of $150,410.49, not $150,000. No explanation was given for using the lesser sum, not even an explanation that he chose to round it down for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Secondly, by the Defendant’s own admission, there were no documents or correspondences exchanged between Company X, C1 and himself evidencing how the consideration of $150,000 was actually determined at the time of the transfer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Thirdly, and importantly, I did not accept the Defendant’s reasons for dividing the NAV of his 250,000 shares in two. The Defendant claimed that C1, who was only around 17 years old at the time, was the beneficial owner of half the shares because he used $5,000 of C1’s <em>ang bao</em> monies (that the Defendant had saved up over the years on C1’s behalf) toward the start-up capital of Company X. I found this be a weak and baseless claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no documentary evidence showing that the Defendant had taken a sum of $5,000 that belonged to C1, or that C1 was the beneficial owner of half of the shares, whether such evidence took the form of a trust deed, or even contemporaneous emails or messages. The Defendant simply relied on a bare assertion that at the material time, he had a verbal agreement with C1 that he would hold C1’s shares in his name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I noted that this assertion was not even something that C1 himself corroborated on affidavit, despite C1 having filed two affidavits in these proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It seemed inconceivable that the Defendant did not have the sum of $5,000 at his disposal at the time, such that he had to rely on C1’s savings. There was also no explanation as to why the Defendant could not have taken this sum of $5,000 as a loan from C1 instead. Similarly, there was no explanation as to why he did not include C1 as a shareholder of the company any earlier, if he was indeed the beneficial owner of half of the Defendant’s shares;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, on the face of the documents titled “Return of Allotment of Shares” dated 1 November 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and 14 August 2013<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011 and 10,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 7 August 2013. The documents indicated that there were further cash payments made to acquire those shares. However, there was no evidence that C1 had put up any further cash payments toward those shares, such that any shares from further allotments should be attributed to him too. While the Defendant suggested that C1 had a 25% interest in the company’s profit and returns, and that a portion of such profits was reinvested over the years, I noted that there was no evidence of C1 receiving any corresponding share of dividends or profits over the years. There was also no evidence proving this arrangement or showing C1’s agreement to this arrangement. The affidavits filed by C1 also did not attest to such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Lastly, there was no objective evidence showing what the company’s losses were in 2015 to support how the Defendant arrived at the figure of $29,500. That was simply an estimate that he had decided on his own, with no apparent basis whatsoever.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was also no explanation as to why the sum of $29,500 was only deducted from half of the NAV of the 250,000 shares and was not first deducted from the full NAV before dividing the remainder by two, which would have resulted in a different balance of $165,160.49 instead. This appeared to me to be a contrived attempt at backward reasoning to justify the figure of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I therefore found that the consideration of $150,000 was not commensurate with the value of the shares. This was also the finding arrived at by the Plaintiff’s Valuers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The fact that the Defendant accepted this amount, which was much lower than its NAV, and which was derived at without any coherent method of calculation, suggested that the transaction might not have been done at arm’s length. I noted that the Defendant never explained that he had accepted a consideration of lower value on account of his relationship with C1, though this might have been understandable, and perhaps even reasonable. Rather, the Defendant was constant in his insistence that the transfer had been done at fair market value. I therefore held the Defendant to this standard in examining the veracity of his claim, and found that he fell short.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Defendant’s explanation for transferring the shares in May 2015 credible?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     To explain his decision to transfer his shares to C1, the Defendant reasoned that around the time of the transfer, the parties’ relationship was strained and that for a prolonged period of time, he “<em>lost sleep due to the Plaintiff’s behaviour at home</em>”. The Defendant felt that with his increasing workload and his struggle with the English language, he was unable to perform his role as a director properly. The Defendant felt stressed and under pressure and therefore decided to resign and transfer his shares on 19 May 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     These did not strike me as very compelling reasons for disposing of his shares at the time that he did. Company X had been operating since 2009 and had been profitable over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It did not seem to me that the Defendant’s deficiencies with the English language, if any, had been a hindrance to him conducting his business effectively, and it seemed odd that he would see this as a challenge after six years of operating the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Furthermore, these operational burdens would have arisen from his role as a director, not a shareholder. The Defendant could have simply resigned from his role as director, without having to give up his shares. Rather, the opposite happened, as he sold his shares but had to remain as director for another three years or so. This would have done little to relieve him of the burdens he supposedly felt about the job. It also did not make sense to me that he found his ownership of his shares so stressful, yet so readily passed this apparent ‘poison chalice’ on to his son, without harbouring any similar concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Apart from an allusion to the business being a private company, there was no actual explanation as to why the Defendant decided to sell his shares to C1, and not anyone else. There was no evidence that this sale was something he had been considering for some time, nor was there any evidence of any attempt to sell these shares at a higher value to A or to another third party. I noted that the Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff of the transfer of the shares in Company X, and that the Plaintiff only found out on her own much later. If this was a legitimate arrangement with nothing untoward about it, there was no reason for him to have kept the Plaintiff in the dark this whole time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In light of the above, I did not find the Defendant’s reasons to be credible, particularly in the context of the state of the parties’ relationship at the time. The Defendant’s explanation did not resolve my suspicions, but conversely raised further doubts about the transaction, and gave a sense that the Defendant was obfuscating the truth. I therefore found that that the transfer of shares was, on the balance of probabilities, done with the intention of keeping them beyond the Plaintiff’s reach and depleting the pool of matrimonial assets, particularly given the lack of trust between the parties at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 3: The amount that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets to account for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having decided that the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, it remained for me to determine the notional value to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets. In this regard, I considered the operative date for determining the value of the shares that were dissipated, and whether the full value of these shares as at said operative date should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">What is the operative date for determining the value of the dissipated shares?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Plaintiff’s position was that the value of 250,000 shares in Company X should added to the pool of matrimonial assets at their <em>present value</em>. To this end, the Plaintiff argued that the 250,000 shares should be valued at $1,930,000, being what the Plaintiff’s Valuers found to be their value as at 31 January 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I noted that 31 January 2023 was a date prior to the interim judgment but was nevertheless the latest available valuation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Without going into the correctness of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Valuation Report, I did not agree with the Plaintiff’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Plaintiff’s position was premised on the trite proposition that matrimonial assets are generally valued at the date of the ancillary matters hearing, or as close to the date as possible. However, the court retains the discretion from this where warranted on the facts and where there are cogent reasons to do so (see <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [42] and [43]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, it was not the shares that were being added back into the pool of matrimonial assets, but the <em>notional value</em> of those shares <em>to account for the Defendant’s dissipation</em>. An addition of any amount to the pool of matrimonial assets would have been by virtue of an exercise of discretion to correct the wrongful dissipation, and not by virtue of the Defendant’s ownership of the shares. Accordingly, I was of the view that it was the value of the shares <em>as at the time of dissipation</em> that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, not the latest value of the shares as though they had remained an asset in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As at the time of the hearing, C1 was the legal and beneficial owner of the shares. There was no evidence that C1 held these shares on trust for the Defendant. It would have been artificial and unduly prejudicial to the Defendant to adopt the latest value of the shares. It is anyone’s guess how Company X would have grown over the years had the Defendant remained a 50% shareholder of the company rather than C1, bearing in mind that shareholders are entitled to vote at meetings and thereby influence the company’s business decisions too. It is not the court’s place to dabble in such speculation, and it would be unfair on the Defendant to hold him to such speculative value where he has had no entitlement to any such gain in value from 2015 to 2023. If the reverse occurred and the value of the shares decreased significantly, or if the company had ceased its operation completely, it may be unfair on the Plaintiff if <em>nothing</em> was added back to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, where the shares were of considerable value at the time of dissipation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any case, I found that it would be onerous on the Defendant to add the full value proposed by the Plaintiff, which would have been close to double what I had found to be the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets. As there was no evidence that the Defendant had any interest in the shares since 19 May 2015, and similarly no evidence that he received any dividends from the company that had flowed from such interest since then, the Defendant would not have been able to tap on any commensurate gains in the shares over the years. This would have been prejudicial to his ability to satisfy any division order made. I did not think that this would have led to an equitable outcome in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It remains to be said that one of the key reasons that led to my finding of dissipation was that the transfer of shares to C1 was done at an undervalue. If the consideration paid was not $150,000, but closer to its NAV instead, I might not have found the transaction to amount to a dissipation but rather a mere liquidation of assets, and consequently might not have decided to add the value of the shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I therefore found on the justice of the case that adopting the value of the shares as at the time of dissipation, <em>i.e.</em> in May 2015, would be sufficient to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, whereas it would have been excessive to adopt the latest value of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the full value of the Defendant’s 250,000 shares be added to the pool?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a starting point to compute the value of the shares to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, I found it appropriate to adopt the NAV as declared in the IRAS Working Sheet, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     As mentioned above, there was no evidence that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable. On the face of the IRAS Working Sheet, the NAV of the shares transferred was calculated by deducting the value of the company’s total assets less the value of its total liabilities as declared as at 31 January 2015, divided by two (as the Defendant held 250,000 out of 500,000 shares). Given the dearth of information available as to the company’s finances at the time, the Plaintiff’s Valuers found the NAV method to be the only viable option to determine an estimate of the company’s minimum value.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I noted that the Plaintiff had previously issued a summons for discovery of, among other things, financial documents for the financial years ending 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016, but subsequently withdrew her application. Nevertheless, the financial statements for Company X for the financial years ending 31 January 2017 and 31 January 2018 were in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> These statements contained information relating to the company’s net assets for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Based on these statements, the total net assets for these years were respectively valued at $646,539, $531,480, and $523,568. Each of these values were lower than the NAV accepted for the financial year ending 31 January 2015. This suggested to me that the NAV of $719,641.96 (for all 500,000 shares) might not have been too far off, and was certainly not unrealistically low as a representation of the value of the shares as at May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The question that remained was whether I should simply add the full NAV of the dissipated shares, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98, back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this regard, I found that of the total of 250,000 shares, 75,000 were acquired before the marriage. This was evident from the Return of Allotment of Shares lodged on 1 November 2011, which showed that 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011, bringing his total shareholding at the time to 150,000 shares. There was no suggestion that any further shares were acquired between the date of the parties’ marriage (2 October 2011) and 26 October 2011. The likely inference was therefore that the Defendant had acquired 75,000 shares prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my assessment, these shares had not been converted into a matrimonial asset by way of either party having “<em>ordinarily used or enjoyed</em>” the shares, per Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), as I did not find that the Defendant working for the company and using any income received from this company toward family expenses to constitute ‘usage’ or ‘enjoyment’. There was also no suggestion that these shares were “<em>substantially improved</em>” on by the Defendant, per Section 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I also did not accept the ‘commingling’ argument run by the Defendant. Unlike monies in a bank account, I found that the shares were distinct and separately identifiable, and that there would be no issues tracing and separating the pre-marital shares from those acquired after the marriage. That there might have been some commingling of the <em>dividends</em> received by the Defendant only went so far as to suggest that the <em>dividends</em> might constitute matrimonial assets, but this was not the issue before me. I therefore found that the corresponding value of these 75,000 shares retained their character as pre-marital assets and should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The NAV of the remaining 175,000 was therefore $251,874.686. Of this amount, I found that the sum of $150,000, being the amount paid by C1 to the Defendant as consideration for the transfer of the shares in Company X, should be deducted from the notional value to be added back to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This sum of $150,000 was evidenced by an image of a cheque issued by Company Y,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> which was a sole proprietorship registered by C1 in 15 May 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff argued that it was incredible that C1 had the sum of $150,000 in his possession at the time. However, in my view, that it was equally unlikely that C1 would register a business if he had no such enterprise going on at the time, and that it was similarly unlikely for the Defendant and the C1 to have hatched a scheme register this business as a ruse just to execute this dissipation, given that Company Y was incorporated nearly a year prior to the transfer of shares on 19 May 2015. The Plaintiff did not further pursue her application for discovery against C1 and did not provide any concrete evidence to indicate that the monies were not C1’s, or that there were no monies paid out by C1 to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     While there were no documents showing the Defendant’s receipt of this sum, the Defendant had explained that he was unable to retrieve the relevant bank account statements, given the passage of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff did not pursue this matter in any application for discovery, and did not specifically question or dispute the receipt of this sum in her affidavit or in her submissions. In these premises, I found on the balance of probabilities that the Defendant had indeed received this sum of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Consequently, I found that the sum of $150,000 should be deducted from the NAV of 175,000 shares ($251,874.686). I therefore decided to notionally add back into the pool of matrimonial assets the balance sum of $101,874.69.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For the reasons set out above, I ultimately found that adding the sum of $101,874.69 back into the pool of matrimonial assets was the most appropriate and equitable redress for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation of his shares in Company X in May 2015.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 147 of the Defendant’s Voluntary Affidavit filed on 13 November 2023 (“DA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 82 to 83 of the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“DAM2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Page 152 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Pages 296 and 297 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit in support of FC/SUM 482/2024, filed on 21 February 2025 (“PA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 584 and 585 of PA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 14 of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“PVA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 50 of the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 9 June 2023;

They had four children together. It was a marriage that, up to the time the Wife filed for divorce on 12 January 2024, had lasted for almost 39 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on 20 June 2024. Thereafter, parties set a course for the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is in this context that the Husband had taken out this application for discovery <em>vide</em> SUM 3441/2024 (“SUM 3441”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the matter on 20 January 2025. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These were the two items which the Husband had asked for in respect of discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     All Whatsapp messages between the Wife and [A], including those in the deleted folder, for the period January 2020 to October 2024 (“Item 1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     All Whatsapp messages between the Wife and [B], including those in the deleted folder, for the period January 2020 to October 2024 (“Item 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the hearing, the Husband offered two reasons as to why the Wife should be ordered to disclose these Whatsapp messages. First, to prove that she had committed adultery with these two men, [A] and [B], and second, to prove that because of the “wayward” lifestyle she had lived, she could not have made significant financial contributions to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, made two broad points as to why disclosure of these Whatsapp messages should not be ordered. First, that there was no <em>prima facie</em> evidence that these messages had, at any time, been in the Wife’s possession custody or power.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Second, and in any event, the Husband had not shown that the Whatsapp messages were relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – the discovery process should not be used to “excavate imaginary bones in the closet” and even if there was any evidence of adultery, it was clearly not relevant to the disputed issues insofar as the ancillary matters were concerned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is well established that when it comes to applications for discovery, the court is guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity – in other words, the party seeking discovery must show that these documents are both relevant and necessary to the issues in dispute: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22] and [24] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, the court in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> had (at [64]) also noted that a pre-requisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought do indeed exist:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    A prerequisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some evidence that the document requested is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power. The standard of proof is that of a <em>prima facie</em> case: see <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]). In the present case, I find that there is prima facie evidence of the existence of the bank account by way of inference drawn from the evidence given by the Wife as explained above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the present case, the Husband had merely asserted, during the hearing, that his younger daughter had allegedly chanced upon these messages. This was not something that I could take notice of given that it was not stated on affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I also note that while the Husband had, in his 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Asset and Means, gone into some detail about the Wife’s two alleged affairs, he had not exhibited any documentary evidence to corroborate his allegations. There was nothing that had been exhibited in the affidavits before me to indicate, on a <em>prima facie</em> basis, the existence of such messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Even assuming that there was such <em>prima facie</em> evidence, the Whatsapp messages were neither relevant, nor necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. I do not accept the Husband’s argument that the Whatsapp messages were relevant in that they would show that the Wife could not have made financial contributions to the family because of her “wayward lifestyle” as evinced by her alleged acts of adultery. Even if these messages existed, they would only cast light on the nature of the relationship between the Wife, and [A] and [B] – it would hardly go towards showing the extent of the direct, or indirect, financial contributions which the Wife had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband’s application in SUM 3441 is thus dismissed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters. The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Unless parties are able to agree on the issue of costs, they are to tender their written submissions on costs by way of letter to court. This shall be done no later than 10 February 2025, and these submissions shall not exceed 3 pages.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 5 citing <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 12.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2025-01-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4355 of 2023 (Summons No 3472 of 2024)","title":"XHW v XHX","citation":"[2025] SGFC 12","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32827-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chan Xian Yi, Jonathan (Zeng Xianyi) (Chia Wong Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHW v XHX</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHW <em>v</em> XHX </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32827-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 12</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4355 of 2023 (Summons No 3472 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chan Xian Yi, Jonathan (Zeng Xianyi) (Chia Wong Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHW — XHX </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married in the United Kingdom sometime in July 2009. They lived in various countries until 2019, when they decided to settle down in Singapore. It was also in 2019 that parties welcomed the one and only child to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In this case, it was the Wife who had filed for divorce on 8 September 2023, citing the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour as the reason behind the irretrievable breakdown of their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars (Amendment No 1) sets out details of how their marriage had broken down, as well as details of their habitual residence in Singapore, which forms the basis for this court’s jurisdiction over their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Interim judgment was obtained on 25 January 2024. Thereafter, parties plotted a course for the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is in this context that the Wife has taken out an application for discovery and interrogatories <em>vide</em> SUM 3472/2024 (“SUM 3472”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I heard the application on the bulk list and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is well established that the court will only order interrogatories if those interrogatories are both relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> [2024] SGFC at [22]. It is also well established that the court, at the interlocutory stage, is not concerned with the truth of any answers given to an interrogatory, but rather, whether that answer is sufficient: <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a> at [9] – [11]; <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [28] – [30].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife, Mr Jonathan Chan (“Mr Chan”) confirmed that, where the interrogatories were concerned, the Wife was only proceeding in respect of four out of the five items which she had originally sought in SUM 3472. I shall deal with them in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I first deal with the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to state and explain the whereabouts and purpose of several recurring withdrawals/payments from his HSBC account ending -21. These transactions ranged in value from £500 – £990.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3 was a request for the Husband to state and explain the current whereabouts and purpose(s) of the several recurring monthly withdrawals from his HSBC premier account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Mathea Lim (“Ms Lim”), argued that the Husband should not have to answer these interrogatories on the basis that the transactions involved are insubstantial. In support of this argument, they cite my earlier decisions in <em>XDD v XEE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32212-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 79</a> and <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> for the proposition that the process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as an exercise in forensic accounting. Ms Lim had also highlighted in written submissions that the Husband had explained that these transactions made in the UK were for the payment of bills, and that they have been made on a regular basis since the family had relocated to Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I do not find that the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3 was an attempt to engage in a forensic accounting exercise. I agree with the point Mr Chan had made – that these expenses, which were not insignificant, were rather odd given that the parties had relocated from the UK to Singapore. In this vein, it is clear to me that this interrogatory is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – it would show why the Husband had continued to incur and pay for expenses in the UK although parties were no longer living there, and how he had managed to do so especially given that he had stated that he had been unemployed for the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This would have a bearing on issues such as whether there had been dissipation of matrimonial assets, the Husband’s financial capacity to pay for child maintenance, and whether there were any other undisclosed bank accounts or credit cards in the Husband’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For the reasons set out above, the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Item 2 was a request for the Husband to “state and explain the sum(s) of monies” which he had allegedly loaned to his helper, and to provide details of when such loans had been disbursed and what was the outstanding sum loaned to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The basis for the Husband’s objection is that a voluntary request had not first been served. Mr Chan does not dispute that no voluntary request had been served. He explained that the Wife had taken such a course of action in a bid to avoid protracting proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the fact that a voluntary request for Item 2 had not first been served, I am still minded to deal with the Wife’s request on its merits, though I would add that the failure to comply with the applicable rules of procedure may be a relevant consideration when it comes to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I find that Item 2 is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The quantum of the loan which the Husband had extended to their helper certainly goes towards the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As a final point, I note that the Wife did, in fact, ask the Husband in her voluntary request for discovery, to disclose documents showing payments made to their helper. The Husband had provided a rather detailed explanation as to why such payments were made and why such payments were no longer reflected on the relevant bank statements. The Husband’s explanation, however, does not state the sums which he had loaned to the helper, and the outstanding sums that are still owed to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> These are all pertinent points that would have a bearing on the issues at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I come now to the final request in Item 4. This was the request as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to state and confirm whether the flat in Seoul, South Korea at [XXX] is the only South Korean property he and his parents own and have ever owned, and if not, the address and particulars of ownership of any other property owned by the Defendant or his parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Although it is undisputed that a voluntary request in respect of this item had not been served, as I had stated above (at [14]), I am not minded to dismiss the Wife’s request on that basis. In my judgment, this interrogatory is certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – any properties in the Husband’s name, or that are being held on the Husband’s behalf are certainly a relevant consideration when it comes to determining the matrimonial pool of assets as well as the division of such assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife’s request in Item 4 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I come now to the items which the Wife had sought in discovery. In considering the Wife’s application, I bear in mind the principles that govern the discovery process, namely, that the court will only order discovery if the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     During the hearing, Mr Chan confirmed that the Wife was not pursuing her request in respect of Items 4, 9, and 11. I shall deal with the rest of the items in turn. I will also make brief mention of Item 9 given the points that were raised by both Mr Chan and Ms Lim at the hearing before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to produce documents showing the disbursements, transactions and purpose of loans taken from January 2023 to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband does not dispute the relevance or the necessity of these documents. Rather, his position is that he has no such documents in his possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As I had noted in <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75], parties cannot “tiptoe around” their obligation to give discovery with the mere assertion that they do not have the documents which are requested for. The Husband cannot sidestep his obligation to provide disclosure with the bare assertion that he has no such documents in his possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 1. If the Husband says that he does not have these documents, he must provide an explanation on affidavit, and exhibit any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Item 2 was a request for documents showing the current whereabouts and purpose of various recurring withdrawals from the Husband’s HSBC account ending -21. This mirrored Item 1 of the Wife’s request for interrogatories (see above at [8(a)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 2 for the same reasons which I had set out above (at [10]). Although Ms Lim urged me to disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item on the account that the sums in question were insubstantial, and that the process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as a tool to aid in a forensic accounting exercise, as I have explained, the documents sought would cast light on why the Husband had continued to incur these expenses in the UK although parties were no longer living there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Item 3 was a request for documents showing that the Husband had temporarily borrowed a sum of $2000 from one [K] on 26 June 2023, the whereabouts of this sum, and the purpose of the alleged loan.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Husband’s basis for objecting to this request was that he had already provided all the documents in his possession, custody and power. He states that there was no written documentation in relation to these loans which were extended to him by friends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Wife, on the other hand, argues that disclosure should be ordered because the Husband has repeatedly made claims that various deposits and withdrawals from his bank accounts are loans/repayment of loans, but did not provide any supporting documents to back up his assertions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> During the hearing, Mr Chan emphasised the point in his oral submissions that if these were indeed loans made from the Husband’s friends, there would be some messages to evidence such an arrangement. In this connection, these messages would go towards establishing the liabilities which the Husband now claims to have.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I note that the Husband’s explanation, that this transaction was repayment of a loan given to him by [K], was his response to the Wife’s voluntary request for discovery. It is a bare explanation. The Husband simply stated that it was a temporary loan from [K] made on 26 June 2023. He did not state any reasons as to why he could not produce the requested documents, neither did he state that he did not have any documents in his possession, custody or power given the nature of the loan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the circumstances, I will allow the request in respect of Item 3. The documents are, in my judgment, certainly relevant and necessary. It would go towards assessing whether this transaction was indeed for the repayment of the loan as the Husband alleges.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I come now to Items 5 and 6. I shall deal with them together as they both concern various deposits which had been made to the Husband’s UOB account ending -8. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 5 was a request for documents to show that various deposits into the Husband’s UOB account ending -8 was for alleged “loans” extended to him for his living expenses and legal fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 6 was a request for documents showing the source as well as the purpose of various deposits made by certain individuals into the Husband’s UOB account ending -8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband objects to both Items 5 and 6 on the same basis as Item 3 – that he had already disclosed all the documents in his possession, custody and power, and that because these were loans which had been extended to him by family and friends, there was no documentation of any such loan agreements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife’s argument in respect of Items 5 and 6 was that that these were rather substantial deposits to the Husband’s UOB account. Accordingly, these documents would establish whether they were indeed loans extended to the Husband, or proceeds from any other sources of income or funds that the Husband had yet to disclose. This would have a bearing on issues such as determining the matrimonial pool of assets, the division of matrimonial assets and the Husband’s ability to pay maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Again, I note that in the Husband’s response to the Wife’s voluntary request for the same documents as set out in Items 5 and 6,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> he explained that these were “monies loaned” to allow him to pay for his living expenses and legal fees in Singapore and that there were “no documents for the said loans” “save for those already previously provided”. The Husband merely asserts that there are no documents, but does not go on to explain why that is the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In my judgment, both Items 5 and 6 are certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would allow the court to assess the source of these deposits into the Husband’s account and the reasons for these deposits. This would, as Mr Chan had rightly pointed out in written submissions (see above at [36]), have a bearing on issues such as ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets and maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife’s request in both Items 5 and 6 are allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn now to Item 7. This was a request for the Husband to produce documents showing the source of funds and the purpose for various deposits from company [T] to the Husband’s UOB account ending -8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Again, the Husband objects to this request on the basis that he had already provided all the documents in his possession, custody and power.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> He says that these were loans extended to him by his family which had been transferred to him via a wire transfer service provider which was reflected as company [T] on his bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife, on the other hand, argues that these documents are relevant to showing the source of such funds which are relevant to issues such as ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets, whether there had been dissipation of any matrimonial assets and maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I agree with the arguments advanced by the Wife – these documents would show the source of the funds, and would, accordingly, shed light on the Husband’s true financial capacity and whether these were indeed, as he says, loans extended to him by his family. This would go towards issues such as ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets as well as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Wife’s request in Item 7 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Item 8 was a request for documents showing the current whereabouts and purpose of several recurring transactions from the Husband’s HSBC premier account ending -1. This request mirrored the Wife’s request for interrogatories at Item 3 (see above at [8(b)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Given that I had allowed the Wife’s request for interrogatories, I will also allow this request for discovery. The Husband shall answer the Wife’s interrogatory as framed in Item 3 and provide the relevant documents requested. In my judgment, these documents sought are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – they would cast light on why the Husband had, by his account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> continued to pay for bills incurred in the UK although the family had since relocated to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Item 9 was a request for documents showing the source of funds and purpose of some 21 deposits into the Husband’s HSBC premier account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     During the hearing, Mr Chan explained that the Wife was no longer pursuing Item 9 given the Husband’s response in his reply affidavit to SUM 3472. That being said, the Husband had also disclosed the existence of <b><em>two</em></b> other credit cards which he had not previously disclosed. Given this, the Wife now wanted the statements of these credit cards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Ms Lim, naturally, objected to this. She said that the Wife was now shifting the goalposts of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I did not think that this was necessarily the case. As I had explained to Ms Lim during the hearing, my understanding was that the Wife was merely seeking further discovery of the statements of these two credit cards which had now surfaced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In any event, even if Mr Chan was asking that I order the disclosure of these two credit card statements, I was not minded to consider the request given that it was not included in SUM 3472, and the Husband did not appear to have had the opportunity to consider the request. In the circumstances, I directed that any further voluntary request for interrogatories and discovery be filed and served by 27 January 2025. The Husband was to give his response by 17 February 2025. I also further directed parties to attend at a Case Conference after 17 February 2025 to update the court on the status of the voluntary request and whether a formal application would be required.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I come now to the final request in Item 10. This was a request for documents showing that the Husband had received retrenchment benefits as well as 3 months’ worth of salary in lieu of notice. These sums of money had allegedly been paid to the Husband’s HSBC Singapore account in May 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Husband argues that the Wife’s request should be disallowed. He says that he had already obtained the relevant bank statement, and sought the Wife’s consent to file a further affidavit to SUM 3472 to exhibit this statement. However, the Wife did not reply. As such, this bank statement was annexed to his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     During the course of the hearing, Mr Chan argued that the sums which the Husband alleges had been paid to him as part of his retrenchment package does not match that in the bank statement which the Husband had belatedly disclosed. The Wife was therefore maintaining her request in Item 10, and sought a court order for the Husband to produce these documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It appears that the Wife is continuing the maintain her request in Item 10 because of the discrepancy between the bank statement the Husband had produced, and what he had previously declared. However, the discovery and interrogatory process is not an avenue for parties to ventilate arguments on where the truth may lie in relation to matters which are in dispute. Given that the Husband has produced a bank statement that appears to reflect the deposit of his retrenchment benefits, I make no order in relation to Item 10. I will, however, order the Husband to exhibit this bank statement in his compliance affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In summary, I make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatories as set out in Items 1 – 4 of the Request for Interrogatories (as indicated at para 2b of SUM 3472) on affidavit, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Request for Discovery (as indicated at para 1b of SUM 3472), whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband shall also exhibit, in his compliance affidavit, the bank statement contained in Annex A of his Written Submissions dated 10 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In addition, the Husband’s compliance affidavit is to be filed by 24 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Unless parties are able to agree on costs of SUM 3472, they are to write in, by way of letter, with their respective submissions on costs. This is to be done no later than 14 February 2025 and the length of these submissions shall not exceed 3 pages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the judge hearing the ancillary matters. The time limited for filing an appeal shall also begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Chan and Ms Lim for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at pp 29 – 30 and 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 855.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 854 where the Husband had explained that the transaction in question was a payment to [K] for “monies temporarily borrowed on 26 June 2023”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at p 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at p 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at pp 9 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 856.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at pp 12 – 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>See Husband’s Written Submissions at pp 22 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at Annex A.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – custody – access, care and control","Family Law – maintenance – child","Family Law – matrimonial assets – division"],"date":"2025-02-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4534 of 2023","title":"XHY v XHZ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 13","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32820-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan (Murthy & Co) for the plaintiff","Mr Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-02-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Nicole Loh","html":"<root><head><title>XHY v XHZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHY <em>v</em> XHZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32820-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 13</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The ancillary issues relating to custody, care and control, access of the children, division of matrimonial assets, wife maintenance and cost were adjourned to chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The ancillary matters proceeded for hearing on 7 January 2025 and my decision was delivered through Registrar’s Notice on 8 January 2025. The Wife has since appealed all of my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties are about 37 years of age and gainfully employed. The Wife was a senior Office Administrator and the Husband a freelance driver. At the time of the divorce, parties had been married for almost 9.5 years. There are 2 children born of their marriage, a son (turning 9 years in 2025) and a daughter (turning 7 years old in 2025). The Wife and children left the matrimonial home in March 2023. She applied for maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter and a by consent order for the Husband to pay $350 per month for each child’s maintenance was recorded without prejudice to her rights and claims for child maintenance in the divorce proceedings. There is also a Personal Protection Order against the Husband in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the hearing of the Ancillary Matters, I was informed by both counsel that parties are in agreement with the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Wife is not making a claim for her maintenance;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband shall pay the outstanding SP Services/utilities bills for the matrimonial flat incurred after March 2023; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Husband shall pay the outstanding Town Council Service and Conservancy charges for the matrimonial flat from March 2023 until the sale of the flat;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Husband shall pay 50% of the year end school books and uniform expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I accordingly ordered the above by consent as part of my eventual order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The issues before me for determination were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Care and control of the children and if shared care was not granted, access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Care and control and access </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife asked for care and control of the children to be granted to her and the Husband asked for shared care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife, in support of her claim, detailed her involvement in the care of the children since birth and in particular, how she became a homemaker for about 5 years before returning to employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband, in support of his case for shared care and control, points to the current arrangement since March 2023, wherein he has the children from Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm. He therefore submitted this should continue since it is workable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I do not find the current arrangements of timing that the Husband has with the children equates to a shared care and control order. It only provides for time the children spend with him. A shared care and control arrangement works in the interest of children if both parents are highly co-operative and willing to mutually discuss effective and reach agreements with regard to the daily activities of the children, e.g. which day the children go for what classes (without overly being calculative about how much care time that parent loses for example) so that the children’s daily life is seamless even when they switch homes. I do not believe the parties in this case have such a relationship. I find that the Wife has been the main caregiver of the children, therefore I grant her care and control in view of her involvement with the children since birth, their current young age and that they live primarily with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having granted care and control to the Wife, the issue of access to the Husband arises. The following access was agreed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Deepavali from 2pm to 8pm; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternate public holidays (except Deepavali) from 10am to 9pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As submitted by the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, he has had time with the children from Fridays 6pm to Sundays 6pm since March 2023. There were no allegations of violence from him towards the children. No issues have been raised by the Wife with regard to the time the children were with him since so he should have the same timing for access. He also sought half of the March, June, September and year end school holidays with liberty to travel and midweek dinner access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Although the Wife had raised issues with overnight access in her affidavits and concerns over the children’s safety in view of the Husband’s violent behaviour, there was no response from the Wife about the current arrangements described by the Husband that have been in place for more than 1.5 years. The Wife submitted that weekend time should be carved out for her as well and that March and September school holidays were a short one week so there was no need to grant half to the Husband. There was also a concern raised as to whether the Husband would exercise access faithfully in view of the uncertainty of the Husband’s hours of work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I accept that the Wife should also have some time on the weekends to spend with the children as she would have little opportunity to plan any leisure activities if she only has the weekdays when the children are in school and she is at work. I also accept that there is evidence to support her allegations of family violence by the Husband towards her but there is no evidence of any such behaviour towards the children. The fact that the Husband has been having overnight weekend access without incidents for more than 1.5 years also allay any concerns. As for his working hours, I accept the Husband’s submission that he can arrange for his work to be scheduled around access time given that it is flexible. There were no instances raised to show that he has not shown up for access. I am also wary of reducing access periods only on a speculative problem. Furthermore, plans can change even within an intact family. It is for parties to communicate and make alternative arrangements to deal with the change in plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Access time is to enable the children to continue to have a bond with a parent whom they do not live with primarily. I therefore granted half of the school holidays (including the March and September school holidays) and a midweek access bearing in mind the children’s routine given the following day would be a weekday. For completeness, even though the March and September school holidays are relatively shorter school holidays compared to the June and year-end school holidays, there is no reason not to give the Husband and children the opportunity for access. After all, public holidays (usually a brief one-day holiday) are also commonly shared between parents. I also allowed both parties the liberty to bring the children overseas during their time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made the following orders for access (including those by consent as set out in paragraph 11 above):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During school term,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Weekly from Friday 6pm to Saturday 8pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wednesdays from 5:40pm to 7:30pm;</p> <p

to take the children overseas during their time with the children upon at least 14 days advance notice to the other party with the travel itinerary and contact details.</p> <p

It was conceded the Husband provided the financial support for the family although the exact amount he provided was disputed. He claimed to have provided his entire salary which was between $2,000 to $7,000 previously. When the Wife started work, he stopped providing his entire salary but still provided $3,000 to $4,000. The Wife disputed the amounts he claimed to have provided but asserted that he gave her $2,000 monthly, which he at times took back from her when he ran out of money. There was no evidence to support either party’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Using a broad brush approach, I considered that generally the Wife was the main caregiver whilst the Husband was the breadwinner for about half their marriage.

items 8, 9 and 10 of the expense list. For item 8, both children are Singapore citizens enrolled in a local primary school. The school fees is listed as $13 per child and there is no explanation or evidence to prove the Wife’s claim that their school fee is $32.50 per child. I determined the school fees as $13/child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>, it was held that</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case……It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drafting up what can be described as a “budget”, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For enrichment/tuition, the Wife claimed a monthly expense per child of $340. This accounted for a substantive 1/3 of her expense claim for the children but there was no evidence on this expenditure or what it entailed. Not every child requires enrichment/tuition. Different types of enrichment and/or tuition will affect the reasonable amount to be budgeted for a child. Without any evidence as to any enrichment/tuition that the children are enrolled in and their costs, I excluded this claim. With regard to hobbies/sports claim of $135 per child, similarly there was a lack of evidence on this expense. However, I accept that it is reasonable for all children to have some form of hobbies and sports. Without any other evidence to assist me in in determining the reasonable sum based on the hobby or sports the child engages in, I allocated $60 per child per month for this expense on a broad budgeting basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife’s take home income is $2,913 and submits the Husband should have a higher income than what is declared because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Previously in the marriage when they were together, his income was $7,000 and this is proven by his self-declaration of providing $3,000 to the Wife monthly previously; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He continues to be in the same field of work so his income should remain the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband disputes earning $7,000 or $5,000, a figure was used by the Wife’s Counsel to submit he should pay more maintenance. He declared he earned an average of about $3,600 from his jobs. He exhibited his Notice of Assessment which shows he earned $48,000 in one year, i.e. $4,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I had difficulty accepting the Wife’s argument regarding the Husband’s past income because it is based on the Husband’s assertion which she has expressly disputed. If she wants the Court to disbelieve that he didn’t provide as much financial support as he claimed for the purposes of dividing matrimonial assets, she cannot then flip her entire position to now claim it is true for the purposes of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband has provided supporting evidence of his current income and there is no evidence to find that he has a higher income currently. Nonetheless, the Husband offered to bear 64% of the children’s expenses, which I find is a fair proposal given that he earns about 58% of their combined income. I therefore ordered him to pay 64% of $1,306 which amounts to $835.84. I rounded this up to $840 in total (i.e. $420 per child).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In view of both parties’ practical and reasonable approaches during the hearing before me and also in view that neither party really succeeded fully on any particular point, I made no order as to cost.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 of Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement"],"date":"2025-01-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 1648 of 2024","title":"XHQ v XHR","citation":"[2025] SGFC 10","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32809-SSP.xml","counsel":["The complainant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-02-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHQ v XHR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHQ <em>v</em> XHR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32809-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 10</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 1648 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The complainant in person and unrepresented; The respondent in person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHQ — XHR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Enforcement</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were divorced in 2016. Pursuant to an order of court (“FC/ORC xx/2016”), the Father was ordered to pay $500 as monthly maintenance for the two children of the marriage. This sum was to be deposited into the Mother’s bank account on the last day of every month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 19 July 2024, the Mother applied for an enforcement of maintenance arrears <em>vide</em> MSS 1648/2024 (“MSS 1648”). The matter was fixed for hearing, and I heard the trial on 1 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Towards the end of the trial, it was discovered that the Father had been recording the proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> A check done by the court officer showed two audio recordings of the trial on his phone. By recording the proceedings, the Father was in contempt of court: s 5 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. The Father was given an opportunity to purge his contempt: <em>You Xin v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0017.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 17</a> at [54]. He did so by deleting those recordings and confirmed that he had not disseminated any recordings made. He also apologised for his conduct. Assured that there would be no repeat of this behaviour, I decided it was appropriate to not take cognisance of the contempt and proceeded with the remainder of the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       After the trial, I reserved my judgment. On the 15<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, I handed down my decision where I allowed the Mother’s application and made the relevant orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       When it comes to the enforcement of maintenance orders, s 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 sets out what the court may do in the event that an order to pay maintenance has not been complied with. This, of course, assumes that the maintenance order should be enforced, and in that vein, it has been held that “the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is for a respondent to be given a chance to “show cause” (<em>ie</em>, provide reasons which are satisfactory to the Court) why an enforcement order should not be made against him or her”: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> (“<em>VUJ</em>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> at [20] citing <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a>; <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a> at [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As to when a respondent to an enforcement application has shown cause, that is an assessment which must, naturally, turn on the facts. At the end of the day, what is important to bear in mind is whether the making of an enforcement order would “lead to injustice and/or where it would be inequitable to do so given the circumstances and facts of a given case”: <em>VUJ</em> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To give a flavour of the sort of circumstances in which a respondent had been found by the Family Courts to have shown cause, I reproduce the succinct summary in <em>VUJ</em> at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg., <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg. <em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the trial, there was no dispute between the parties as to the arrears owed which came in at $3000 as of 1<sup>st</sup> November 2024. The real contention between the parties was whether the Father had given good reasons as to why these arrears should not be enforced against him, specifically, whether the Father’s medical condition was a good reason for his non-payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father gave evidence that he used to work as an IT engineer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> However, he had not been working this year owing to his medical condition. He testified that he had been admitted to hospital for treatment, and that he had a heart attack on 11 June 2024. Later, on 12 August 2024, he underwent cardiac surgery. The doctors had told him that a complete recovery would take approximately 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father also told me that he intended to look for work once he had fully recovered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In his estimation, he figured that he would be able to resume his obligation to pay child maintenance once he managed to find a job that was not too physically taxing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not doubt that the Father had a serious heart condition, or that he had had surgery. Signs that he had undergone surgery were plainly evident from the medical tubes protruding from beneath his shirt. In addition, the Father had also produced a bundle of medical certificates from the hospital which showed that he had been in and out of hospital since March 2024. There was also a letter from the doctor stating that the Father was receiving inpatient medical care, including cardiac surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father explained that notwithstanding his medical condition which had put him out of work since January 2024, he had tried his best to continue paying maintenance. He had drawn down on his savings to do so, and his current wife had also chipped in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He told me that his savings were down to $100, and that his current wife was shouldering the financial burden during this time. When quizzed about his current medical expenses, the Father said that he was paying roughly $200 each month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father, however, had not put any documents (<em>ie</em>, bank statements) in evidence to support his assertion that he was cash-strapped as a result of his medical condition and therefore could not afford the $500 monthly maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     That being said, I add that there are also two pieces of evidence which, to my mind, pointed to the <em>real</em> reason behind the Father’s failure to keep up with the maintenance payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The first was his response to the Mother’s question. She had asked why he could not simply have responded to her repeated text messages chasing him for payment to say that he could not pay.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s response was that the Mother was only concerned with getting the money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> When he was hospitalised, she did not enquire as to how he was doing, but rather, kept hounding him for the monthly payments. The Father went on to add that he was not spending time with the children despite having gone through supervised visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He told me that he wanted to spend time with the children, but the Mother did not allow that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second was a text message dated 12 June 2024. The Father’s current wife had texted the Mother, using his phone, to inform her that the Father was unwell and that the money would be transferred. The money owed, however, was never transferred and the Mother continued to hound the Father for payment. I would also note from the screenshots which the Father produced, that it is clear that the Mother did send rather nasty text messages to him in demanding for payment owed under the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It appears to me that the Father may well have ceased payment because of his frustration with the Mother’s attitude and her continued refusal to let him see the children. I would add that if it were indeed the case that the Father had intended to keep up with his maintenance obligations, but could not afford to do so, he could have sent the Mother a text, providing her with details about his health condition and asked for more time to make payment. Instead, there was radio silence. And while the Father chalks this up to his hospitalisation after surgery, he had more than 3 months to at least send a simple response to the Mother’s repeated text messages. He did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore did not find that the Father had shown cause as to why the arrears should not be enforced. Although the Father was still recovering from a heart operation, he had not managed to show that his medical condition put him in such dire financial straits such that he simply could not afford to pay the $500 monthly maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus allowed the Mother’s application in MSS 1648 to enforce the arrears of $3000 and made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father shall pay off these arrears in monthly instalments of $100, starting from April 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This sum of $100 shall be paid on the last day of every month;

Both applications had been taken out by the Wife who sought orders in relation to discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ submissions in respect of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Netto, argued in written submissions, that it was the Wife who should be, pursuant to Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (the “FJR 2014”), liable for costs to the tune of $500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was because the Wife had failed to, prior to taking out SUMs 3376 and 3318, serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories on the Husband. This meant that the Husband had no opportunity to respond to the voluntary request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Mr Netto further pointed out that while the Wife was self-represented, the learned Assistant Registrar had, in a case conference on 14 November 2024, highlighted that an “application for discovery and/or interrogatories ought to be in relation to existing request(s) where one party did not receive a satisfactory response to”, and that there could be cost consequences if one were to proceed with their application without first taking out a voluntary request.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Finally, Mr Netto argued that the Wife should be ordered to pay costs to signal, to parties, the importance and necessity of complying with the rules of procedure which are meant to ensure “fairness and equity in the proceedings”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife, on the other hand, took the position that she was entitled to costs in respect of both SUMs 3376 and 3318. She gave the following reasons. First, that apart from incurring $221.80 in the filing of both summonses, she had also spent a great deal of time and effort in learning how to navigate the “complex legal processes without the benefit of formal legal training”. Second, the Wife highlighted the Husband’s conduct, namely, that he would alternate between verbal threats and passive indifference which “created unnecessary delays and heightened emotional distress”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s behaviour took a toll on her which necessitated sessions with a psychologist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event. The court, however, can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Netto relies on Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the FJR 2014 to argue that it is the Wife who should have to pay costs to the Husband, even though she had succeeded in both her applications. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Costs arising from misconduct or neglect</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">857.—(1)    Where it appears to the Court in any proceedings that anything has been done, or that any omission has been made, unreasonably or improperly by or on behalf of any party, the Court may order —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the costs of that party in respect of the act or omission, as the case may be, shall not be allowed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that any costs occasioned by that party to any other party shall be paid by him to that other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), the Court must for the purpose of that paragraph have regard to the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the omission to do anything the doing of which would have been calculated to save costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the doing of anything calculated to occasion, or in a manner or at a time calculated to occasion unnecessary costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    any unnecessary delay in the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The Court may, instead of giving an order under paragraph (1), direct the Registrar to inquire into the act or omission and, if it appears to the Registrar that such an order should have been given in relation to it, to act as if the appropriate order had been given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The Registrar shall, in relation to anything done or omission made in the Court of taxation and in relation to any failure to procure taxation, have the same power to disallow or to award costs as the Court has under paragraph (1) to order that costs shall be disallowed to or paid by any party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Where a party entitled to costs fails to procure or fails to proceed with taxation, the Registrar may, in order to prevent any other parties being prejudiced by that failure —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    allow the party so entitled a nominal or other sum for costs; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    certify the failure and the costs of the other parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 857 is derived from Order 59 Rule 7 of the Rules of Court 2014 and forms one of the “well-established exceptions to the general rule that costs follow the event”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [857.01]. For example, it is noted that in cases where a plaintiff has adopted an “entirely wrong procedure”, that plaintiff may have to pay his opponent’s costs even though he has prevailed: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</em> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“White Book”) at 59/7/7 citing <em>Re Nichols &amp; Von Joel’s Contract</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/49176-E-M.xml')\">[1910] 1 Ch. 43</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, the Wife did not first serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, prior to taking out both applications. As I had noted in my judgment, the Wife could not, despite being self-represented, be said to be wholly ignorant of the applicable procedural rules: <em>XHA v XHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a> at [7]. I also note that in the case conference on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2024, the learned Assistant Registrar told the Wife that costs may be ordered if she did not first take out a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories before putting in a formal application to court – the Wife was also told to seek legal advice on the implications of pursuing her applications if she was unsure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s course of action naturally meant that there was no voluntary request for the Husband to respond to. As Mr Netto points out, this means that the Husband did not have the opportunity to “negotiate on the time period and/or type of documents to be provided”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I add that although the Husband had resisted the Wife’s application in both SUMs 3376 and 3318, this does not necessarily mean that he would have responded in the same way to a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The point remains that because a voluntary request for the items sought in SUMs 3376 and 3318 was never made, the Husband never had an opportunity to consider and respond to those requests, or make proposals in respect of these requests for the Wife to consider.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I deem it fit to depart from the general rule that costs shall follow the event. I order that the Wife pay costs for both SUMs 3376 and 3318, which are fixed at $350 (all-in), to the Husband. This is to be done by 24<sup>th</sup> February 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Child Maintenance"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 1060/2023","title":"XHM v XHN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 8","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32771-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Applicant-in-person and unrepresented","The Respondent-in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-01-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHM v XHN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHM <em>v</em> XHN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32771-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 8</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 1060/2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Applicant-in-person and unrepresented; The Respondent-in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHM — XHN </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child Maintenance</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       MSS 1060/2023 (“MSS 1060”) was the Mother’s application for maintenance for her 18-year-old son. The Mother sought, from the Father, $400 per month as maintenance for their son. Both the Father and the Mother had been divorced in October 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 4 September 2024 and allowed the Mother’s application. I ordered that the Father pay monthly maintenance of $150 per month, at the end of every month, with effect from 1 June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       When it comes to such applications for maintenance, s 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 is the first port of call. In particular, s 69(2) provides that the court may, “on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child” (see also <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [8(a)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found that the Father had indeed neglected to provide maintenance for his son. During the trial, I heard evidence from the Mother that she was the one who had supported the child, even throughout their marriage. The Father’s own testimony corroborated the Mother’s account. He told me that he had only contributed some money when his son was born. However, as his son was growing up, he could not afford to support him. This was because he was homeless and sleeping in the streets. The Father explained that he worked odd-jobs as a mover on a part-time basis and only made $70 a day. At times, he was only able to find a 2-day job in a single week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In my judgment, the Father should therefore be ordered to pay maintenance for his son – the next issue I had to consider was the quantum of such maintenance the Father should be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In making such an order for child maintenance, s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 stipulates that the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including factors such as the financial needs of the child (s 69(4)(<em>a</em>)), the income and earning capacity (if any) of the child (s 69(4)(<em>b</em>)), and the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage (s 69(4)(<em>d</em>)) (see also <em>WIM v WIL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28998-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 80</a> at [4] – [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>). The court does not adopt a mathematical approach to calibrating the quantum of child maintenance. As was recently noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Applicable legal principles for quantifying maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9     <b>Maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case: see s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”).</b> The mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance. Instead, parties should show how their projected expenditure for the child’s expenses is reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the child’s standard of living and the parents’ financial means and resources. Further, the changed circumstances following the marital breakdown of the parents’ relationship are relevant as the breakdown of a household invariably has an impact on the family’s financial needs and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10     <b>It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure.</b> This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case. While receipts are useful as an indication of the child’s accustomed standard of living, they are not necessarily conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are. It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drawing up what can be described as a ‘budget’, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category (see, for example, the table set out below at [13]). It was observed in <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (at [13]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly, household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regular specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother explained that she had taken out her application in MSS 1060 as she was facing difficulty in supporting her son given the state of her health and her son’s growing expenses. She was unable to work as she was battling a host of medical conditions which included: a nerve issue which required surgery, as well as diabetes and cholesterol. In addition, the Mother also explained that she had been seeing a psychiatrist from the Institute for Mental Health for depression and anxiety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I also heard evidence that the son was working part time and was earning an hourly wage of $10. The Mother would give him some money amounting to $350 – $400 a month for school fees and food. I was also told, by the Mother, that the son, who is currently a student at the Institute of Technical Education, intends to further his education by enrolling in polytechnic. The Mother shared that the son would like to focus on his studies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Mother’s circumstances, it was clear to me that the Father must do his part to provide financially for the son. That is his responsibility as a parent. In that connection, the Father told me that in his estimation, he would be able to afford $100 a month in child maintenance, but only upon his release from prison in 2026. He had begun serving a two-year sentence earlier in March this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I thus ordered that the Father pay maintenance of $150 per month to his son starting from 1 June 2026, and that this sum be paid on the last day of every month. This means that the first payment will be made on the last day of June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In drawing up this order for maintenance, I placed weight on the Father’s financial circumstances and his capacity to make payment (see <em>VLO v VLP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26219-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 68</a> at [135]; <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [14] – [15]). I accepted that the Father currently had no means of paying monthly child maintenance given his testimony that he had no savings, and the fact that he was currently in jail. It was also likely, in my judgment, that the monthly sum of $400 which the Mother had sought, while a reasonable sum to ask for in respect of child maintenance, would be beyond the Father’s means. There was, in my judgment, little point in making an order that the Father had no means of being able to comply with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to what the Father could reasonably afford, I took into account his evidence that he had previously been able to find part-time work at a rate of $70 per day. Even accepting that the Father may not be able to find part-time work at the same daily rate for every day of the month, the monthly sum of $100 which the Husband thinks he can afford is, in my judgment, on the conservative side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This order gives the Father a little time to get back on his feet upon his release from prison sometime at the end of March 2026. The Father will have about 3 months to find a job and to get his finances in order so that he can begin to do his part to support his son. While he has not done so for the better part of his son’s life, it is not too late for him to start doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given that the Mother did not ask for costs of her application, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Pursuant to an Order of the Syariah Court.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The appeal filed against the decision of the District Judge was deemed withdrawn on 22 December 2022.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2025-01-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 5149 of 2023 (Summons No 3306 of 2024)","title":"XHI v XHJ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 7","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32767-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ong Ying Ting, Eunice (Netto & Magin LLC) for the plaintiff","Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

They had two daughters. After more than two decades of marriage, the Husband filed for divorce on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October 2023, citing the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour as the reason for irretrievable breakdown of their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on the 25<sup>th</sup> of April 2024. Thereafter, parties charted a course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is in this context that the Wife has taken out an application for discovery <em>vide</em> SUM 3306/2024 (“SUM 3306”). During the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”) confirmed that the Wife was only proceeding on the following two items:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><u>Item 1:</u></b> Bank account statements for the following bank accounts for the period (January 2020 to May 2020 and January 2023 to December 2023):</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       OCBC account ending -57;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       POSB account ending -44;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       DBS account ending -46;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       DBS account ending -23.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><u>Item 2:</u></b> Bank account statements for a Standard Chartered Wealth Saver account ending -35 from the time the account was opened, till the time the account was closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is hornbook law that a party seeking discovery must demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to the hearing of the substantive matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       With regard to Item 1, the Wife explained that the bank statements are needed for two reasons. First, to ascertain why the Husband had received the sum of $45,000 from a third party, [X]. The Wife says that the Husband had told her, in a conversation, that he had lent this sum of money to [X]. The Husband’s account, however, is that [X] had transferred this sum to him to make investments on his behalf.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second reason the Wife gives is that these statements are needed to ascertain if the Husband had been dissipating assets. She points out that the Husband had, in April 2021, some $390,000 in his DBS account ending -6. However, in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) filed on 3 June 2024, the Husband discloses that he only has $8,903.73 in that account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, the documents which the Wife seeks disclosure of in Item 1 are certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would go towards the issue of whether the sum of $45,000 which [X] had sent to the Husband, was for an investment to be made on [X]’s behalf, or whether it was repayment for a loan which the Husband had made to [X]. It would also shed light on whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I note that the Husband has given his account of events relating to the sum of $45,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He has also explained the reason for the reduction in the balance in his DBS account ending -6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I must emphasise that, at the interlocutory stage, it is not for me to decide where the truth lies in relation to the various transactions which the Wife is disputing. The purpose of the discovery process is to ensure that all the relevant evidence is placed before the hearing judge, and also to allow parties the opportunity to evaluate their case: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14] citing <em>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0947.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 947</a> at [24] citing <em>Teo Wai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0573.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 573</a> at [41]. In that connection, a party only needs to demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As for the Husband’s objection to providing disclosure on the basis that it would be too costly for him to do so, I too, could not accept this argument. For one, the costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery. Although the court can depart from this starting point, and order that the party entitled to discovery “bear a whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such an order for the giving of discovery” (<em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [21] citing Family Justice Courts Practice Directions para 81(35) and (36); Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at p 945), I saw no reason to depart from this general position. After all, the Husband had, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, stated:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I also maintain that I have always provided a full and frank disclosure of my assets and finances as I have always kept good records of my finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Husband’s evidence, one would expect him to have kept copies of these bank statements. In any event, insofar as the Husband has stated that he would need to fork out, at the very least, $9,600 to obtain the statements which the Wife seeks,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> he did not put forward any documentary evidence from the banks to support his claim. As I had noted in my earlier judgment in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25    I would, however, observe that in a future case, it may well be open to the party giving discovery to seek liberty to apply for an order that the party entitled to discovery is to bear the entirety, or a portion of the costs that may be incurred in complying with the order for discovery. In doing so, that party must articulate their legal and factual basis for seeking such an order. Naturally, in deciding whether it is appropriate to make such an order, the court will consider all the relevant circumstances. This could include factors such as the quantum of such costs that had been incurred or were likely to be incurred, and whether there was any reasonable way to avoid incurring such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Finally, as to the Husband’s objection that the statements sought related to a period where divorce was not contemplated at all, the law is clear that it is indeed useful for the court to have an insight into parties’ finances during the breakdown of the marriage and prior to the filing of divorce. This is because, during the breakdown of the marriage, there is often a decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [9] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [79] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this connection, although the divorce was only filed in October 2023, I note from the Husband’s Statement of Particulars as well as parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> AOMs, that their marriage of some two decades, did not appear to have been an entirely happy one, and that their relationship had gone down the path of no return long before the divorce was filed. For instance, the Husband states, in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that their marital relations had begun to break down over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Wife also states, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had suffered “25 years of [p]hysical and [e]motional abuse” by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Apart from the various details which demonstrate that the parties’ relationship was strained years before the divorce, the Husband did also state, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, that the both of them always had “independence over [their] own bank accounts and finances” and that they would not “question each other on how” they chose to spend their own money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given this state of affairs, it appears that the Wife may not have had much knowledge, or involvement in the Husband’s finances. In that vein, the Wife’s request for the documents in Item 1 cannot be said to be a wholly unreasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the request in Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for the request in Item 2, the documents which the Wife seeks are, in my judgment, also relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. These bank statements would go towards verifying the Husband’s claim in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM that he used to hold the sum of $501,849 on behalf of his mother, and [X], for investment purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s main objection to giving disclosure in relation to Item 2 is that he no longer has the documents given that he has “disposed of all documents relating to this account”. I cannot accept this for two reasons. First, I find it rather strange that the Husband would dispose of these statements, especially given his claim that the money in this account belonged to other people. During the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Eunice Ong (“Ms Ong”) had told me that the Husband was careful with money and that he would keep the relevant statements where he had dealt with other people’s money. If this was indeed the case – then the Husband should have no difficulty in producing these bank statements. In any event, I note that the Husband has not provided proof that it would be impossible to obtain these statements by writing to the bank to request for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is also allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In summary, I therefore order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Schedule A of SUM 3306, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in his affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 10<sup>th </sup>of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As to the issue of costs, Ms Ong argued that parties should bear their own costs. Counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”), on the other hand, argued that the Wife should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given that the Wife had succeeded in her application, she is entitled to costs, which are fixed at $950 (all-in). In determining the quantum of costs, I took into account the fact that the Wife’s application was not a lengthy one and did not involve any novel points of law. The Husband is to pay this sum of $950 to the Wife by the 10th of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Ong and Ms Seetha for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 18(ff).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 20(xii).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 21.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2025-01-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)","title":"XHA v XHB","citation":"[2025] SGFC 6","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32763-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Luke Anton Netto (Netto & Magin LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHA v XHB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHA <em>v</em> XHB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Luke Anton Netto (Netto &amp; Magin LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHA — XHB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married on the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011. They welcomed a daughter to their family on the xx of November 2014. The Husband works as a Warrant Officer in the [xxx].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Wife, on the other hand, is currently unemployed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Details as to how their marriage broke down are set out in the Wife’s Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 2) (“SOP”). It is stated that the Wife felt that the Husband was “passive and unsupportive” of her emotional wellbeing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Although the Wife filed for divorce on 19<sup>th</sup> June 2023, it is clear, from her SOP, that their relationship had begun to deteriorate as early as 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the filing of the divorce, interim judgment was granted on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2024. Parties thus set course for the disposal of the ancillary matters. It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out her applications for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 3318/2024 (“SUM 3318”) and SUM 3376/2024 (“SUM 3376”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision in respect of SUM 3318 and 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The general principles relating to discovery and interrogatories are well established – that is, the court will only make the relevant orders if the requests for discovery or interrogatories are relevant and necessary: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition, it is also true that before an application for discovery or interrogatories may be taken out, a voluntary request to give discovery, or answer interrogatories, must first be made: Rule 63(4) and 69(5) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”). This forms the basis for the Husband’s objection to the Wife’s application in SUMs 3318 and 3376 – that because she did not put in a voluntary request for discovery or interrogatories, both her applications should be dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although the Wife was self-represented, it was apparent to me that she had done some research on the applicable procedures relating to the process of seeking discovery and interrogatories in family proceedings. It could not be said that the Wife was entirely ignorant of the relevant procedures – she had, after all, taken out a voluntary request for discovery in respect of other documents, and the Husband had provided his responses in respect of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       That being said, I am not inclined to dismiss the Wife’s application on the basis that she had failed to first make a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The matter had come before me, and it was perhaps more practical to deal with it on its substantive merits. After all, if I were to dismiss the Wife’s application for non-compliance with the FJR 2014, there was nothing barring her from making the same voluntary request – and then taking out another application in the event that she did not receive satisfactory responses from the Husband. The end result: a delay in bringing matters to a final conclusion, and more toing and froing between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What I have said above, however, must not be taken, or interpreted, as a basis for failing to comply with the applicable procedural rules. Even if the court is minded to look past any procedural defects and deal with the matter on its substantive merits, non-compliance with the applicable procedural rules is certainly a factor that may be accounted for when it comes to costs: see <em>eg</em>, Rules 854 and 857 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I turn now to deal first with the Wife’s application for interrogatories in SUM 3376. The interrogatories sought fell into two categories. The first were interrogatories relating to any bonuses the Husband may have received during the tenure of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Provide details of the gratuity bonuses received for each cycle of service in the [xxx], including the amounts received and the corresponding years (e.g., 6-year or 10-year cycles).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State when each gratuity bonus was paid and specify the account to which each payment was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Confirm whether the Defendant has signed on for life in the [xxx] and, if so, provide details of any annual bonuses received, including the amounts and dates of payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Provide details of the scheme signed, including the date of signing and any subsequent financial entitlements such as annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Luke Netto (“Mr Netto”), made the point that these interrogatories were a mere “fishing expedition” as the Wife had no proof that the Husband had received any gratuity bonuses which were not reflected in the bank statements which he had already disclosed, or that the Husband had indeed been hiding money from the Wife, or that he had been dissipating his assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterates that he only has one bank account into which his salary from the [xxx] is deposited.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I do not agree with Mr Netto’s characterisation of the Wife’s application as a “fishing expedition”. It might equally be said that it is precisely because the Wife has no proof that the Husband had not been hiding his assets – that is why she has to pose these interrogatories in order to obtain the information she needs to assess her case for the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my judgment, the interrogatories which the Wife sought (above at [10]) were certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It went towards the outstanding issues which included the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance. It would also go towards the issue of whether there had been any dissipation of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Items 1 – 3 of SUM 3376, but only for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The second category related to details of a safe deposit box which, according to the Wife, contained her personal jewellery that was now in the Husband’s possession:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Provide details regarding the safety deposit box opened jointly with the Plaintiff, including its closure status, the location of the items within, and any records of access to the box.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     During the hearing, Mr Netto argued that the Husband’s position was that the jewellery belonged to the Wife’s mother. In that vein, Mr Netto argued that if the Wife wished to assert a claim over the jewellery, which (allegedly) belonged to the Wife’s mother, then the proper thing was to follow the approach laid down in <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> (“<em>UDA</em>”) – in other words, the Wife should commence separate civil proceedings to obtain a declaration that the jewellery did belong to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The present case does not appear to fall neatly into the four situations described in <em>UDA</em> at [51]. The Wife’s ownership of the jewellery is disputed – but the Husband’s position is that the jewellery does not belong to him, but rather, the Wife’s mother. Having said that, insofar as it is alleged that the jewellery belongs to the Wife’s mother, I am not aware of any proceedings which the Wife’s mother may have brought to assert her alleged ownership over the jewellery (see <em>UDA</em> at [54]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     What is clear to me, however, is that the issue of whether these pieces of jewellery are indeed a matrimonial asset is one that will have to be decided at the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife had stated, in her first Affidavit of Asset and Means (“1<sup>st</sup> AOM”), that her position in relation to the jewellery was that these were gifts given to her on her wedding day and 21<sup>st</sup> birthday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Assuming that the jewellery were indeed gifts, one possible conclusion may be that they should be <em>excluded</em> from the matrimonial pool of assets: see s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To arrive at this conclusion, it must be established that: <b>a)</b> the jewellery does indeed belong to the Wife, and <b>b)</b> that the circumstances of their acquisition means that they should be excluded from the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Framed in this way, it is clear that the interrogatory posed by the Wife is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The interrogatory asks the Husband to provide details such as which pieces of jewellery were stored in the safe deposit box and their current location. The answers would go towards establishing whether the Wife owns the jewellery and whether they should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Item 4 of SUM 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 3318. The items which the Wife sought in respect of discovery mirrored that sought in her application for interrogatories. The first category of items concerned documents relating to the bonuses which the Husband had received during the course of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Documents showing the amount of gratuity bonuses received by the Defendant for each service cycle in the [xxx]. Include details for both the 6-year and 10-year cycles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    Bank statements of the account(s) where the gratuity and annual bonuses were deposited including POSB/DBS statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Documents confirming whether the Defendant signed on for life in the [xxx], including details of the specific scheme signed, the date of signing, and subsequent annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband objects to providing discovery on the basis that he only has a single bank account into which all his bonuses from the [xxx] have been deposited, and that it is hardly necessary for him to have to provide documents relating to the payment of all bonuses received since the start of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband also takes the position that the Wife’s request is nothing more than a fishing expedition given that she has not a shred of proof to show that he had been dissipating assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the same reasons I have set out above (at [12]), I do not think that the Wife’s request for discovery is a fishing expedition. As I had explained in an earlier judgment, one other function of the discovery process is to allow parties to “evaluate their cases and clarify issues in dispute”: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14]. The Husband’s responses to the Wife’s request for discovery would provide clarity as to whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I thus find that the Wife’s request for discovery as set out in Items 1 and 2 of SUM 3318 is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Husband is to comply with the request, but the period of disclosure shall be limited to the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024. This period would cover the years in which the Husband may have received gratuity bonuses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife’s request in Item 3, however, is disallowed. That request sought disclosure of documents confirming that the Husband had signed on “for life” including the details of his employment contract with the [xxx]. In my judgment, this request is hardly relevant or necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, especially given the orders which I have made above (at [25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The second category of items concerned documents relating to the safe deposit box containing jewellery which, according to the Wife, belonged to her:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Documents relating to the safety deposit box jointly opened by the Defendant and Plaintiff, including records of access, closure, and disposition of the items contained therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I had observed above (at [18] – [20]), it is clear to me that the issue of whether the jewellery is a matrimonial asset is likely to be raised at the hearing of the ancillary matters. These documents which the Wife is asking for in discovery would go towards shedding light on what had happened to the jewellery in the safe deposit box – this would have a bearing on any orders which the judge hearing the ancillary matters may make in relation to the jewellery which, according to the Wife, belongs to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife’s request in Item 4 of SUM 3318 is therefore allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     To sum up, it is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatories as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Items 1 – 3 of SUM 3376 (for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 till the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Item 4 of SUM 3376;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>on affidavit, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Items 1 – 2 of SUM 3318 (for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 till the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Item 4 of SUM 3318;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall exhibit, in his compliance affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In addition, parties are to write in, by way of letter to court, with their submissions on costs of both SUMs 3318 and 3376 by the 10<sup>th</sup> of January 2025. These submissions shall be limited to a maximum of 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Netto for his assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 23 April 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 28 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 2) at para 1e.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at paras 12 and 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit for SUMs 3318 and 3376 at pp 13 – 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 28 March 2024 at para 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at paras 15 – 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 3318 at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-12-23","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4687 of 2023 (Summons No 3413 of 2024)","title":"XGY v XGZ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 3","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32725-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim Hong Wen, Amelia, Low Seow Ling (Liu Xiaolin) (Emre Legal LLC) for the plaintiff","Michael Han Hean Juan (Han & Lu Law Chambers LLP) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-18T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XGY v XGZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGY <em>v</em> XGZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

At the time the divorce was filed on 23 September 2023, the Wife was pregnant with the parties’ first child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       As to why their marriage broke down, details may be found in the Statement of Particulars as well as the Wife’s Defence. Interim judgment was granted on the 14<sup>th</sup> of February 2024, and parties set course for the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out this application for discovery in SUM 3413/2024 (“SUM 3413”). She sought the following items in discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the period January 2023 to July 2023, and March 2024 to August 2024, the transaction history for various accounts with DBS, Citibank and American Express (“Item 1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In relation to certain credit cards which the Husband had with Standard Chartered Bank which were allegedly lost or cancelled, the transaction history for these cards from January 2023, up to the point the cards were lost or cancelled (“Item 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard arguments from parties on 16 December 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is trite law that when it comes to applications for discovery, orders will only be made if the court is satisfied as to the relevance and necessity of the documents sought: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22] – [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Michael Han (“Mr Han”) argued that these documents were indeed relevant and necessary because: <b>a)</b> they dealt with “quintessential matrimonial assets”, and <b>b)</b> they went towards shedding light on the Husband’s monthly expenses which was relevant to the issue of child maintenance. Mr Han also highlighted that there was an allegation that substantial amounts of money had been transferred to various individuals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It was, however, apparent to me that the real dispute between parties lay in the relevant period of disclosure in relation to Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In that connection, counsel for the Husband, Ms Amelia Lim (“Ms Lim”) made the point that because the operative date for identifying the matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, the relevant period for disclosure for both Items 1 and 2 ought to be from the time the marriage had broken down irretrievably in August 2023 to the date of the interim judgment which had been granted in February 2024 (see above at [2]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On that basis, the Husband had already given disclosure of the relevant documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is indeed useful for the court to have an insight into parties’ finances during the breakdown of the marriage and prior to the filing of divorce proceedings: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [79] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19]. The rationale for this, as was explained in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em> at [19], is that during the breakdown of the marriage, there would be a “proportionate decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances and financial arrangements”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, although parties were agreed that the marriage had broken down by August 2023, it was clear to me, upon perusing both the Husband’s Statement of Particulars and the Wife’s Defence that their relationship was, at the start of 2023, already experiencing some strain. For example, the Husband writes, in his Statement of Particulars, that “[s]ometime in late 2022 or early 2023, he had become very frustrated” with the Wife’s online shopping habits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Wife on the other hand, set out in her Defence, that their marriage was, right from the beginning, short of emotional and physical intimacy – she set out instances of how the Husband would rebuff her efforts at intimacy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Given this, I considered that the starting period of disclosure in January 2023 was indeed a reasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Turning to address the ending period of disclosure, I do not accept Ms Lim’s argument that the relevant period for disclosure should end with the grant of the interim judgment. While it is true that the date of the interim judgment is generally taken as the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets – as I had noted in an earlier judgment, it must be remembered that this is not a rule writ in stone: <em>XAY v XAZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 60</a> at [11]. The court does have the discretion to depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case warrant it: <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [34] – [36]; <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Ms Lim did raise the point, during the hearing before me, that if the court hearing the ancillary matters did eventually decide to use a date after the grant of the interim judgment as its starting point in determining the pool of matrimonial assets, the court could always ask parties to tender copies of their bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This is, at first blush, an attractive argument. However, it overlooks the point of the discovery process – that it is not only meant to ensure that all the relevant evidence is placed before the judge hearing the matter (see <em>XCL v XCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a> at [4]; <em>VisionHealthOne Corp Pte Ltd v HD Holdings Pte Ltd and others (Chan Wai Chuen and another, third parties)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 9 at [20]), but it also allows parties to evaluate their cases and clarify issues in dispute (see <em>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0947.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 947</a> at [24] citing <em>Teo Wai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0573.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 573</a> at [41]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In this vein, the documents which the Wife sought for the period after the grant of the interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, from March to August 2024) were indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would allow parties to evaluate their positions as to whether the operative date for determining the matrimonial pool of assets should indeed be taken as the date of the interim judgment. And even if one accepts that the date of the interim judgment would remain as the operative date, these documents would have a bearing on the issue of child maintenance as they cast light on the state of the Husband’s finances after the grant of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore allow the Wife’s application for discovery in Items 1 and 2. It is ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Annex A of SUM 3413, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 17<sup>th</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Parties are to write in with their submissions on the costs of SUM 3413, which shall be no longer than 3 pages. This shall be done no later than 10 January 2025. The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Lim and Mr Han for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at paras 16 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at paras 14 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 4(e).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defence at paras 2(i) – 2(l).</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4676 of 2023 (Summons No 3168 of 2024)","title":"XGI v XGJ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 5","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32716-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh & Co) for the plaintiff","Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XGI v XGJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGI <em>v</em> XGJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32716-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 5</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4676 of 2023 (Summons No 3168 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh &amp; Co) for the plaintiff; Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XGI — XGJ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 3168/2024 (“SUM 3168”). That summons had been taken out by the Wife who sought leave to file a joint affidavit from her four daughters to address issues relating to certain items of gold jewellery. My decision in respect of SUM 3168 can be found in <em>XGI v XGJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32622-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 110</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ respective submissions on the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband’s position was that the issue of costs should be addressed at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In any case, parties should bear their own costs as they are both legally aided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On the other hand, the Wife’s position was that, although both parties were legally aided, the Husband should still be liable for costs, to the tune of $2500, pursuant to s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAA”) as he had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. These costs should be paid to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where costs are sought against legally aided persons, there are two relevant provisions (<em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). The first is s 12(4)(<em>c</em>) of the LAA which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where any Grant of Aid is so filed, the aided person —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    is not, except where express provision is made in this Act, liable for costs to any other party in any proceedings to which the Grant of Aid relates; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second is s 14 of the LAA. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Court may order payment of costs by aided person in certain event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.—(1)    Where it appears to a court that any of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3) exists in relation to an aided person, the court may order the aided person to pay the costs of all or any of the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Director;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the solicitor who acted for the aided person;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In subsection (1), a reference to an “aided person” includes, in any case where the Grant of Aid has been cancelled before the making of the order, the person who immediately before the cancellation was the aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Grant of Aid issued to the aided person has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the aided person acted improperly in bringing or defending any legal proceedings, or in the conduct of those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where an order is made under subsection (1), the costs must be taxed as if the party ordered to pay costs were not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The costs so ordered to be paid must, unless otherwise directed by the order, include —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), were expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or were advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs of the Director or the solicitor who acted for the aided person ordered to be paid under subsection (1) include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5), then if any amount is recovered by the Director in respect of such costs, the same must be applied in the first instance in or towards the satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that the Wife is invoking s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) to argue that the Husband should be liable for costs despite being legally aided, she bears the burden of showing that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. In that vein, the mere fact that the Husband did not prevail in his bid to have SUM 3168 dismissed is not, in of itself, evidence that he had acted improperly. The Wife must put forward evidence to show that the Husband had conducted his “defence in a way that a reasonable [respondent] would not”: <em>Anpex Pte Ltd v Cheng Yong Sun and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29042-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 294</a> at [4].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s basis for saying that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168 appears to be that the Husband was lying in his affidavits when it came to the issue of the gold jewellery. The Wife points out that in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means, he had alleged that the jewellery was removed by the Wife from the matrimonial flat, and that the jewellery had been acquired during the course of their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, appears to shift his position because in a Reply Affidavit filed later on the 12<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, he denied the “existence and/or true value of the…gold jewellery items” which had been purchased by the Wife and their children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the circumstances, the costs of SUM 3168 shall be reserved to the judge hearing the ancillary matters. It is apparent to me that the issue of whether the Husband had acted improperly in resisting the Wife’s application is linked to the issue of who had bought and paid for the gold jewellery, as well as the truth of whatever the Husband had said in the various affidavits he had filed. These are matters to be decided by the judge hearing the ancillary matters, and the judge’s findings in respect of these issues may have a bearing on whether the Husband had indeed acted improperly in resisting the Wife’s application in SUM 3168.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As a final point, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions on Costs at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions on Costs at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Applicant seeking costs on the basis that he had been partially successful in his application to vary orders relating to his daughter’s care and control and access","Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Respondent seeking costs on the basis that the applicant had acted unreasonably by failing to resolve the issues amicably without the need for litigation","Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Approach to awarding costs in matrimonial proceedings"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/D No. 1721 of 2023 (FC/SUM No. 2056 of 2024)","title":"XER v XES","citation":"[2025] SGFC 4","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32715-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Khin Wee (M/s I.R.B.

They are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Starting position</em>. Under of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR</b>”), the starting position is that “costs should follow the event” – i.e., in usual cases, the successful party should be given the costs of the application or action: r 852(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Therapeutic justice</em>. However, the FJR also provides that a court is free to depart from the starting position if the “circumstances of the case” warrant it: r 852(2). In this regard, courts <em>frequently decline to make costs orders</em> at the end of matrimonial proceedings: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<b><em>JBB</em></b>”) at [24] to [27]. There are at least two reasons for this. <em>First</em>, it is often hard to say which party has “succeeded” in such proceedings. <em>Second</em>, a costs order may also be perceived as a signal that one party has “won” and the other has “lost”. Courts prefer not to send such a signal as this may increase acrimony and discontent between the parties – and thus undermine the aims of therapeutic justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Parties’ conduct.</em> The judicial preference of not ordering costs does not mean that costs orders will never be made in matrimonial proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       This is because when determining whether there is a need to make costs orders, courts are <em>statutorily obliged</em> to consider the <em>parties’ conduct</em> before and during the proceedings. This includes considering whether they have made any attempt to resolve their dispute: r 854 of the FJR (“must”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In this regard, a court “may” make a costs order, <em>including against a successful party</em>, if a party “has failed to establish any claim or issue which he has raised”, and “has thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted or added to the costs or complexity [of the proceedings]”: r 865 of the FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Courts have held that a costs order would be justified –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Where one party had made a genuine and reasonable offer to settle the matrimonial proceedings, and the matter could have been settled without the need for litigation: <em>WLL v WLM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29872-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 30</a> at [7], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       To signal that the adversarial stance taken by a party is not acceptable in a family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To sum up – it is appropriate to make costs orders to deter conduct which is contrary to the principles of therapeutic justice. If the appropriate signal is not sent, then parties who act reasonably may feel exploited by those who do not subscribe to such principles. Over time, confidence in the practice of therapeutic justice will be eroded and this is detrimental to our family justice system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs ought to be ordered against the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Following from [4] above, whether the Father has succeeded in part, or has been “completely unsuccessful” in SUM 2056 is not determinative of whether costs should be ordered: see [2(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Instead, the more pertinent issue is whether the Father’s or the Mother’s conduct of SUM 2056 warrants a costs order against him/her: <em>JBB</em> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On this issue, I find that a costs order should be made against the Father. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 1 and 2 – Sale of matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with Prayers 1 and 2. They are the Father’s application –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     for extension of time to sell the matrimonial flat: Prayer 1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to have sole conduct of such a sale: Prayer 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9        <em>Father’s allegations</em>. To support these prayers, the Father alleged the following in an affidavit dated 30 August 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">36.    There is currently <em>no confirmation when</em> such completion will be, <em>if at all</em>. There is a chance that the completion may eventually be called off given the current buyer’s increasing financial penalties for delaying completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37.    It is <em>now 30 August 2024</em>, and the Matrimonial Flat’s completion is <em>still being delayed indefinitely</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">38.    Parties thus now require an extension of time for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The above allegations give the impression that as of 30 August 2024 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The completion for the sale of the flat had been delayed indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father did not have any confirmation as to when the completion would take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He did not know if the completion would ever happen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Allegations are false</em>. The Father’s allegations are clearly false given the following undisputed evidence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In a letter dated 21 August 2024 (i.e., nine days <em>before</em> the Father’s affidavit was filed), HDB had already written to the Mother and him to <em>confirm</em> the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The “<em>effective</em> date for resale” of the flat “<em>has been fixed</em> on <u>30/8/2024</u>” (underscore in original text, italics added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father and the Mother were to pay the flat’s “service/conservancy charges up to 30/08/24” with the town council.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]here should be no outstanding service/conservancy and lift upgrading charges due to the Town Council on the resale effective date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There is no suggestion that the completion date of 30 August 2024 would be postponed. In fact, in so far as HDB is concerned, the <em>completion was to proceed as scheduled</em>. This is clear from two letters (dated 22 August 2024) which HDB had sent to the parties. In these letters, HDB specifically informed them of the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The parties had to pay $38,886.68 to settle the completion of account for the resale of the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “The completion of the resale transaction has been scheduled for you to <em>sign the legal documents</em> and <em>hand over the keys</em> to the flat”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The completion would be on <em>30 August 2024</em> at <em>3.30 pm</em> at the HDB Hub, Resale Office. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It is clear that the Father and the Mother had no intention to postpone the completion date of 30 August 2024. In a document dated 22 August 2024, the Father had confirmed with HDB that the Mother and he “<em>will handover the house keys</em> as there are no extension of stay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There is also no evidence to show that the buyer(s) had between 21 to 30 August 2024 asked to postpone the completion fixed on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The completion eventually proceeded on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Father’s position on the false allegations</em>. The Father denied that the allegations were false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His counsel submitted unconvincingly that (i) the Father’s allegations referred to the “actual act of completion where parties sign all the documents and complete the transaction”, and (ii) 30 August 2024 was only the “anticipated completion date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s counsel also submitted that the allegations were merely “outdated” and not false. To support this submission, counsel stated that the Father’s affidavit was confirmed on 29 August 2024 and signed in the morning of 30 August 2024 – i.e., <em>before</em> the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I find these submissions to be disingenuous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Father could have waited until <em>after</em> 3.30 pm (i.e., the scheduled completion time) to file his affidavit. If the completion did not proceed as scheduled, he could then state this accordingly in his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, based on the eLit records, the Father’s affidavit was filed only at 5.42 pm – i.e., two hours <em>after</em> the time fixed for the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, after the completion of the flat, the Father would have known that (1) the completion had concluded successfully and (2) the evidence/impression which he had conveyed in [9] and [10] are “erroneous” (to use counsel’s description). During the hearing, the Father’s counsel agreed that a reasonable person would have taken steps to correct this “error” – e.g., by expeditiously informing his counsel to clarify the matter during the case conference on 10 September 2024 or by filing a supplemental affidavit. The Father had failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Unnecessary work done</em>. As a result of the Father’s conduct (false allegations and failure to correct them), the Mother had to seek the leave of court to file a further affidavit to clarify that the flat had already been sold. This affidavit was filed on 17 September 2024. It was only after this further affidavit that the Father’s counsel informed the Mother’s counsel that Prayers 1 and 2 would be withdrawn. This took place only on 23 September 2024 – i.e., about three weeks after the completion of the resale of the matrimonial flat. By then, unnecessary work has been done by the Wife and her counsel to address Prayers 1 and 2. The Father’s conduct is clearly unacceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 3 – Variation of Daughter’s caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to Prayer 3 of SUM 2056, which is the Father’s application to replace the Mother as the Daughter’s caregiver. By way of a quick re-cap, the Father had made the application on two grounds. <em>First</em>, he had discovered his Daughter’s photos on social media which show her to be in an allegedly inappropriate pose and in the company of “strangers”. According to the Father, this showed that the Mother had failed to protect the Daughter’s interests. <em>Second</em>, he alleged that the Mother had denied him access to the Daughter: Judgement at [12] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I dismissed Prayer 3 because I found it to be dubious and “utterly devoid of merit”: Judgement at [23] to [35]. There is no evidence to show that the Father had approached the Mother to clarify matters <em>before</em> seeking this prayer. In my view, he could have addressed his concerns expeditiously and easily by simply checking with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 4 and 5 – Variation of non-family members clause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I now turn to Prayers 4 and 5. The Father had wanted the following clause to be completely deleted from the AM Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother objected to the complete deletion of this clause because she was concerned for the Daughter’s safety if she was with strangers. The Mother was however prepared to be flexible, and she proposed the following variation to the non-family members clause:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Save for the Plaintiff’s romantic partner, the </u> <del>The Plaintiff’s</del> access shall not be in the presence of non-family members<u>, unless the Plaintiff obtains the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I note that as early as 2 August 2024, the Mother had already proposed her variation in [17] to the Father in her Offer To Settle (“<b>OTS</b>”). The Father did not accept the offer. Neither did he attempt to address the Mother’s concerns, e.g., by counter-proposing suitable text. It is the Father’s case that he did not trust her enough to negotiate on a mutually acceptable access clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I agree with the Mother that Prayers 4 and 5 could have been resolved much earlier if the Father had adopted a problem-solving approach and proposed modifications to the Mother’s OTS.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Indeed, I had noted that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… during the proceedings, the Father had largely stuck to his positions and did not make much effort to address the Mother’s concerns arising from his application. In contrast, in line with the spirit of therapeutic justice, the Mother had shown flexibility and reasonableness – e.g., by suggesting suitable language for varying the access orders.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I eventually varied the non-family members’ clause as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>ii</u>)    <b><u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[variation in underscore] [bolding added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although I had eventually allowed Prayers 4 and 5, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother’s variations and the ones that I have ordered are substantively similar, save the text in bold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Father did not make any contribution towards the formulation of the varied clause that I have ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 6 – Modes of child access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, I come to Prayer 6. In this prayer, the Father had sought to expand the manner in which he could exercise access to the Daughter. I had found the Father’s proposed variations in Prayer 6 to be “problematic”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I eventually accepted the Mother’s proposed variations which, in my view, “strikes the right balance between flexibility and certainty regarding the manner of the handover”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother’s proposed variations are not new – she had already proposed them to the Father in her OTS in August 2024. In my view, it is unreasonable for him to reject the Mother’s proposed variations. Litigation on Prayer 6 could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To sum-up, I agree with the Mother that in relation to the issues in SUM 2056, valuable time and resources have been wasted because of the Father’s uncompromising stance, even when she had made a reasonable OTS. The Father has failed to substantiate his bare allegation that “it was reasonable for [him] to not try to negotiate further with the [Mother]” at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father cannot continue with such an attitude. The Daughter is only eight years old. For the next 13 years, he will need to work together with the Mother on matters relating to their Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, it is necessary to make a costs order against the Father to clearly signal to him that he needs to be more reasonable moving forward, and to compensate the Mother for the costs that she had unnecessarily incurred in the Father’s pursuit of SUM 2056.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Amount of costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, an order of <b>$6,500 (all in)</b> would be appropriate in this case. In coming to this amount, I have considered (a) the extent of work done, and (b) the fact that the Mother had shown flexibility in trying to resolve the issues early – by making an OTS and through the facilitative conduct of her counsel during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The terms of the OTS are substantially similar to those that I have ordered. Admittedly, the Mother’s proposal regarding the non-family members clause did not go far enough: Judgement at [48] and [49]. That said, I do not think that this is due to a lack of genuine efforts on her part to resolve the access issue. I am satisfied that her OTS was made in good faith. If only the Father had kept an open mind and proposed suitable language to the non-family members’ clause to address the Mother’s concern, the issue could have been resolved with the need for litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father is to pay $6,500 to DBS Account No. 014-904xx by 27 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32      <em>First</em>, to support his claim that it was not reasonable for him to negotiate with the Mother, the Father submitted that after my decision on Prayers 4 and 5, the Wife had refused to allow him to bring the Daughter to visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I am unable to accept the Father’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     To support his submissions, the Father had relied on his chat records with the Mother. I find that these records are <em>not admissible</em> – they are annexed to the Father’s submissions and are not adduced by way of affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father had omitted the rest of the parties’ conversation, and that there was no evidence that the Daughter could not visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations.

Having considered parties’ evidence and submissions, I made various orders relating to the child’s care arrangements, including an order for the Defendant Mother to have sole care and control of the child, and orders providing for the Father’s access to the Child. The Father has since appealed against the whole of my decision. I now set out herein the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties are both Indian nationals. They married on 4 August 2017 in India. The Father is on an Employment Pass, while the Mother is on an S Pass, that was extended until 10 August 2027.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The child of the marriage was born on 8 November 2018 (the “Child”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father had been living in Singapore prior to the marriage. The Mother lived in India, but moved to Singapore to join the Father after the marriage. The parties lived in rental premises throughout the marriage, first in a property at Pegu Road, and thereafter in an apartment at Henderson Road, where the Father continued to live in as at the date of hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that sometime in April 2023, the Mother left their rented apartment with the Child, taking the Child’s passport with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Sometime in May 2024, the Mother and the Child travelled to India. While the Mother returned to Singapore thereafter, the Child remained there, living with the Mother’s parents. The Father did not know that the Child had travelled to India or that the Child has been living there until the Mother revealed this at a Family Dispute Resolution (“FDR”) Conference on 5 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 29 May 2024, the Father filed the present application. Sometime in August 2024, the Mother filed for a divorce in Bangalore, India. In this regard, the Mother asked that the present proceedings be stayed for the court in Bangalore to determine the Child’s custody issues. As there was no application filed by the Mother to stay the present proceedings, I declined to do so, and proceeded to hear this matter on 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Apart from the present proceedings, the parties had previously applied for a personal protection order against each other: the Mother in SS 1624/2022, and the Father in SS 635/2023. A PPO was issued in respect of SS 1624/2022, restraining the Father from committing family violence against the Mother. SS 635/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s application </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In his application, the Father sought the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Mother be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother shall handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping, and that the Father’s solicitors shall not handover the passport to anyone until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the Father be granted interim care and control of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That the Father be granted interim liberal access to the Child pending the resolution of the matter, or until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     That the Mother produces the Child before the court within 7 days of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Among the reasons given by the Father, the Father said that the Mother has been unduly restrictive with his access to the Child. The Father said that the Mother would make various unilateral decisions without consulting him, and suggested that she has been less than cooperative as a parent. The Father said that the Mother is unsuited to be the Child’s main caregiver because “<em>she has no qualm [sic] in using [the Child] as a tool to control the Father and she does not care whether there is a healthy father relationship between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Father said that there is a <em>“pressing need for him to see the Child to determine if further medical care is required</em>” in the wake of the Child’s operation in April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Father says that he has “<em>suffered from being completely cut off from [the Child] since November 2023 and [he] can no longer endure it as [he] truly miss[es] [the Child] a lot</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When faced with an application filed under Section 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934, the court is foremost guided by doing what is in the Child’s best interests. The court is less concerned about achieving equity or equality between parents. There is, after all, no standing presumption that both parents should have equal responsibility over, or equal time with, their child (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> at [12] and [20]). Each party’s behaviour toward the other, or indeed their respective contributions toward the marriage, are relevant to the extent that it affects the child in question. This may be the case where, for example, a party’s actions may have a direct or indirect impact on their ability to care for their child, or on their child’s relationship with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I therefore examined the reasons for the Father’s application, and considered, based on his reasons, how the orders sought by the Father would advance the Child’s best interests, rather than that of either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence provided, I found some force to the Father’s arguments that the Mother had not been cooperative as a joint parent and that she had not been facilitative of the Father spending time with the Child. For instance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From April 2023 to the time of hearing, which was a span of nearly one and a half years, the Father only met the Child once in person. This was in public, and in the Mother’s presence, at VivoCity on 8 November 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from this brief access in November 2023, the Father only had two video calls with the Child which lasted for about three to four minutes each;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whereas the Child had been attending a preschool at Redhill Close, the Mother withdrew the Child on 31 December 2022 and enrolled him into a different preschool at Henderson Crescent. The Mother did not consult the Father, nor did she inform him of this before effecting the withdrawal and enrolment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother arranged for the Child to undergo an adenoidectomy in India in April 2024 without consulting or informing the Father. The Mother says that she informed the Father’s mother, but never received any queries from her or the Father. At the hearing, the Mother said that she did not think that the Father would be interested, and acknowledged that she should have informed the Father but did not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There was evidence that even when the parties were living together, the Mother was less than forthcoming about the Child’s whereabouts. For instance, WhatsApp messages between 8 October to 29 October 2022 suggested that there were various occasions where the Father would ask to see the Child, or ask about the Child, without any response from the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The WhatsApp messages on 21 and 22 January 2023 suggested that the Mother had taken the Child on a “stay holiday” without informing the Father. Despite the Father’s message at 8.54am on 22 January 2023 requesting the Mother to bring the Child back earlier for lunch, or for her to inform him of the Child’s whereabouts and the time they would be returning, the Mother only responded to the message at 11.47pm without providing any of the information sought, though they had yet to return at that late hour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     There was also some evidence that the Mother had spoken uncharitably of the Father in front of the Child. For instance, a transcript of a recorded conversation shows that the Mother told the Child that the Father “<em>is not your father because he doesn’t take care. He is not your father. You no need to call him Abbu. He doesn’t take any responsibility.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> At pages 168 to 169 of FA1, a transcript of another recorded conversation suggests that the Child told the Father that the Mother “<em>threatens [the Father]</em>” and that he is “<em>also afraid of her</em>”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On the evidence provided, when the Father tried to initiate access, the Mother appeared slow to respond, or else did not respond at all. For instance, on 22 April 2023, the Father requested for some video call access, but the Mother did not respond to this at all. On 9 September 2023, the Father requested to see the Child at 3.00pm the next day, but the Mother only responded at 3.09pm on 10 September 2023 to say that she was unwell, after the Father sent another message at 2.37pm that day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Taken at face value, the Mother’s actions, as described by the Father, suggest that she may have been inclined to fetter the Father’s time with the Child and to exclude him from making significant decisions relating to the Child. However, I also noted the following, which I found to have diluted the strength of the Father’s claim and reduced the culpability of the Mother’s actions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Despite the Father’s claims that he had made multiple requests for access, I noted that there was limited evidence showing this. For instance, a screenshot of WhatsApp messages between them showed that after the Father’s request for a video call with the Child on 22 April 2023, which the Mother did not respond to, the Father did not send another message or make any other request to the Mother until 8 August 2023, when the Father requested to take the Child out for the afternoon.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence provided on affidavit that explained this gap in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Similarly, there was no evidence of the Father asking about the Child’s well-being, whether on a consistent basis or otherwise. In this regard, there appears to be some truth to the Mother’s messages sent to the Father on 10 September 2023 at 3.16pm and 3.24pm, namely that the Father only wanted to spend time with the Child at his own convenience, and that he had not been asking how the Child was doing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence that the Father replied to these messages, and the Father did not provide an explanation for these messages in his affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, with respect to the Father’s access on 8 November 2023, the Mother’s evidence was that when they met, the Father “<em>could not control his anger and temper and began shouting and cursing at [the Mother] in front of [the Child</em>]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This was supported by a screenshot of WhatsApp messages she had sent to the Father, recording her displeasure at how the access went. The Father did not specifically dispute this, nor did he adduce any further WhatsApp messages to refute or to provide further context to the Mother’s messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In any event, while the Father argues that the Mother’s actions may have had a consequential adverse effect on the Father’s relationship with the Child, the relationship between the parent and child is but one of the factors that the court considers in its assessment the child’s welfare (see <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [51]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the balance of things, I was not persuaded that the Father should have sole care and control of the Child, as sought by him. Rather, I was of the view that the Child would benefit from continuing to reside with his primary caregiver. On the evidence, this appeared to be the Mother, not the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     One month after the Child was born, the Mother returned to India with the Child. The Child therefore spent his first year under the Mother’s primary care with limited physical involvement from the Father. After the Mother and the Child returned to Singapore in December 2019, there was little evidence adduced to suggest that the Father took over the role as the Child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Father claimed to have been very much involved in the Child’s life, the Father’s best evidence of his involvement was that he fed his son well, took him to his favourite indoor playgrounds alone, and purchased baby supplies for him. He said that on occasion, he would “<em>give [the Child] a shower, put on a suit, and clean his poop</em>”, and that every time the Child was ill, he would take him to the clinic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Father also pointed to his efforts in applying for a student pass for the Child, but I did not think that this necessarily indicated his level of involvement in the Child’s day to day affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At paragraph 3.7 of MA1, the Mother alleged that the <em>“only interest [the Father] showed in [the Child] was limited to taking him out to indoor playgrounds for a couple of hours over the weekend or taking him to his sister’s house in Jurong East”</em>. The Father had the opportunity to respond to this but did not do more than make a blanket statement that “<em>these allegations are false</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Father never provided much detail as to any other activities or events he would take the Child to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On the face of the evidence, I could not accept that the Father was a primary, or even an equal, caregiver during the marriage. I found that the Father likely bore the responsibility of being the main breadwinner of the family, but took on more of a supporting role when it came to parenting the Child. In contrast, the fact that the Mother was primarily responsible for caring for the Child during the marriage, as well as the Mother’s ability to physically care for the Child, were not seriously disputed. Rather, the Father’s main charge about the Mother’s suitability as a caregiver was that “<em>the [Mother] is not a suitable caregiver to [the Child] presently given her tendency to destroy the parental link between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I ultimately found that the Child had, throughout his life, mostly been reliant on the Mother and that it would be remiss to remove the Child from the Mother’s care. As the Child’s primary caregiver, the Mother would be better placed to attend to the Child’s physical and emotional needs, and provide the Child with a sense of stability amidst this period of transition. Further, I found that much of the Father’s concerns may be addressed through appropriate orders on custody and access, and do not in itself justify the order of sole care and control that he sought. <u>I therefore found that the Mother should be granted sole care and control of the Child</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     With respect to the Father’s access to the Child, the Father’s position was that he should have liberal access to the Child, if care and control was not granted to him. The Mother did not object to the Father having access, but said that this should take place in India. Otherwise, any access in Singapore should be in her presence, and should not be accompanied by any other members of the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the Mother said that the Child has been much happier in India, there was little evidence to support this. The Mother provided scant details of the Child’s routine and living arrangements to the court, and it appears that prior to the FDR Conference on 5 August 2024, the Mother did not even inform the Father of this significant development. I did not find the Mother’s decision to take the Child to Bangalore for a surgery, and then to effectively relocate the Child there, to be reasonable or justified. If this surgery was indeed necessary, I did not see why the Mother could not undergo the surgery here in Singapore. The Mother did not satisfactorily explain this (and never cited finances as a reason for doing so).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Further, the Mother’s case that the Child’s best interests would be best served in India was not substantiated on the evidence. The circumstances of the Mother taking the Child to India, without informing the Father and without any court application to do so, lend itself to the inference that the Mother herself may not have felt that she had such a strong case in that regard. I found the Mother’s reasons for not informing the Father of her decisions to have been unsatisfactory. I therefore did not deem it appropriate to effectively affirm the Mother’s actions by ordering any access to take place in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Rather, I found on the circumstances of the case that the Father should have regular access with the Child, and that such access should take place in Singapore. Notwithstanding the Mother’s misgivings, there is no evidence to suggest that the Father is unable to exercise access with the Child, particularly where it is not disputed that he had previously taken the Child out on his own to indoor playgrounds when the Child was younger. The Father should be given the opportunity to establish – or re-establish – his relationship with the Child, and to be the parent that the Mother says he has never been.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, given the length of time since the Father had any substantial time with the Child, I was of the view that such access should be exercised on an incremental basis. I did not find the liberal access suggested by the Father to be in the Child’s best interests, and I also noted from the requests made by the Father to the Mother for access over the past one and a half years that he never asked for any overnight access with the Child, or even for a period of much longer than a few hours. As the Child has been living in India for nearly six months as at the time of the hearing, I allowed a transition period of two weeks before access was to commence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I therefore ordered that the <u>Father has reasonable access to the Child</u> in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from the week commencing 25 November 2024, the Father shall spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall continue to spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. The Mother is not to be present during this access without the Father’s consent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the above period of 3 months, the Father shall continue to spend 3 hours each week either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. In addition, the Father is to have access to the Child for dinner after school on a weekday. The Mother is not to be present during this access without the Father’s consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As neither party raised any concrete proposals for access arrangements, I left it to the parties to make the necessary arrangements between themselves. However, <u>if the parties were unable to agree to this in writing within 7 days of my order</u>, the Father’s access was to take place as such:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from 30 November 2024, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the above period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall handover the Child to the Father at the void deck of the Father’s place of residence, and the Father shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. In addition, the Father shall have access on Wednesdays, after the Child’s school, or from 5.00pm (whichever is earlier) until 8.00pm. The Father shall pick the Child up directly from school and shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given my above orders for the Mother to personally bring the Child for the access sessions, I did not find it necessary to order that the Child be produced before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While the Father did not make any express prayers for custody orders (despite him seeking an order for sole custody in his written submissions), I found that it would be beneficial to make an order for the <u>parties to share joint custody of the Child</u>. I was of the view that in the context of this case, such an order clearly affirming both parties’ equal right to make major decisions for the Child such as the Child’s choice of school and the Child’s country of residence would avert any acrimony between the parties stemming from one party making any such decisions unilaterally, which may inadvertently have an impact on the Child’s relationship with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With respect to prayers 1 and 2 of the Father’s application (namely for the Mother to be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders, and for the Mother to handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping pending further orders), given that the Child was already overseas, and given my orders for the Mother to have sole care and control of the Child, I made no orders with respect to these prayers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In relation to the issue of costs, the Father sought costs of $4,000 (all-in). The Father’s counsel argued that this application was necessitated by the Mother’s actions, that the Father’s application was mainly for access, that it was the Mother who made it difficult for the parties to resolve the matter, and that the hearing of the matter was delayed, with a number of case conferences necessitated before the hearing of the matter. The Mother’s response was that she could not afford to pay costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I made no order as to costs. The Father had expressly sought an order for sole custody and care and control, and never made any concessions in this regard. I therefore did not agree that his application was primarily about the issue of access. In this regard, the Father did not find any success in his requests for sole custody and care and control. I also did not agree that the parties’ inability to resolve the matter prior to hearing was solely the Mother’s fault. I noted that the parties had been fixed to attend FDR Mediation, but that it was the Father who chose to withdraw from this after parties had attended the FDR Conference. I also noted that there were only two case conferences convened prior to the hearing on 16 October 2024, which was not an unduly high number, and that the Mother had only filed one affidavit in this matter, whereas the Father had filed four of his own. I overall did not find any order for costs to be warranted in the circumstances of the case.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 300 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 28 May 2024 (“FA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 13 June 2024 (“FA2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 13 of the Father’s Written Submissions dated 7 October 2024 (“FS1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 14 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Pages 77 to 81 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Pages 212 to 215 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Page 151 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 168 and 169 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Page 272 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 271 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Page 274 and 275 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 3.10 of the Mother’s Affidavit dated 26 August 2024 (“MA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 on page 139 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 12 September 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of FA2</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial proceedings – Jurisdiction – Whether parties who have consented to the grant of interim judgment entitled to a stay of ancillary reliefs on the ground of forum non conveniens","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Pre-nuptial agreements – Whether case management stay should be granted pending conclusion of foreign proceedings on validity of pre-nuptial agreement","Conflict of laws – Natural forum – Stay of proceedings – Whether Singapore court is an appropriate forum in light of concurrent foreign proceedings"],"date":"2025-01-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 249 of 2023, (Summons No. 930 of 2022)","title":"XFS v XFT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 1","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32700-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Chiok Beng Piow (AM Legal LLC) and Ms Chuah Hui Fen Christine (D' Bi An LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mr Ivan Cheong, Mr Shaun Ho and Ms Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XFS v XFT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XFS <em>v</em> XFT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

That effectively meant that the stay of proceedings he had sought in SUM 930 would relate only to the proceedings for ancillary matters (“AM”) relief in D 249 since the grounds for the parties’ divorce were already fully and finally determined in the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Following the grant of the IJ, the Husband applied for and obtained permission from the Court to formally amend SUM 930 to refer only to the AM reliefs sought in the pleadings,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as well as to include a general reference to all the legal proceedings which were pending before the Israeli courts (“Israeli Proceedings”). By that time, there were multiple lawsuits between the parties in Israel. I will address the Israeli Proceedings in greater detail later on in these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       By the time SUM 930 was heard by this Court, it transpired that much of the Israeli Proceedings have concluded, save that the Husband’s appeal against part of the Israeli Family Court’s earlier decision (“Israeli Appeal”) has not yet been heard. As such, the Husband – through his counsel – sought a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249. The effect of such a stay would be that the remainder of the divorce proceedings, <em>ie.</em> the proceedings for AM reliefs (“AM Proceedings”), would be brought to an immediate end.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 21 October 2024, I delivered my oral grounds of decision in respect of SUM 930. In summary, I dismissed the Husband’s application for a permanent stay and ordered that there be a limited case management stay of D 249 pending the conclusion of his Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Both parties have since appealed against my decision, <em>vide.</em> HCF/RAS 20/2024 and RAS 21/2024. These are my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given the procedural posture of the present proceedings, there was some initial debate between the parties’ counsel as to whether the Husband’s stay application remained grounded on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This issue arose because despite the prayers in SUM 930 referring to phrase “<em>forum non conveniens</em>”, much of the Husband’s counsel’s arguments was focused on the impact and relevance of the parallel Israeli Proceedings, and the concern with multiplicity of proceedings in two jurisdictions, <em>ie.</em> Israel and Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Notwithstanding the somewhat unusual turn of events, I agreed with the Husband’s counsel that the principle of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remained a live issue between the parties, and was one of the legal bases relied upon by the Husband in support of SUM 930. This was evident from the fact that both counsel had filed detailed written submissions addressing this issue, and the principle itself was referred to in SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Moreover, the concerns as regards <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in the present case arose as a result of the Husband’s subsequent Israeli legal action against the Wife, as compared to D 249 which was the Wife’s initial divorce application in Singapore against the Husband. The situation thus fell within what the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Constructions Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1097.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Virsagi</em>”) had observed as being a “reversed parties situation”, <em>ie.</em> where a plaintiff sues a defendant in Singapore, and the same defendant then sues the plaintiff abroad (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [27]). The <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in such a situation operates <em>within</em> the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, and is to be considered under the rubric of the general principles applicable to the doctrine (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [38] and [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will therefore start by addressing the question of whether the Husband is entitled to seek a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the outset, I note that, in both parties’ written submissions, they accept that in considering the issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the Family Court would apply the principles set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> (or the “<em>Spiliada</em> test”) to determine whether a stay of divorce proceedings should be granted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I agree with the said approach as that is consistent with the prevailing caselaw: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a> and <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a>, Debbie Ong JC (as Her Honour then was) held as follows (at [14] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    It is well accepted in Singapore that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remains relevant in matrimonial proceedings, including proceedings involving the custody of children. The High Court in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> first made it clear that the <em>Spiliada</em> principles (derived from and named after the seminal case of <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”)) apply in matrimonial proceedings. Similarly, the High Court in <em>Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla (Danialle An, co-respondent)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> applied the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to divorce and related ancillary matters, citing [16] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 1 SLR(R) 0104.xml')\">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 104</a> which reads […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In gist, the <em>Spiliada</em> test is a factors-based test which starts with an assessment as to whether the applicant (in this case, the Husband) has shown that there exists another available forum which is more appropriate. If there is <em>prima facie</em> another more appropriate forum, the court will grant a stay unless there are “special circumstances” which justify refusing to grant the stay: see <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> at [21] – [24]. The latter is commonly referred to as the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     At the second stage, the burden shifts to the responding party (ie. the Wife in the present case) to show the presence of “special circumstances” by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused: see <em>AZS v AXR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0700.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 700</a> at [11]; <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a> at [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband is precluded from raising forum non conveniens</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As I had alluded to above, the present case is unique in that the parties agreed to hold SUM 930 in abeyance while allowing the IJ to be granted in relation to D 249 by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my judgment, I find the Husband’s agreement for the Singapore court to grant the IJ to be inimical to his claim that a stay should be granted on account of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)    <u>The Husband had accepted Singapore as the most appropriate forum</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To satisfy the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the Husband asserted that there exists another court (presumably, the Israeli court) which would be “more appropriate” than the Singapore court. However, such a claim cannot be sustained when he had himself accepted (and had, in fact, expressly agreed with the Wife) that the Singapore Family Court was the appropriate court to grant IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     What is of especial significance, in the present case, was that the IJ was granted on <em>both</em> the parties’ amended claim and counterclaim relating to their respective unreasonable behaviour. In other words, both the Wife and the Husband expressly invoked the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to put an end to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the Husband’s amended pleadings, his entire Defence (including his objection to the Singapore courts having jurisdiction to determine the AM Proceedings) was deleted. In the Husband’s amended Counterclaim, AM reliefs <em>from the Singapore Family Court</em> were expressly sought and for those same reliefs to be adjourned to be determined in Chambers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Husband thus recognised that the Singapore was the appropriate jurisdiction to grant AM reliefs and cannot then claim that there was a more appropriate forum elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)    <u>Whether a “partial stay” of divorce proceedings can be granted</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Does this mean that that the Husband cannot then seek a stay (or, in counsel’s submissions, a “partial” stay) of D 249 such that <em>only</em> the AM proceedings are stayed? In addressing this question, both counsel made extensive submissions on whether the concept of a partial stay was even applicable to divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Drawing from similar principles in the context of civil litigation, the Husband’s case was that the Singapore court can always grant a partial stay whenever a claimant has different claims against the same defendant. The court would then be at liberty to decide which claims ought to be stayed against the defendant (so that they could be pursued elsewhere), while allowing the other claims to proceed within the forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the present case, the Husband analogised the claims leading to the grant of the IJ (<em>viz.</em> the grounds for the divorce) as being one claim between the parties, and the AM Proceedings (for ancillary relief) being an entirely separate claim, with the latter capable of being stayed independently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While I acknowledge that a Singapore court can grant such “partial stays” in relation to commercial claims (as was recognised by the High Court in <em>Humpuss Sea Transport v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss</em>”)), the cases where the grant of such stays were discussed occurred in the context of a claimant having different civil claims (or causes of action) against the same defendant some of which could be pursued in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For example, the High Court in <em>Humpuss</em> (at [96] of the judgment) referred to a situation where part of a party’s claims arose from a specific jurisdiction’s statutory law. Where such claims are brought alongside other general claims, the statutory cause of action may sometimes be partially stayed in favour of that forum so as to discourage litigants from tacking on claims with no obvious connection to the forum to claims which do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     However, those principles (which makes sense in the context of civil litigation) do not sit well with, and <em>cannot</em> be easily analogised to, divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To begin with, the power of the Family Court to grant any form of AM relief is derived from (and consequent on) an interim judgment of divorce being granted to dissolve the parties’ marriage. In my view, one cannot exist without the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     There are no <em>separate</em> causes of action or claims within the context of divorce proceedings because a party cannot apply to the Singapore Family Court to independently divide assets or seek a maintenance order, under Chapter 4 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (“WC”), without first obtaining interim judgment from the same Singapore court. This is apparent from the statutory schema of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For example, s 112(1) of the WC (which is located within Chapter 4) gives the court the power to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets only “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Section 113(1)(b) similarly gives the court the power to order maintenance “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Indeed, s 123 (in Chapter 5 of the WC) likewise directs the court not to make final any judgment of divorce unless arrangements have been made for the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     While the present marriage does not involve children, what is clear from the overall context of the provisions in the WC is that proceedings for ancillary relief (which relate to the financial consequences of a divorce and, where applicable, child-related orders) are intimately connected with, and are <em>part of</em>, the same claim for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To put matters in perspective, prior to 2011, it was well acknowledged that there was a “gap” in Singapore’s matrimonial law because the Singapore court had no powers to grant any AM relief independently, if it was not the court which granted the judgment for the parties’ divorce (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>UFM v UFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24027-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 2 SLR 650</a> at [1]). Parliament then had to statutorily enact Chapter 4A of the WC to specifically allow former spouses who were divorced in another jurisdiction to apply to the Singapore court for financial relief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was thus not persuaded by the Husband’s argument that the AM Proceedings should be considered a separate claim or cause of action which can be “severed” from a claim for the dissolution of the parties’ marriage. They are two inter-connected parts of the same claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Accordingly, the Husband was not entitled to seek a stay (whether fully or partially) of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> given that he had submitted to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction and had accepted its appropriateness to determine the parties’ divorce. It followed therefore that, by the Husband’s actions, he had acknowledged that the Singapore court was <em>in fact</em> the appropriate court to hear and determine the AM Proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Israel is not a more appropriate forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, even if the Husband was entitled to seek an independent stay of the AM Proceedings (contrary to my decision above) and I had applied the <em>Spiliada</em> test, I would not have found Israel to be a more appropriate forum in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In my view, apart from the fact that there were (and possibly continues to be) legal proceedings in the Israeli courts which the Husband had commenced against the Wife, no other factor clearly points to Israel being the appropriate jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In this regard, I accept the Wife’s submissions that both parties registered and celebrated their marriage in Singapore, and had lived in Singapore both before and after their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They both applied for and had obtained Permanent Resident status in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife is now a Singapore citizen. They also worked in Singapore and have significant assets in Singapore, including two Singaporean companies – [SGD] Pte Ltd and [AML] Pte Ltd.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The fact that they may also have an asset overseas (in the United States of America) was, in my view, inconclusive – it certainly does not point to the Israeli court as being the “more appropriate” forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This is particularly so given that the stay sought by the Husband was only in relation to the AM reliefs to be granted by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Overall, I was satisfied that all relevant connecting factors point to Singapore as being the appropriate forum. The Husband’s request for a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> was therefore not made out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other Considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Before addressing the Husband’s other arguments, I wish to make clear that in reaching my conclusion that he was not entitled to seek a partial stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, I did not accept the Wife’s submission that because the WC was the “governing law” for marriages in Singapore,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> it meant that there were public policy considerations which would enjoin this Court to conclude that Singapore must be the most appropriate or, indeed, the only forum of choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the main, the Wife’s submission was that since the parties registered their marriage in Singapore, the “just and equitable” division of assets regime (or the legal concept of a deferred community of property) envisaged under the WC should be seen as a manifestation of public policy operating to favour Singapore as the only jurisdiction of choice when it comes to the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the context of modern-day marriages, spouses can come from different jurisdictions, geographical locations, and they can choose to register (or celebrate) their marriage in any number of countries. It does not seem logical to say that because the parties married in Singapore, <em>ipso facto</em>, Singapore’s domestic marriage laws must apply as a matter of “<em>public policy</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Family Court, in considering whether a stay of proceedings ought to be granted, will still have to weigh the relevant connecting factors pursuant to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. Where the parties had registered their marriage and the applicable marriage laws of that forum are, at best, one of several considerations and would not be dispositive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I should also add that my decision in the present case should not be taken as having expressed a definitive view that it is legally impermissible for spouses to agree to have their marriage dissolved in Singapore, but with the AM proceedings dealt with by another court, in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Parties may perhaps be entitled to come to an express agreement for such an outcome. Another possibility alluded to by the Husband’s counsel relates to the existence of legal frameworks in other jurisdictions which permit spouses to <em>first</em> apply for the division of their marital assets in that jurisdiction and then apply for divorce elsewhere, or <em>vice-versa</em>. If parties had agreed to take such a path, it might be possible that the divorce sought in Singapore relates only to the dissolution of their marriage. As these considerations were <em>not</em> present in this case, I express no firm views on these matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My decision in the SUM 930 should be limited to the particular facts of the present case – <em>ie.</em> where a party, having freely elected and consented to the Singapore Family Court granting an IJ to end his marriage and agreeing for his prayers for ancillary relief to be adjourned for determination, subsequently seeks to stay the consequent AM proceedings in favour of another jurisdiction on account of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In such a situation, I find that the party in question is not allowed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Should a Case Management Stay be granted? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Although the Husband was not, in my view, entitled to a stay of the D 249 on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, that was not the end of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Court can, in exercise of its discretion, grant a case management (or limited) stay if I were to find that there was a risk of multiplicity of proceedings if D 249 is allowed to proceed given the existence of the Israeli Proceedings. In deciding whether to do so, the Court must consider all the circumstances of the case, and determine whether there is a need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole: see <em>BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam and Ruth Agam</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 3 SLR 27</a> at [34] and [35]. For case management stays, it is not necessary for the Court to consider the principles governing <em>forum non conveniens</em>: see <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 1192.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 1192</a> at [47].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Although the Husband’s main case was that there should be a permanent stay of the D 249 (whether on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, or because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings) and not a limited case management stay, the issue of such a stay was nonetheless raised during oral submissions. It was also expressly referred to in the Wife’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As the grant of a case management stay was within this Court’s inherent powers, I find it relevant to discuss this issue in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Israeli Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering the issue of multiplicity of proceedings, I will first address the Israeli Proceedings which the Husband had relied on as a significant aspect of his case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It was common ground – both in the parties’ submissions and in their experts’ evidence – that there were two separate actions before the Israeli Family Court, <em>ie.</em> Suit No. 60180-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 1”) and Suit No. 5245-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It was also not disputed that Israeli Suit 1 dealt with the <em>financial</em> issues arising from a partnership agreement which parties had signed in March 2015 (“Partnership Agreement”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     On 24 October 2023, Judge Samuel Bar Yosef of the Israel Family Court gave his judgment in respect of Israeli Suit 1 (“1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment”). In the said Judgment, the court held that the Partnership Agreement was enforceable only in relation to the properties which the parties had “<em>accumulated until the date of marriage of the parties (January 16, 2020)</em>” and that it was “<em>not enforceable in regards</em> [sic] <em>to property that was accumulated after the marriage of the parties</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> For completeness, Judge Yosef’s decision also covered assets which were accumulated before marriage, but are connected to post-marital assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The second common ground between the parties was that part of Israeli Suit 2 was commenced to <em>enforce</em> the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment. This was what Judge Yosef had envisaged in the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli judgment when the learned judge stated in his Judgment that “<em>the implementation of the provisions of the</em> [Partnership Agreement]<em>, according to this ruling shall be conducted in a separate proceeding</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Israeli Suit 2 was thus the said “separate proceeding”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     However, it was clear from the evidence that Israeli Suit 2 covered <em>more</em> than the mere enforcement of the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment and/or the implementation of the Partnership Agreement (which provided that the Husband should be entitled to 80% of the relevant assets). The Husband had also sought additional reliefs in Israeli Suit 2 which covered the division of the parties’ <em>post-</em>marital assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The latter issue was one which the court in Israeli Suit 1 <em>did not</em> make orders for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The judgment for Israeli Suit 2 was delivered by Judge Yosef in April 2024 wherein the learned Judge granted the enforcement order sought by the Husband (arising from Israeli Suit 1) and, <em>in addition</em>, that the Husband was entitled to 50% of the assets accumulated <em>after</em> marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In dealing with the parties’ post-marital assets, Israeli Suit 2 had – in effect – determined what the Singapore court would have to decide in the AM Proceedings for D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     It follows from the matters discussed above that the relevance of the Israeli Proceedings and the parties’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> these proceedings formed a significant dispute between the parties in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In particular, the Husband focused his arguments on whether this Court should find the Wife as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts. The Husband’s case was that if this Court finds that the Wife had done so, she should then be bound by the judgments in both Israeli Suits 1 and 2, and this Court should not proceed with the AM Proceedings given that those reliefs had already been sought <em>and obtained</em> by the Husband in Israel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As regards the issue of submission to jurisdiction, I accept the Husband’s argument that the Wife did submit to the jurisdiction of the Israeli court in Israeli Suit 1. The Wife filed submissions in Israeli Suit 1 and had participated in the court hearings leading up to Judge Yosef’s judgment on 24 October 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This was not seriously disputed by the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     What was more controversial was whether the Wife had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts (whether voluntarily or otherwise) in relation to Israeli Suit 2. The Husband’s primary position was that Israeli Suit 2 was merely a “continuation” and/or “enforcement” proceeding following on from Israeli Suit 1 and that this Court should consider both Suits in the Israeli Family Court as being one and the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     While much ink was spilled in both parties’ written submissions as to the nature of the Israeli Suit 2, the fact remained (and which I accept) that Israeli Suit 2 covered matters which <em>went beyond</em> Israeli Suit 1.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Husband had sought adjudication by, and relief from, the Israeli Family Court with regard to the parties’ post-marital assets (which was a new claim in Israeli Suit 2). Separate service of legal process was carried out in respect of Israeli Suit 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the Israeli Family Court appeared to have expressed a dim view of the Wife for her decision not to participate in Israeli Suit 2 when she had already participated in Israeli Suit 1, I nevertheless accept the Wife’s foreign law expert’s opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that she did not act in a manner which could be taken as having submitted to the Israeli Family Court’s jurisdiction <em>for Israeli Suit 2</em>. She did not participate in those proceedings, nor did she file any documents or take any steps in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To address this concern, the Husband mounted a <em>secondary</em> argument, <em>ie.</em> that this Court should deem the Wife as having submitted to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction of Israeli Suit 2 under the principle of “inchoate submission” referred to in the High Court’s decision of <em>Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0545.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 545</a> (“<em>Giant Light Metal</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I accept that the principle of inchoate submission has been recognised by the local courts as being part of Singapore law. The General Division of the High Court’s recent decision in <em>Re Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd and anor matter (GAS, non-party)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32165-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 241</a> at [81] confirmed its application in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     However, I am not persuaded that the principle of inchoate submission applies in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In <em>Giant Light Metal</em>, Andrew Ang J explained the principle as follows (at [48] and [49] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    Underlying all three of these cases is the principle that the courts are willing to recognise, for the purposes of international jurisdiction, that a party’s consent to the jurisdiction of a foreign court in relation to certain claims may be imputed to further claims in some circumstances. … Such “inchoate submission” – as seen in Whyte and Aeroflot – is also possible in relation to claims which are brought pursuant to subsequent and separate proceedings in respect of the same parties, rather than just to claims which are part of the same proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">49    The question then is when consent will be imputed or “inchoate submission” be said to arise. Murthy provided two factual reference points for consent to be so imputed: where the subsequent claim concerns the same subject matter; and where the subsequent claim is related to the original claim. Which subsequent claims will fall under these categories is then a matter of degree based on the circumstances. The courts in making this assessment seemed to be informed by concerns of fairness to both the plaintiff and the defendant, and also a desire to disregard technical impediments created by procedural rules under both foreign and forum law. With respect, I agree with such an approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For the reasons I had set out at [64] above, I find that Israeli Suit 1 and Suit 2 did not concern claims for the <em>same</em> subject-matter and/or that the claim in Suit 1 was <em>related</em> to Suit 2. The “same” or “related” subject-matter I am referring to is the claim for the division of the parties’ <em>post-marital</em> assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In my view, it would not be appropriate or fair to impute the Wife’s consent to, and participation in, Israeli Suit 1 (which related to the parties’ Partnership Agreement) as being her acceptance of the Israeli court’s jurisdiction <em>vis-à-vis</em> Israeli Suit 2 when a significant part of the latter Suit related to how the parties’ matrimonial assets are to be divided. The two Suits thus involved separate subject-matter and reliefs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     On a related issue, the Israeli court had, in its judgment for Israeli Suit 2, determined that there was proper service of legal process on the Wife in accordance with Israeli procedural rules, and that it was satisfied that the Wife was aware of the proceedings in Suit 2 when it proceeded to render its judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Notwithstanding the Israeli court’s decision, the Wife’s counsel submitted that in answering the question as to whether a party had submitted to a foreign jurisdiction, the Singapore court ought to determine the same by reference to <em>Singapore’s</em> conflict of laws principles.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In other words, even if a party is deemed to have been within the foreign court’s jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of foreign civil procedure, it does not necessarily mean that there has been voluntary submission under the Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I agree with the Wife’s submissions and for the reasons I have explained above, the Wife did not voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, despite the foreign court’s own decision that it had jurisdiction over her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In view of my conclusion that the Wife did not submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, I find that the Husband’s other argument relating to transnational issue estoppel (which he had raised in his written submissions) would not be engaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In <em>The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31082-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 56</a> (“<em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em>”), the Court of Appeal re-affirmed the formulation of the legal test for transnational issue estoppel observing (at [64] – [65]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    The same test has been applied with some modifications in the context of <em>transnational</em> issue estoppel where the prior judgment is rendered in a foreign jurisdiction (<em>Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp (formerly known as Merck &amp; Co, Inc) v Merck KGaA (formerly known as E Merck)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26043-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 1102</a> (“<em>Merck Sharp</em>”) (at [2]); <em>The Sennar</em> at 500). The test for transnational issue estoppel has been formulated as follows (<em>Merck Sharp</em> at [35]–[40]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The foreign judgment must be capable of being recognised in this jurisdiction, where issue estoppel is being invoked. Under the common law, this means that the foreign judgment must:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    be a final and conclusive decision on the merits;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   not be subject to any defences to recognition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    There must be commonality of the parties to the prior proceedings and to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    The subject matter of the estoppel must be the same as what has been decided in the prior judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65    With respect to the requirement at [64(a)(ii)] above that the <b>court giving the foreign judgment must have transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</b>, this requirement has been defined in terms that <b>the forum court recognising the judgment must be satisfied that, according to its own rules of private international law</b>, <b>the foreign court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction in the “international sense”</b> to render that judgment (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss Sea Transport</em>”) at [71]; <em>The Republic of the Philippines v Maler Foundation and others and other appeals</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1389.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1389</a> (“<em>Maler Foundation</em>”) at [66]). <b>There are four possible grounds of jurisdiction: (a) presence in the foreign country; (b) filing a claim or counterclaim before the foreign court; (c) voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court by appearing in the proceedings; and (d) agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction before the commencement of proceedings</b> (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport at [71]; Sang Cheol Woo v Spackman, Charles Choi and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29049-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 298</a> (“Sang Cheol Woo”) at [57]).</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In the present case, none of the four possible grounds of jurisdiction noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em> (see above) applied such that a judgment in Israeli Suit 2 would be one which “<em>originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</em>”. The Wife had no presence in Israel, did not file any formal claim or counterclaim in Israeli Suit 2, nor did she agree and/or voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that allowing D 249 to proceed would not create multiplicity of proceedings. Insofar as Israeli Suit 2 sought to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets, that decision was made in the Wife’s absence, and she is entitled to proceed with the AM Proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I do not find there to be a need for a permanent case management stay to be granted as a result of Israeli Suit 2. To avoid doubt, nothing in my decision precludes the Husband from raising the outcome of the Israeli Suit 2 to the Singapore court hearing the AM Proceedings, or for the Wife to apply to set-aside any judgment rendered in Israeli Suit 2 (if she so wishes).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     As regards Israeli Suit 1, the subject matter of that action pertains to the parties’ <em>pre­</em>-marital assets. It is trite that the spouses’ pre-marital assets are not matrimonial assets over which the Family Court has the power to divide under s 112(1) of the WC. That being the case, the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment may well be a matter which could be raised to the court hearing the AM Proceedings in Singapore, but it was not a decision which would result in a multiplicity of proceedings, or might give rise to inconsistent judgments if the AM Proceedings continue in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevance of the Israeli Barring Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Before I leave the issue of the Israeli Proceedings, I want to briefly address an order issued by the Israeli Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On 10 February 2024, the Israeli Family Court issued what the parties referred to as a “Barring Order”. In effect, this Barring Order was akin to an anti-suit injunction prohibiting the Wife from conducting “<em>property proceedings</em>” in a jurisdiction other than in the Israeli court. Both parties accept that the Barring Order would cover D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     At the conclusion of the first tranche of the hearing of SUM 930, I directed both parties’ counsel to file further written submissions on the relevance and impact of the Barring Order <em>vis-à-vis</em> SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It was common ground in both counsel’s written submissions that while the existence of the Barring Order was something which this Court can consider in the overall analysis of the case, this Court was not bound to follow the Barring Order, save that it may give rise to a consideration of international comity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     In my view, any concerns as regards international comity in the present case may well be academic given that the Husband (in favour of whom the Barring Order was made) had taken the position – through counsel – that the proceedings in Israel were effectively over. Counsel explained that that Israeli Suit 2 had since completed with the Israeli Family Court issuing an order for the payment of monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In other words, there is now an alleged judgment debt due from the Wife arising from the Israeli court’s final determination of the “property dispute” in relation to Israeli Suit 2. How the Husband seeks to enforce that judgment against the Wife would be a separate matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Insofar as D 249 is concerned, the question before this Court is simply whether it should continue now that the Israeli Family Court had issued its decisions. In my view, this is not a matter which would impinge on, or overlap with, the Barring Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In any case, whether the Wife is liable for breaching the Barring Order (if at all) would be a matter to be addressed in the Israeli courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s appeal against the Judgment in Israeli Suit 1</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     I move on to the next (and final) issue, <em>ie.</em> what, if any, would be the impact of the Israeli Appeal filed by the Husband’ against the Judge Yosef’s decision for Israeli Suit 1?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In my judgment, the Husband’s appeal is particularly relevant given that it was the Husband’s case, in Israeli Suit 1, that the Partnership Agreement between the parties operated as a pre-nuptial agreement (“PNA”). In the Husband’s Statement of Appeal to the Israel District Court, he requested the appellate court to intervene and hold that the Partnership Agreement also applied to property accumulated after marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This meant that if the Israeli appellate court eventually decides that the Partnership Agreement (and its 80:20 division ratio in favour of the Husband) also applied to post-marital assets, such an outcome may potentially have an impact on the Singapore AM Proceedings. This is because the enforceability of a foreign PNA entered into by the parties before marriage may be a relevant fact which the AM court in Singapore may take into account when it determines what would be a just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets: see for <em>eg. TQ v TR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0961.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Put another way, the present case would be akin to a case where, in proceedings for ancillary reliefs before the Singapore court, one of the parties wishes to rely on the terms of a PNA governed by foreign law while the other party challenges the PNA’s validity. Where there are parallel proceedings in the foreign court to determine the validity and/or enforceability of the said PNA under the laws applicable to the contract, it is not uncommon for the Singapore court to temporarily stay the local proceedings to await the decision of the foreign court in order to assess whether the foreign court’s decision might impact how the assets are to be divided in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Both counsel have confirmed, via correspondence to the Court in October 2024, that the Husband’s Israeli Appeal remains pending. Given that the outcome of the appeal may have an impact on what the court hearing the AM Proceedings has to consider, I find it fair and reasonable to grant a limited case management stay of D 249 until the conclusion of the Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Over the course of various series of twists and turns in the progress of the Israeli Proceedings, the Husband’s position with respect to the present divorce proceedings have similarly meandered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     SUM 930 which was filed as an application for a stay of the entirety of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> turned into to a partial stay of the AM reliefs <em>pending</em> the conclusion the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s application to amend SUM 930), and finally to a request for a permanent stay because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s counsel’s submissions at the hearing of SUM 930).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     In the end, I ordered that there be a limited case management stay in respect of D 249 pending the conclusion of the Husband’s Israeli Appeal. This order was, in effect, similar to what the Husband had sought in his Prayer 1 of the amended FC/SUM 930/2023, <em>ie.</em> that the proceedings in FC/D 249/2023 are stayed pending the final decision of the Courts of Israel (Family court, District court, etc.) in relation to suit no. 60180-XX-XX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     However, given that the Husband was no longer seeking a temporary stay of proceedings and the entirety of the hearing of SUM 930 was focused on whether he was entitled to a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249 (which I did not agree with), I found that the Wife was, in the overall analysis, the successful party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     When I delivered my oral decision on 21 October 2024, I asked both counsel to address me on the issue of costs which the Wife would be entitled to as costs should follow the event.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel sought costs in the sum of $8,000, excluding disbursements. The latter would include the costs of the Wife’s foreign law expert, and her counsel had proposed that a separate determination be made for the quantum of such disbursements if parties were unable to reach an agreement. The Husband’s counsel disagreed with the Wife’s claim, including whether the Wife was entitled to claim disbursements and costs relating to her foreign law expert.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    Given the parties’ disagreement, I directed both parties to file further submissions on the matter, which both counsel duly did so. Having considered the same, I find that the Wife’s claim for the costs of her foreign law expert in the sum of $36,624.78 to be very high. Given the nature and complexity of the issued which the Court had to consider, the contents of the expert’s report, and the lack of any breakdown or itemization, I am unable to agree with this figure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I therefore ordered costs be paid by the Husband to the Wife in the sum of $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements).</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>By Order made in FC/SUM 561/2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff-Wife’s Submissions dd 13.05.24 (“WS1”) at [47]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amnd No. 1) re-dated 18.09.23;

After a contested divorce, the issue of the division of assets came before me for hearing. I ordered for each party to keep their respective assets and for the Husband to pay cost fixed at $2,500 for the ancillary matters hearing. The Wife appealed against the entire order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties married on 15 December 2018 in Singapore and the Interim Judgment dissolving the marriage was granted on 2 October 2023. During the course of the marriage, both parties did not work. The Wife was about 32 years of age at the time of the hearing and the Husband was about 55 years of age. The Wife is a Chinese National residing in China whilst the Husband is a Singapore Citizen residing in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Prior to the marriage, the Husband transferred sums of money to the Wife and her parents. After the marriage, as the Husband had surrendered his passport to the authorities, parties lived together in the Husband’s HDB flat whenever the Wife was in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime around 18 May 2021, the Wife discovered the Husband had acted improperly with another lady. The Husband was then incarcerated a few days later (around 20 May 2021). They had little to no contact until the Wife served the divorce papers on the Husband in 2022. In the ancillary proceedings, the Husband sought the return of the monies from the Wife and the Wife claimed a share of the Husband’s HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband’s claim is based on the monies:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     he/his brother had transferred to his Wife and her parents between 1 February 2015 to 19 May 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     withdrawn from his China account between 20 September 2015 and 31 January 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Totalling: CNY2,744,794.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       He claimed there was an agreement/understanding between the parties that the above sums were for investment purposes and he sought a recovery of 50% of the amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife resisted the Husband’s claim on the basis that the monies were gifts to her and disputed the existence of any agreement. In any event, the Wife submitted that the Husband’s claim is a civil claim and cannot be claimed as a division of matrimonial assets pursuant to a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife claimed a 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat on the basis of her indirect contributions during the marriage. The Husband resisted this claim on the basis that the HDB flat was acquired by him prior to the marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s claim for 50% of the monies with the Wife </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband clarified at the first ancillary hearing on 23 April 2024 that he sought the Wife’s repayment of 50% of the sum referred to in paragraph 5. He claimed that the monies were for investment and the Wife had purchased a property in China (which was meant to be their matrimonial home) as well as banking products from such monies. He claimed 50% repayment of the principal invested amount and claimed this was fair since he is sharing this equally with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Transactions set out in tables 7.1 and 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife conceded that the transfers set out were received/taken save for Table 7.1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SN 16: a transfer of CNY500,000 to the Wife’s mother on 20 July 2018</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SN 15: cash savings of S$60,000 withdrawn from the Wife’s UOB account on 19 May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For SN 16, the Husband’s evidence was on page 78 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit. However, page 78 contains what appears to be a screenshot of a mobile message in Mandarin save for 2 names, which did not appear to belong to the parties. The message was not translated and the Husband was clearly aware of the requirement for evidence to be translated as he was reminded of this by me during the contested divorce trial wherein some of his evidence was expunged for the lack of translation. The alleged transfer in SN 16 is therefore unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For SN 15, the Husband referred to pages 51 and 52 of his Affidavit of Assets and Means. The 2 pages contain translated messages between the Husband and Wife around 28 October 2018. Firstly, the message occurred years before the alleged timing of the transaction in SN 15 and secondly, the messages only reflected the Wife’s initial impression that she could not withdraw monies from a Singapore bank account in China. There is no supporting evidence to prove that during the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s UOB bank account contained S$60,000 which belonged to him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such amount was withdrawn by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Therefore, SN 15 is also unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the remaining amounts which the Wife admitted to, she explained they were monies given to her by the Husband, her boyfriend at that time, for financial support and as gifts. They had an ongoing relationship where she was fully supported by him financially and these monies were just given to her or instructed by him to be withdrawn by her for her own use. There were no instructions from the Husband about investments and she was free to deal with the funds as she wished as they were gifted to her. She explained she used the funds for her living expenses as well as her parents’ living expenses and also did some investments (in which she suffered losses). In any event, she submitted that these monies do not form any matrimonial asset since all transactions occurred prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Applicable law on the division of matrimonial assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Family Court has the power to divide matrimonial assets upon a divorce. The definition of matrimonial assets is defined in section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. The case of <em>USB v USA and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24645-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 57</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>USB v USA</em>”) is instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“18    Examining the above provision, it is clear that the intention of the legislature was to confine the court’s powers of division to <em>assets relating to marriage</em>. It is established law that in determining the legislative purpose of a provision, primacy must be accorded to both the text and statutory context of the legislation: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [43]. As a starting point, the title of s 112 of the Charter states that the provision deals with the “[p]ower of court to order division of matrimonial assets”, <em>ie</em>, assets relating to marriage. Further, s 112 falls under Pt X of the Charter which, on the whole, pertains to matters relating to the dissolution of <em>marriage</em>. In the Charter, Parliament made the decision to confine the court’s power to divide assets belonging to divorcing parties to those they acquired during marriage. This was a matter of social policy, and one clearly within Parliament’s purview. The court cannot and should not wade into matters of social policy where the legislature has established a clear statutory framework providing for the division of assets relating to <em>marriage</em>. <b><em>It is, thus, axiomatic that the court must disregard assets which were acquired during pre-marital cohabitation or during any non-marital relationship. The ownership of such assets would have to be determined in accordance with general property law principles.</em></b> It should further be emphasised that in determining the length of a marriage, the court ought not to take into account the period during which parties were cohabiting. Marriage confers a legal status on the parties which carries with it specified rights and obligations. For non-Muslim couples who marry in Singapore, their marriage begins when they satisfy the various statutory prescriptions which the Charter sets out for the attainment of that status. The Charter governs all aspects of civil marriage and divorce in Singapore. Thus, under our law, it is inherently self-contradictory to treat parties as “married” when they were simply cohabiting.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband’s claim is not on any of the Wife’s existing assets/investments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although he made reference to the existence of them, which shows she has hidden assets that can meet his claim<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and/or corroborates his case that there was an agreement/understanding to invest. Majority of his claim is based on transactions that occurred prior to the marriage. The exceptions are SN 15 (which is unproven) and SN 10. For SN 10, there were 3 transfers from the Husband’s brother (allegedly to return a loan to the Husband) totalling CNY 80,000.00 (S$16,000) into the Wife’s account in 2019. The Husband’s consistent case throughout the hearing was to recover investment monies based on an alleged agreement formed prior to the marriage between parties. This is not a claim that can be made pursuant to the Court’s ancillary powers in divorce proceedings. Notwithstanding the Husband’s claim that they were already planning to marry then and he treated her as his wife, it is the conferment of the legal status through a valid marriage that satisfies the relevant statutory requirements that parties can avail themselves of the marital rights and obligations set out in the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made no order, based on the Husband’s claim although he is at liberty to take up other appropriate actions for the relief he sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s claim for 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It is undisputed that the HDB flat in question is solely owned by the Husband and was fully acquired by him prior to the marriage. The Wife sought a 30% share of the HDB flat based on her indirect contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In paragraphs 15-18 of her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she confirmed she made no direct financial contributions towards the flat and listed her indirect non-financial contributions during the marriage, which I summarise to be broadly to be,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when she stayed with the Husband in Singapore for short periods of 1 to 2 months at a time between December 2018 to 2019 and then for one year period between 2020 to 2021, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     when in China, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband via WeChat calls and messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she did not initially make any claim on the Husband’s HDB flat. The claim was first made in the Wife’s second Ancillary Affidavit. There was no further evidence detailing the Wife’s contributions. Little ink was spilled in the Wife’s written submissions on this claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I first considered whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset as it was clearly acquired before the marriage. Section 112(10) provides for the inclusion of assets acquired prior to the marriage as matrimonial assets if transformed. Again, the case of <em>USB v USA</em> at paragraph 19 offers guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but which have been substantially improved during the marriage by the other spouse or by both spouses, or which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the whole asset goes into the pool but if there is no transformation then, subject to (c) below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with general principles of property law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Parties did live in the HDB flat, as their home whenever the Wife was in Singapore notwithstanding the short marriage. In the case of <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a>, ordinary use and enjoyment cannot be occasional or casual:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18    I found that the Bayshore property was ordinarily used by both parties for shelter and, therefore, a matrimonial asset. The requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the parties’ use of or stay at the property was “occasional or casual”: <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [23]. Examples of casual residence are staying in a property for no more than 21 days out of 14 years of marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [60]) or on only two occasions throughout the marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19032-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 717</a> at [15]). On the present facts, even if I had accepted the Husband’s submission, residence in the property for 15 months is sufficient to constitute ordinary use for shelter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In the current case, parties lived together in the HDB flat during the marriage for about 23 months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> based on the Wife’s own evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. This was the only residence they lived together during their marriage as the Husband could not travel. There were multiple earlier attempts by the Husband to try to obtain longer residential passes for the Wife in Singapore, which supported the probability parties intended to make Singapore their home base. There were no indications that the HDB flat was meant to be a casual or temporary residence pending further plans to move to a more permanent home. I therefore made a finding that the HDB flat is a transformed matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of a solely acquired matrimonial asset in a short childless marriage</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In the case of <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>TNK v TNK</em>”), the Court of Appeal clarified that the approach set out in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) will not apply to single income marriages. The Court of Appeal confirmed the approach for long single-income marriages albeit leaving the considerations for short Single-Income marriages open:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    In <em>long</em> Single-Income Marriages, the precedent cases show that our courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets. We are in general agreement with this approach. We pause to highlight that different considerations may attach in <em>short</em> Single-Income Marriages, although we propose to leave that issue to be dealt with in an appropriate case in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In the current case, neither party worked during the marriage. However, the Husband was clearly the sole financial provider during the marriage. I am of the view that the same principle why <em>ANJ v ANK</em> methodology should not be used for single-income marriages would similarly apply in this case to unduly favour the Husband as explained in <em>TNL v TNK</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">44    Our reconsideration of the <em>ANJ</em> approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that <em>ANJ</em> approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under <em>both</em> Steps 1 and 2 of the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Whilst for long single-income marriages, division tends towards equal division, this cannot be similarly applied to short marriages. Although decided before <em>ANJ v ANK</em> and <em>TNL v TNK</em>, the Court of Appeal held in <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/53472-M.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR 729</a> non-financial contributions in a short childless marriage will be minimal:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28    Having excluded Malvern Springs from division, we now turn to consider the division of the matrimonial home. <em>In a short and childless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions as non-financial contributions will be minimal.</em> Thus, in <em>Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Cheung Kevin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 2 SLR(R) 0172.xml')\">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 172</a>, a case where the wife left home after a year, the High Court divided the matrimonial home solely in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions. In the present case, it has been established that the direct financial contributions of the parties to the matrimonial home are in the proportions of 64:36 from the Husband and the Wife respectively. The Wife rightly did not make a claim for any non-financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the current case, I find the non-financial contributions claimed by the Wife to be minimal in view of the short marriage, especially bearing in mind the Husband’s incarceration and lack of contact since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I therefore awarded the Wife no share in the HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Neither party succeeded in their claim in the ancillary matters hearing. However, I awarded costs of $2,500 in the Wife’s favour given that hearing time was almost entirely spent on the Husband’s claim. I also took into account the fact that the Wife took up a belated application to file a further affidavit after the matter was fixed for ancillary hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.1, the first set of SN 1 to 17 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband orally submitted on 10 July 2024 that he does not plan to claim investment returns but only to get back his investment principal.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s oral submission on 16 July 2024 that paragraphs 10.2 to 10.4 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit is to prove the Wife’s accounts have money which she has hidden but his claim is 50% of what was transferred to her.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of Wife’s 3<sup>rd</sup> AM Hearing Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>There was an error in the timeframe in my brief reasons but nothing turns on this error.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 17 of the Wife’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Ancillary powers of court – Parties seeking to vary order on division of matrimonial home – How power to vary is to be exercised – Section 112(4) Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2024-12-23","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4937 of 2021, Summons No. 3012 of 2024;

They have a son together (D.O.B.: May 2013). In August 2023, orders on ancillary matters (“<b>Order</b>”) were made following the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Clause 3 of the Order deals with the matrimonial home. It states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The matrimonial property at XXX shall be divided in the proportion of 54% to the Plaintiff and 46% to the Defendant, based on joint valuation in the event of a transfer. <em>In the event of a transfer</em>, the transferee will bear the costs and expenses of the transfer. <em>In the event of a sale</em>, parties will bear the costs and expenses of sale equally. Parties are to refund their CPF monies utilised towards the purchase of the matrimonial property with accrued interest from their own share of the matrimonial property. <em>Parties will work out the payment terms within 4 weeks. Failing which, parties are to apply for further orders</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is common ground that based on Clause 3, the Plaintiff is to receive <b>$475,200</b> as his share in the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ positions and interests</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties are however unable to agree on how the Plaintiff is to receive the relevant funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff wants to receive the funds by <em>selling</em> the home in the open market. According to him, he needs his share of the sale proceeds to move on with his life and to purchase his own place.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, the Defendant wants to <em>take over</em> the matrimonial home – to ensure continuity in the son’s current living arrangements. In the Defendant’s view, such a continuity is important because the son is sitting for his PSLE in 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Proposed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given their disagreement on how the matrimonial home ought to be dealt with, the parties applied to vary the Order. The details of their proposed variations are in <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. In summary –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff proposes that Clause 3 be varied such that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The matrimonial home is to be sold in the open market within six months,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Both parties are to have joint conduct of the sale, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Each party is to retain the balance of the sale proceeds in the ratio of 54% (Plaintiff) and 46% (Defendant) after the relevant payments and refunds have been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Defendant proposes that Clause 3 and Clause 2 (on child maintenance) be varied such that she takes over the matrimonial home after making the following payments (totalling $475,200) to the Plaintiff:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $220,000 (cash) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $153,900 (from lump sum child maintenance payable by the Plaintiff)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $101,300 (transfer from the Defendant’s CPF Special Account to the Plaintiff’s CPF Special Account).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before I address the proposed variations, it is useful to first summarise the applicable principles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">When is power available</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets is provided in s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). This power is available only if the order has <em>not</em> been completely implemented. Put in another way, if everything that is required to be done under the order has been carried out and the assets concerned has already been distributed, then the court will not have the power under s 112(4) to revisit or reopen the order: <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<b><em>AYM</em></b>”) at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the present case, it is not disputed that the power to vary the Clause 3 is available as the provision has not been implemented yet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether power should be exercised </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The next question is whether I ought to vary Clause 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the need for finality, courts will exercise the power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets only in limited situations: <em>AYM</em> at [22]. Two well established situations where courts will exercise the power are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where the order is <em>unworkable to begin with</em>. This unworkability can be due to (i) a lack of functionality of the order, or (ii) a fundamental misunderstanding at the time the order was made: <em>AYM</em> at [29].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the order has <em>become unworkable</em> because of <em>new circumstances</em> which either (i) make the order impossible to implement practically, or (ii) so radically changes the situation so that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended: <em>AYM</em> at [25] to [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I should add that the Court of Appeal has left open the issue of whether an application under s 112(4) will also be entertained in the following situations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where there has been fraud in an order for the division of matrimonial assets: <em>AYM</em> at [30].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the division is made by a consent order and there has been an absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties: <em>AYM</em> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where there has been fraudulent misrepresentation made by one of the parties before the divorce: <em>AYM</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, the present case falls within [10(b)] above. I say this because Clause 3 <em>could have been implemented</em> if the parties are able to agree on how the matrimonial home is to be dealt with. However, as it turns out, such an agreement is not possible. (Clause 3 did not provide for this contingency – e.g., by directing that the matrimonial home be sold in the open market if the parties fail to reach an agreement on its transfer to the Defendant after a specified period.) As a result of the disagreement, Clause 3 is impossible to implement. In the circumstances, I agree with the parties that I ought to vary Clause 3 to resolve the parties’ impasse regarding the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">How should power be exercised</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     This brings me to the next issue – how should Clause 3 be varied? In this case, the parties have presented me with competing proposals for variation. How should I decide?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In the context of the present case (which involves a variation under [10(b)] above), I find the following considerations to be relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Starting point</em>. It is well settled that when a court exercises its power under s 122(4), it will not re-open the original order. Neither will the court allow the parties to re-litigate the order: <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a> (“<b><em>UMM</em></b>”) at [15]. The starting point is that the original order is just and equitable, and that the variation must be done in a way that preserves its integrity and finality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In line with the above, a court needs to consider the following when varying an order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>Whether the variation is surgical</em>. The variation should be surgical – i.e., (1) it should be done with a light touch, and (2) it should be limited to do only what is necessary to make the original order workable: <em>TYA v TYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21710-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 1170</a> at [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Whether the variation reflects intent of original order</em>. It is necessary to consider (1) what is the intent behind the original order (<em>AYM</em> at [25]) and (2) whether the variation is consistent with this intent. The variation should not have the effect of altering the purpose and effect of the original order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Whether the variation preserves parties’ rights and obligations</em>. The variation should also avoid prejudice to the parties – whether in (1) diminishing/removing their rights under the original order, (2) imposing new obligation(s), or (3) making existing obligation(s) more onerous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Whether the variation achieves the best outcome</em>. When presented with more than one option to vary an order, a court should logically choose the option that has the most upsides and the least downsides. The variation should ultimately achieve a just or equitable outcome: <em>Seet Poh v Lim Lee Cheng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 3 SLR 0208.xml')\">[2014] 3 SLR 208</a> at [35]. To be clear, this does not mean that a court has the license to re-write the original order on how the matrimonial assets are to be divided: see [14(a)] above. Rather, the aim is simply to avoid a situation where the variation (inadvertently) results in unfairness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Having set out the applicable principles, I will not apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Agreed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As a preliminary point – I note that the Defendant consents to some of the variations proposed by the Plaintiff. These are in the white boxes at <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. In my view, these variations (a) are in line with the intent of Clause 3, (b) do not impinge on the finality of the Order, and (c) are reasonable. Accordingly, I allow these variations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Disputed variations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I now turn to the proposed variations that are disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Between the two, I prefer the Plaintiff’s proposed variations over the Defendant’s proposed variations. This is because I find that the Plaintiff’s proposed variations (a) are surgical, (b) better reflects the Order’s original intent, (c) better preserves the parties’ rights and obligations under the Order, and (d) achieves a better outcome. For my detailed reasons, see <b><u>Annex B</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     At this stage, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff “bears the burden of proof if he wishes to vary the order to that of a sale order instead of a transfer order”. According to her, this is because “the original order provided for a transfer as there was reference to payment terms”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This submission is plainly unmeritorious. <em>First</em>, Clause 3 contemplates the possibility of both a <em>sale</em> and a transfer of the home – and not just a transfer. <em>Second</em>, given that the Defendant is seeking to transfer the home to herself, she must prove why this is appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This conveniently leads me to my next point. A central theme of the Defendant’s submission is that a sale of the matrimonial home will disrupt the son’s living arrangements and PSLE preparations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In my view, the impact of the potential disruption is overstated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, I find that the potential impact to the son’s PSLE preparations from the sale of the matrimonial home is likely to be minor. I have explained why in <b><u>Annex B</u></b> at (4)(A)(ii).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, it bears highlighting that the potential disruption to the son can in fact be minimised <em>by the Defendant herself</em> – by selling her Parc Riviera property. The Defendant however is not prepared to do so because she did not want to incur “hefty financial costs” from its sale.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Defendant should get her priorities clear – if she is really concerned for her son’s welfare, then she should make the necessary financial sacrifice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, the Defendant’s proposed variations entail her obtaining a $220,000 bank loan and maintaining the son solely on her own salary. There is a risk that she might end up becoming financially stretched as a result, be unable to adequately provide maintenance for the son, and thus jeopardise his welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I come to my last point. The Defendant’s proposal requires Clause 2 (on child maintenance) to be varied. In my view, the Defendant’s underlying motives for the variation is unprincipled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, to vary an order on child maintenance, the Defendant must prove that there has been a “material change in the circumstances” of either the son or his parents: s 72 and s 127(2) of the Charter; <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> at [16]; <em>UGK v UGL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20919-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 121</a> at [15]. According to the Defendant, this requirement is met because –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">if the Father’s application is allowed, there will be such a material change in circumstances as the child will be forced to seek alternative accommodation (and there will be a different set of expenses such as rental etc). In the circumstances, we submit that the Mother has crossed the threshold given that the Father was the party who has filed for such orders.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>I find the Defendant’s submission to be disingenuous. Based on her own case, the variation is to <em>prevent</em> a change in the son’s living arrangement (so that the child can continue to stay in the matrimonial home) – and <em>not in response</em> to such a change (e.g., to cover rental costs).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, one of the Defendant’s motives for the variation is to finance <em>her</em> takeover of the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> – and not because, e.g., there has been an increase in the <em>son’s</em> monthly expenses. The Defendant clearly has no intention of using the lump sum maintenance that she is seeking to pay <em>for the son’s daily living expenses</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, the Defendant’s other motive for seeking a lump sum maintenance is to facilitate a clean break between the Plaintiff and the son. This is contrary to the well settled legal position that such a clean break (between a parent and a child) is rarely desirable and courts are slow to order a lump sum maintenance for this reason: <em>VSL v VSM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 33</a> at [30]. The Defendant has failed to provide any compelling reason why it is necessary, and in the son’s interest, for him to have a clean break from the Plaintiff. For clarity, I wish to state that the mere fact that the Plaintiff had allegedly failed to exercise his access rights or take care of the son during his access periods<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> is not a good reason for a clean break.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Finally</em>, there is nothing to stop the Defendant from seeking further child maintenance from the Plaintiff in future – given that the latter has a continuing duty to maintain his child: s 68, s 69(2) and s 73 of the Charter; <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> at [16]. Such a prospect is very likely given that the son is only 11 years old, and his expenses will certainly increase in the coming years. When the son’s financial needs increases beyond her means, there is nothing to compel the Defendant to sell the Parc Riveira property – despite her assurances to do so (as these are non-legally binding).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the above, my decision is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the Plaintiff’s application in Summons No. 3012 of 2024 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Prayers 1(a) to 1(c) are granted. For the avoidance of doubt, I accept the Defendant’s submissions and find that the “outstanding loan” referred to in Prayer 1(b) should be determined as <em>at the date of the Order</em>, and <em>not</em> the date of the transfer of the Parc Riviera property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Prayer 2 is dismissed – I agree with the Defendant that a penal notice is unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Prayer 4 is granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I dismiss the Defendant’s application in Summons No. 3316 of 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Before concluding, I wish to highlight one learning point from this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the AM proceedings, the Plaintiff had left it to the district judge to make a just and equitable division of the matrimonial home,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> while the Defendant had wanted the Plaintiff to transfer his interests in the home to her for no consideration.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Clause 3 is open-ended – the parties are left to decide whether the matrimonial home should be sold on the open market or transferred to one of them. It does not address the situation where the parties <em>cannot</em> agree on how the home should be dealt with – which is exactly what had occurred in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The failure to address the above situation could have been avoided. After all, the ancillary matters were hotly contested, and it is foreseeable that the parties will not agree on whether the matrimonial home should be sold or transferred. Even if it was felt appropriate for the Defendant to be given the first option to purchase the Plaintiff’s share in the home, there should have been a deadline imposed for the exercise of such an option. For an example of this, see clauses 1 and 2 of the consent order in <em>VPB v VPC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 15</a> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In my view, (a) the delay in dealing with the matrimonial home, (b) the applications before me, and (c) the financial and emotional costs in litigating the applications, could have been avoided <em>if all parties concerned</em> had carefully thought through the issues and had taken a clearer and firmer position on how the matrimonial home is to be dealt with. This is of course said with the benefit of hindsight. It would do well for parties and counsel to take note of the learning point raised in these applications in future cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given my views in [21] and [22] above, the Defendant is not solely responsible for the events that had led to the applications before me. Contrary to the Plaintiff submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the evidence does not prove unequivocally that the Defendant had conducted the proceedings in an unreasonable manner. In the circumstances, it inappropriate to order costs against her.

Under the Plaintiff’s proposal, the matrimonial home is to be sold within six months (i.e., by June 2025). PSLE starts only sometime thereafter.

According to the Defendant, ordering a sale of the home at this juncture will disrupt his studies and undermine the principles of therapeutic justice.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>Proposal’s downsides –</em></b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The proposed variations–</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Will result in the Plaintiff not receiving a portion of the cash that he can receive from the sale of the home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) Will result in the Plaintiff being unable to use $122,428.12 (which the Defendant plans to pay him) for a few years.

In the alternative, the Father sought joint custody, with care and control to the Defendant (“the Mother”) and liberal access, including overnight access, to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother disagreed with the Father’s application. She sought for joint custody, with sole care and control to herself and supervised access to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       There were also prayers for maintenance of the child which were heard subsequently. For avoidance of doubt, as the maintenance orders are not the subject matter of the appeal, I will not be addressing the issue of maintenance in this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Prior to the hearing of the main application, I had ordered, with the consent of parties, for a custody evaluation report to be done.

They were also ordered to attend counselling at the DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After hearing parties and considering the child evaluation report and reports from the DSSA, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties shall have joint custody of C, with care and control to the Mother and liberal access to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Weekly Access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With effect from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2024 till 12<sup>th</sup> June 2025 (inclusive), the Father shall have access to C as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i-p4_A\"></a>(A)       Every Wednesday from 4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i-p4_B\"></a>(B)       Every Friday from 4.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i-p4_C\"></a>(C)       Every Saturday from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       With effect on or after 13<sup>th</sup> June 2025 (upon the child turning 5 years of age), the Father shall have access to C as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii-p4_A\"></a>(A)       Every Wednesday from 4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii-p4_B\"></a>(B)       Every Friday from 4.30 p.m. to Sunday 9.30 a.m. (with overnight stay)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <u>Chinese New Year Access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With effect from the year 2025, the Father shall have access to C as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c-p3_i-p4_A\"></a>(A)       on odd years, on the eve of Chinese New Year Eve from 12.00 pm to 8.30 p.m. and on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c-p3_i-p4_B\"></a>(B)       on even years, on Chinese New Year Eve from 12.00 pm to 8.30 p.m. and on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Regardless of odd or even years, if there is a public holiday on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of Chinese New Year, the Father shall have access to C from 3.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <u>Christmas Day and 1<sup>st</sup> January</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With effect from 2024, the Father shall have access to C on even years, on Christmas day from 9.30 a.m. to 9.00 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       With effect from 2026, the Father shall have access to C on even years, on 1<sup>st</sup> January from 9.30 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <u>Public Holidays (excluding Chinese New Year, Christmas and 1<sup>st</sup> January)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With effect from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2024 till 12<sup>th</sup> June 2025 (inclusive), the Father shall have access to the C on the following public holidays from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e-p3_i-p4_A\"></a>(A)       National Day;</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e-p3_i-p4_B\"></a>(B)       Good Friday;</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e-p3_i-p4_C\"></a>(C)       Deepavali;

It is worth noting, however, that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father overseas and overnight access to C during the gazetted school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Parties met sometime in February 2016 and were married two years later in Singapore on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2018. They have only one child to the marriage, C born on xx June 2020. At the time of the hearings, C had just turned 4 years of age. After marriage, parties lived together with the Father’s parents and sister at the Father’s family home (“the family home”). It is not disputed that the Father comes from a traditional, Chinese patriarchal family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Sometime in 2016, parties sought the approval of the Father’s father (“the Grandfather”) to marry prior to the demise of the Mother’s mother, who was terminally ill. Their request was rejected by the Grandfather. According to the Mother, the Grandfather was often critical of the Mother, her family and their finances. To exacerbate matters, the Mother and the Father’s family had differing family values and practices, especially in relation to the upbringing of C, which resulted in increased tension within the family home. The Father inevitably found himself caught between both sides of the family overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 6 April 2021, a dispute arose between the Mother and the Grandfather during dinner, when the Grandfather told the Mother to shave C’s hair. C was about 9 months old at the time. According to the Father, prior to the incident, the Grandfather had on numerous occasions advised parties to shave C’s hair, in keeping with Chinese tradition, but the advice went unheeded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     When the Mother refused, an argument broke out at the dining table and the Grandfather threw a spoon on the table in the direction of the Mother. The Grandfather also threatened to cut C’s hair himself if the Mother did not do so. Following the incident, as she was afraid that the Grandfather would carry through with his threat, the Mother urged the Father to move out of the family home. They eventually moved out a few days later to stay with the Mother’s father at his flat, together with C. However, about two weeks after moving into the flat, the Father returned to his family home to live. According to the Father, the Mother’s father had express unhappiness with the Father for failing to provide for the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the Father returned to his family home to live, it is not disputed that he continued to visit the Mother and C on a daily basis, from about 8.00 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. to help take care of C and perform his duties before C fell asleep. He would bring with him necessities, groceries and food for the Mother and C. On Saturdays, parties would bring C over to the family home to visit the Father’s family and on Sundays, the Father would go over to spend time with C in the morning until her naptime after lunch. During her naptime, he would return home until the Mother called to inform him that C was awake. Parties would then bring C out together to visit attractions, playgrounds, parks or the library until after dinner. This arrangement lasted until 7 January 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 7 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 7 January 2022, during the Father’s visit, the Mother found the Father locked in the common toilet together with C at the flat. The Mother knocked on the toilet door repeatedly until the Father opened the door. To her horror, the Mother saw that C’s fringe had been snipped by the Father who was holding onto a pair of kitchen scissors. According to the Father, prior to 7 January 2022, the Father had noticed that the C’s fringe was getting longer to the point of irritating her eyes. He advised the Mother to trim C’s fringe, but nothing was done. As such, he decided to give C a quick trim. Shaken by the incident, the Mother called her father for assistance and the Father was asked to leave the flat by the latter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 11 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After the incident, there was no communication between parties until 11 January 2022. As the Father had not seen C since the incident, he requested to visit the child around 7.30 p.m. and was informed by the Mother to visit the child after 8.30 p.m. Unknown to the Mother, the Father’s family accompanied him on this particular visit as the Father had decided on separating from or divorcing the mother, and they wanted to discuss with the Mother and her father care and access issues relating to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     During the discussion, the Grandfather proposed for each party to have the child live with them for 3.5 days a week. It is not disputed that this discussion took place largely between the Grandfather and the Mother’s father for about an hour, with little or no input from the parties themselves during the discussion. When asked whether she agreed to the proposed arrangement, the Mother refused. Dissatisfied with the Mother’s response, the Grandfather told the Mother that he would call the police (which he promptly did) since the Father is entitled to 50% of the week with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On 14 January 2022, the Father sent messages to the Mother requesting to bring the child out to the parks and the zoo alone. The Mother replied stating that she was not agreeable to the Father taking C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 16 January 2022, the Mother sent a message asking the Father to see a counsellor together with her. She also informed the Father that he could visit the child as usual at her father's flat but he could not bring C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On 17 January 2022, while at work, the Father learnt from his parents that the Mother had applied for a personal protection order against the Father, his parents and his sister and they had just been served with the Summons for the application. This led to the Father doubting the Mother’s intentions to co-parent C equally with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Propelled by the above incidents, the Father filed the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applications for Personal Protection Orders (“PPOs”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother instituted applications for PPOs for herself and for C against the Father and the Father’s family, the details of which is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS x2/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s sister on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS x3/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s mother (“the Grandmother”) on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS x4/2022 filed by the Mother against the Grandfather on 14 January 2022. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 20 April 2023. There was no appeal against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     SS x5/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 8 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Visitation and Counselling at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     After the commencement of this Originating Summons, at a case conference on 16 February 2022, parties agreed for the Father to have supervised access to C at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency (“DSSA”) for 2 hours weekly. This was without prejudice to parties’ position taken in the main application. Parties were also referred for mediation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The supervised visitation sessions carried on for about 8 sessions between March to May 2022 (“1<sup>st</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending (i) that parties attend co-parenting counselling and (ii) subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents and the Father, counselling for the paternal grandparents to negotiate and manage their boundaries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     From the court’s perspective, given the disruptive nature of the relationship between parties and the extended family at the time, the recommendations were aimed at equipping parties and the paternal grandparents with the necessary tools required to support and enable parties to co-parent effectively for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As parties were unable to reach an agreement at mediation, at the case conferences on 30 May 2022 and 16 November 2022, parties agreed for supervised access to continue at the DSSA. The aim was to facilitate the Father’s continued access to C, pending the outcome of the Mother’s PPO application against the Father. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between August to December 2022 (“2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a further 8 sessions between January to June 2023 (“3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I also ordered parties to attend counselling to work on their co-parenting skills and, subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents, for the paternal grandparents to attend counselling, as recommended in the report. In view of the nature of the relationship between the Father and the paternal grandparents, and how the Father would often defer to the opinion of the paternal grandparents, particularly the Grandfather, I found it necessary for the paternal grandparents to learn the importance of holding boundaries in order to assist and support the Father and Mother in their efforts to co-parent C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     A report from the DSSA was again furnished to court after each tranche of supervised visitation orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     After the 2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending for a 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered. This was to enable the Father and C to continue bonding and for the Father to receive parenting modelling and intervention during the supervised visitation sessions at the DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The report further recommended that the paternal grandparents be included in the supervised visitation sessions so as to (i) provide the paternal grandparents with information on grandparenting and (ii) support the family in defining boundaries through modelling and psycho-education during the supervised visitation sessions, such as not undermining the Father's parental role. Simultaneously, the Father was recommended to attend the “Triple P Programme” to gain parental skills and confidence in bonding with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Orders were made in accordance with the recommendations and a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA thereafter, recommending for a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered and for counselling to continue for the parties and the paternal grandparents to explore the possibility of re-communication between parties and their extended families on child related matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It was noted from the report that the paternal grandparents were present for 4 out of the 8 supervised visitation sessions for the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche, and only during the second half of each session. It was further noted that following the counselling sessions and interventions received during the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, the Father was better able to maintain his parental role and exhibited firmness on what he wanted to do with the child for each session, notwithstanding the Grandfather's differing opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Parties voluntarily agreed to a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation being ordered, with the cost of the supervised visitation being borne by the Father solely. It is worth noting that the Mother was amenable to the participation of the paternal grandparents in the second half of all 8 sessions. At the case conference on 10 April 2023, orders were made accordingly with the consent of the parties. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between June to September 2023 (“4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Apart from supervised visitation orders at the DSSA, the Father also filed interim applications for access to the child outside of DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Chinese New Year Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 4 January 2023, the father filed an application in FC/SUM x4/2023 for the following orders, <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For access to C on Chinese New Year Eve and the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m., together with the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For additional weekly supervised access to C, outside of DSSA, every Wednesday from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For one-way supervised exchange to take place at noon every Saturday at DSSA, so that the Father may have supervised access to C outside of DSSA. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given the short time frame between the Father’s application and the Chinese New Year period, I heard parties on the application for supervised access during Chinese New Year first. On 13 January 2023, after hearing parties, I gave orders for the Father to have supervised access to C on Chinese New Year Eve at the DSSA from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. I also allowed the paternal grandparents to be present during the access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the Chinese New Year, the following orders were made with the consent of parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Father shall be granted access to C on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 am to 1.00 pm at Hillion Mall located at 17 Petir Road, Singapore 678278 (“Hillion Mall&quot;) as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Defendant shall handover the Child to the Plaintiff outside the premises of McDonald's located at level B1 of Hillion Mall;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The access shall take place in accordance to the Schedule of Itinerary appended to the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       In the event of any unforeseen changes to the itinerary proposed in the Schedule of Itinerary hereinabove, the Plaintiff shall keep the Defendant informed of any changes to the itinerary before proceeding to the venue of access in accordance with the amended itinerary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father's parents may be present at all times during the Plaintiff's access to the Child as stated above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is at liberty to observe the Father's access on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from a distance as long as the Mother's presence does not interfere with the Father's interactions with C during the said access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the end of the Father’s access, the Father shall hand over C to the Mother outside the premises of McDonald's.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The orders made above are without prejudice to any application by the Mother for the Father to have supervised access to C at the hearing of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_f\"></a>(f)     All other prayers in this Summons to be adjourned for further hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was no appeal filed against the Orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for additional weekly access and appointment of parent coordinator</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As mentioned earlier, FC/SUM x4/2023 was filed on 4 January 2023. After making the relevant orders in relation to Chinese New Year access, the remaining prayers were adjourned to be heard at a later date. This was to give the Mother time to file her affidavit in reply to the rest of the orders sought by the Father and for parties to file their submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As C was only three years of age at the time of the Father’s application, I indicated to parties that the appointment of a child representative may not be suitable, given her young and tender age. There was a real concern as to whether C was of the developmental age to be able to express her wishes to a child representative effectively in relation to the care and access arrangements sought by parties. The Court further queried if the appointment of a parent coordinator would be more appropriate in the circumstances to facilitate parties in their co-parenting efforts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In view of the Court’s indications above, the Father subsequently amended his application for the appointment of a parent coordinator to assist in the access arrangements with C. I noted that the main intention of the Father was to have a neutral party (i.e. someone other than the Mother or a person from the Father’s household) to supervise the interim access to C. This was because of the Mother’s insistence on supervised interim access pending the hearing of the main application and the submission of the Custody Evaluation Report (see paragraph 45 below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The main purpose of a parent coordinator is to assist parties in their co-parenting arrangements and to help parties communicate better and grow in their co-parenting skills. The hope at the end of the day is enable parties to function effectively, without the need of a parent coordinator, in their roles as co-parents. Given the tensions between parties in the present case, it was clear that if the Father was to have access to C outside of DSSA, parties would benefit from the appointment of a parent coordinator. It is unusual however for a parent coordinator to supervise access. Nevertheless, I note in the present case that the Father had obtained the consents of the proposed parent coordinators, Mr T and Ms X, both experienced and established family lawyers, to assist in the supervision of interim access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On 23 September 2023, the Father and the Mother attended the hearing together with their counsel. After hearing parties and taking note in particular of the Mother’s financial constraints and parties’ submissions in relation to the apportionment of the fees payable to the parenting coordinator, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Mr T is appointed parenting coordinator in this matter (the “Parenting Coordinator”) for an initial duration of 4 months from the date of this order, which may be extended by further order or agreement between the Father, the Mother and the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Parenting Coordinator shall accept or decline the appointment by filling up and returning to the Court the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance”. In the event that the Parenting Coordinator does not submit the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance” within 3 days of the Court notifying the Parenting Coordinator of the order, the Parenting Coordinator is deemed to have declined the appointment. Ms X or another parenting co-ordinator will be appointed in place of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Parties shall pay their share of the parenting coordination fees directly to the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Court allocates payment of fees for parenting coordination as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father will bear 100% cost of the first 1-hour joint session and 80% of any joint session thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Mother will bear 20% of the joint sessions thereafter, with the Father bearing 80%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Any solo sessions with the parent coordinator is to be borne by the parties respectively and the parties are at liberty to decline such solo sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The parties must, as far as practicable, provide to the parenting coordinator copies of all pleadings, documents and/or orders as may be requested by the parenting coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parenting coordinator may meet with the parties and/or C together or separately, in person or by any electronic means for a total number of 16 hours including the 1<sup>st</sup> joint 1 hour session held by the parenting coordinator, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Parties agree that they shall not hold the parenting coordinator liable for any damage or loss that they may incur in the course of or arising from the parenting coordination process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     With regard to the Father’s application for additional weekly access, the following orders were also made at the hearing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In addition to the supervised access at the DSSA, the Father shall be granted interim access to the Child in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator on alternate Wednesdays from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. at any one of the following locations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Bukit Timah Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bukit Panjang Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       West Mall Public Park</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Hillion Mall</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, parties agree that the interim access shall take place at all times in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father and, subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, the Parenting Coordinator shall pick up C from C’s childcare centre and return C thereafter to the Mother's residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father's parents, sister and helpers are not to be present during the interim supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Parties are at liberty to change the terms of access by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In making the above orders, I took into consideration the fact that there were times when access at the DSSA had to be rescheduled as C and the Mother were unavailable (e.g. due to illness). This resulted in the Father having irregular access to C. As such, I granted the Father an additional supervised weekly access day to C outside of the DSSA. Parties did not appeal against the orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Custody Evaluation Report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     On 31 March 2023, the Father filed FC/SUM xxx1/2023 for an order that a Custody Evaluation Report be submitted to address the suitability of parties being granted shared custody and shared care and control of C, or alternatively, that the Father has unsupervised and overnight access to C. I heard the application on 19 June 2023 and granted the orders sought. The Mother did not appeal against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Custody Evaluation Report was subsequently submitted to the Court on 4 October 2023, recommending that joint custody and shared care and control of C be granted to parties. In particular, that the Father be granted unsupervised overnight access from Mondays 17:00 hours to Thursdays 09:00 hours every alternate weeks, and from Thursdays 17:00 to Monday 09:00 hours every other week. It further recommended, <em>inter alia</em>, that both parties be at liberty to take C overseas for recreational purposes from age 5 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Parties were promptly informed briefly of the findings and recommendations of the Custody Evaluation Report at the next case conference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Exchange at DSSA</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Pursuant to the 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA recommending, <em>inter alia</em>, for the Father to have supervised exchange to C, subject to the following conditions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First two supervised exchange sessions between the Father and C to take place for 3 hours. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The subsequent six sessions between the Father and the child to take place for up to 4 hours, with liberty for the paternal grandparents to be present. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the supervised exchange sessions, the Father is to spend time with C at either his house, a mall, a library, a playground or a mutually agreeable venue near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Photographs and videos during the supervised exchange time to be taken by the Father and sent via the WhatsApp GroupChat (set up between parties and the caseworker/counsellor) to keep the Mother updated and to ensure C's safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     If there were signs of physical exhaustion in Child, Father is to inform Mother to pick up Child earlier than 3-4 hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     If the first three supervised exchange sessions were successful, the next five sessions can be done without the Mother having to bring Child to the DSSA for drop-off. Father and Mother can exchange the Child near their houses and inform the caseworker/ counsellor via WhatsApp GroupChat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although parties were largely agreeable with the recommendations made by the DSSA, the Mother objected to the Father bringing C back to his home during access as she was still concerned about the paternal grandparents influence on the Father and C, particularly the Grandfather, given her past experience and interactions with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On 7 November 2023, after hearing counsels’ submissions on behalf of parties and considering the recommendations of the DSSA reports, the following orders were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties to attend 8 sessions of supervised exchange, to take place at the DSSA as in accordance with the recommendations stated in the report, subject to the following variation to the recommendations: that at least the first three sessions of supervised exchange and access is to take place with the father and child alone for 3 hours. With regard to the venue for access, the counsellor is to work this out with the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother to attend Family Transition-Positive Parentings Programme (FT-Trip P). Parties to attend any other therapy or counselling session or programme as recommended by the caseworker/counsellor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father shall have access to the child on Christmas Day from 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. with liberty to the paternal grandparents to join the access session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Given that this was the 5<sup>th</sup> tranche of orders to be made, costs were payable by parties. The Grandfather volunteered to bear the costs for the supervised exchange sessions. As parties had no objections to the same, orders were made accordingly with the Grandfather’s consent. The supervised exchange sessions took place from December 2023 to April 2024. A further order for another 8 sessions of supervised exchange was subsequently made with the consent of parties on 11 April 2024. The 8 sessions took place from May to July 2024, which overlapped with the hearings of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot; Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is clear that the overriding and paramount principle is the welfare of the child. In <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> [1991] SLR 93, the Court of Appeal made the following observations in relation to the ‘welfare principle’ when custody is fought for:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children… We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    the conduct of the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   a young child would be best look after by its mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   which party can offer better security and stability; and,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflicts.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering whether shared care and control would be in the child's welfare, it was held in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a>, that the court has to consider factors such as that particular child's needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement and whether it is easy for the child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week. The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Supervised Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     With regard to whether a parent's access to a child ought to be supervised, it was held in <em>APE v APF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the noncustodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the noncustodial parent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the noncustodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child).&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Court in the above case went further to state at [33] that even if the child should view the non-custodial parent in a fearful or negative light, the Courts should nevertheless seek to repair the parent-child relationship where the circumstances permit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     With regard to whether there are serious welfare concerns in relation to the non-custodial parent, it was noted by the Court in <em>BKJ v BKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [23]-[25] that there must be a reasonable basis for the allegations of abuse or danger, and a mere unsubstantiated fear or suspicion is insufficient to justify supervised access. In that case, the Court found that while the Defendant Mother did not think much of the Plaintiff Father’s parenting skills, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s parenting skills were so very bad that the child would be in danger of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applying the Law to the Facts of the Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As parties agreed on joint custody, the issue in relation to care and control was whether the Court should grant sole care and control of C to the Mother, or shared care and control to parties in the present case. Although no appeal is made against my decision for sole care and control to be granted to the Mother, for totality I briefly set out my reasons why I did not grant shared care and control in the present case despite the recommendations of the custody evaluation report set out at paragraph 45 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Applying the law as set out in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> to the facts, I found that C was still of a tender young age. At the time of the hearing, she had turned 4 years of age only recently, on 13 June 2024. It is not disputed that the Mother has been the primary caregiver of C since birth. Uprooting a young child, like C, every 3-4 days to live in two different households would be overly disruptive for her development since young children require a familiar and secure environment to grow in and seek refuge in when confronted with the challenges of growing up. To exacerbate matters, given the differences between parties in their values and approaches to parenting, if shared care and control is ordered, a sense of dislocation may result where C is torn between two households where there are competing primary caregivers and approaches to her upbringing. (<em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a> at paragraphs [17] to [19].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Regarding the Father's concern about sending the wrong signal to the Mother if shared care and control was not granted, I did not agree with the Father’s submissions that the effect of not granting such an order would be the Court acceding and condoning the Defendant's alleged selfish acts of wilful assertion of her authority over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As highlighted in <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20688-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 213</a> at [75], the court would not give much weight to any potential signalling effect of a shared care and control order. Any signalling effect is dealt with by the custody order. In this case, the granting of joint custody will signal the important role that both parents play as persons with parental authority in making decisions in relation to the child. On the other hand, care and control orders are mainly concerned with the practicalities of day-to-day care of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In relation to the issue of access, I note that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father unsupervised access. It was clear from the evidence provided before the Court and the various reports submitted, that there were no issues of serious welfare concerns regarding the Father, such as violence or inappropriate parenting if C was left unsupervised in his care. I note furthermore that the relationship between C and the Father was not estranged, such that it needed reparation and supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother’s main contention pertains to specific orders relating to weekly overnight access and public holiday access (excluding access during Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year) as per the orders made on 23 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ submissions on overnight and public holiday access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     At the hearing on 17 July 2024, the Mother objected to the Father’s application for overnight access as C was still of a young age - she had just turned 4 years old. C has also been sleeping with the Mother since birth and latches to the Mother at night before she sleeps. Further, whenever C wakes up in the middle of the night, she is soothed back to sleep by the Mother. Thus, it would be traumatic for C to spend the night alone with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father on the other hand submitted that notwithstanding the above, he believed that C, who attends childcare, would be able to adjust easily to spending overnight access with him at his family home. He noted that C displayed no signs of upset or distress during the supervised exchange sessions that took place at his family home. Evidence was also provided by the Father to show that he had taken steps to make the family home suitable for overnight access to take place, such as by preparing a room for C, complete with a child’s bed, toys and a toddler-sized table with chairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In relation to Public Holiday access, I note from the Mother’s affidavits filed and both written and oral submissions made to the Court that, apart from the major public holidays like Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, no specific orders in relation to Public Holiday access were sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Father sought for Public Holiday access to be specified so as to avoid conflict between parties in terms of the access arrangements. Excluding Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, the Father specifically sought for access to be granted to him on the following Public Holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     National Day;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Good Friday;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Deepavali and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Vesak Day</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Court’s Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I commend the Mother and Father for their efforts in encouraging C to build and maintain her relationship with both parents. I noted from the reports that C is a happy child who is comfortable spending time with the Mother, Father and her extended family. There are no signs of triangulation of the child between parties, notwithstanding the breakdown in the relationship of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In view of the above, although I did not grant the Father shared care and control of the child, I allowed him overnight access to C upon C turning 5 years of age. I noted from the evidence and the reports that the Father was able to care for and bond with C independently in the absence of the Mother. I noted further from the case authorities provided by parties that overnight access was usually granted upon the child turning 5 years of age. There was no reason in the present case not to grant the Father overnight access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I was not persuaded by the Mother’s submission that overnight access would disrupt C’s breastfeeding routine or that such an order would be traumatic to C. Since the order for overnight access was to begin only upon C reaching the age of five, I did not find the order for overnight access to be disruptive to C’s current breastfeeding routine. Time was factored in for the Mother to assist in the adjustment of C to the overnight access arrangements. Furthermore, I noted from the evidence of parties and the reports submitted that C was comfortable being alone with the Father. There was no evidence in the affidavits of C exhibiting any separation anxiety from the Mother. As such, I did not think that an order for overnight access upon C turning 5 years of age would cause the child unwarranted trauma.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     From the Mother’s affidavit and submissions against shared care and control, it was clear that the Mother was also concerned about the overbearingness of the Grandfather and the impact it would have on the Father and C, if C was to live at the Fathers’ family home. These concerns would apply as well if overnight access was to be ordered. However, I found these concerns to be speculative. While the Grandfather may have exhibited domineering behaviours towards the Mother, there is no evidence of such behaviour being exhibited towards the child. More importantly, I note that the Father is now better able to hold his ground and parent the child confidently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Since C would have regular weekly access to the Father on Wednesday (4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.) and Friday (4.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.) and almost the entire day Saturday from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., to allow parties to transition smoothly to overnight access, I allowed the Father to have overnight access to C from Friday, 4.30 p.m. to Sunday 9.30 a.m. This would ensure regularity for C and allow the Mother to have one day as well on the weekend with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     In relation to the orders for Public Holiday access, I noted that there were no objections from the Mother to the Father’s request at the hearings. As such, given that C would be with the Mother on the remaining three Public Holidays (namely Labour Day, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji) as understood by parties at the hearing, orders were made accordingly for the Father to have access to C on the requested Public Holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding Remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     This is a case where the relationship between parties unfortunately broke down due to the tension in the relationship between a newly established family unit and the extended family members. It is clear from the incidents set out in the affidavits that, while all involved had good intentions towards the child, the differences in values and approach in parenting amongst them resulted in hostility and acrimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     While it is true that the Mother and Father are the main persons responsible for their co-parental relationship, it is undeniable that the co-parental relationship is subject to challenges especially in situations where one party may be inextricably dependent on the emotional and psychological support provided by the extended family, unfortunately to the exclusion of the other party. For the co-parental relationship to be effective, it is therefore necessary for all parties involved to learn the importance of boundaries and equip themselves with the skills necessary to help build and support the co-parental relationship for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Nevertheless, I commend parties in the present case for their continued efforts in working on their co-parental relationship and I would like to encourage both parties to continue to create an environment where C may be able to benefit from having access to the love and support of both the maternal and paternal families in her life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I would also like to commend both counsels who represented parties in this matter for working tirelessly to help parties work out the care and access arrangements throughout the duration of this matter for the benefit of C.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Application to revoke a personal protection order – Whether the alleged abuse of a personal protection order by a protected person is a ground to revoke the order – Approach where an applicant is alleged to have breached the order","Evidence – Burden of proof – Whether an applicant has proved his case for revoking a personal protection order – Factual findings of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved” under s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893"],"date":"2024-12-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 1031 of 2024","title":"XGG v XGH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 111","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32623-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gurdaib Kumar Singh and Ms Divya Durai (M/s Regal Law LLC) for the Applicant","Respondent in person."],"timestamp":"2024-12-20T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XGG v XGH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGG <em>v</em> XGH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32623-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 111</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Can a PPO be revoked on the sole basis that the person it seeks to protect (“<b>protected person</b>”) has allegedly abused the order? How should a court deal with an application to revoke a PPO where the applicant is alleged to have breached the order? These are some of the issues raised in SS 1031 of 2024 (“<b>SS 1031</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 1031 is the Applicant’s request to revoke a PPO made against him. The PPO was imposed in 2018 pursuant to an application by his ex-wife (“<b>Respondent</b>”). Under the PPO, the Applicant is not to commit family violence against the Respondent and her son (his stepson).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties’ marriage was dissolved in February 2024. Following the divorce –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent has care and control of her daughter (D.O.B.: January 2016) that she bore with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     She resides with her daughter and her son (now 21 years old) in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant resides with his mother in the next block of flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of this judgement, the Respondent has a fiancé. They are due to be married in December 2024. The Applicant, on the other hand, has a girlfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ position </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Applicant provides two reasons to support his application to revoke the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he alleges that the Respondent has “abused” the PPO – namely, (i) by making false complaints to the Police that he had breached the order,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (ii) by picking arguments with him so that she could play the “victim”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and (iii) by harassing and slandering him on social media.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Applicant submits that the PPO is no longer necessary. It was granted six years ago. The parties are now residing in different households and there has been no recent incident of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Respondent strong denies the Applicant’s allegations and objects to his application. According to the Respondent, the PPO is still necessary for the protection of her son and herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summary of decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the evidence and submissions, I dismiss the application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged abuse of PPO not proved</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with the Applicant’s first reason as to why the PPO ought to be revoked – namely that the Respondent has allegedly “abused” the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Requirement for revocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, it should be noted that the mere fact that a protected person may have “abused” a PPO is not a sufficient basis to revoke the order. This is because the test for revocation is <em>whether a PPO is still necessary</em> to protect that person. To succeed in a revocation application, the applicant must thus prove that he/she “is unlikely” to commit family violence in future: s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). This position is well settled: see e.g., <em>Joycelyn Toh Hui Yu v Toh Siew Luan Bette</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0275.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 275</a> at [17(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     To be clear, the above position does not mean that a protected person can use a PPO as an instrument of oppression. Depending on the circumstances, a person who has been victimised by a protected person can apply for a PPO against the latter. Additionally, the protected person may also be criminally liable, e.g., under s 182 of the Penal Code 1871 if he/she makes a false police report that a PPO has been breached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Allegations of abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In his affidavit, the Applicant referred to several incidents where the Respondent had allegedly “abused” the PPO. During the hearing, he agreed to focus on four of them. I will now address each of these allegations, <em>first</em>, whether the Applicant has proved these four incidents of “abuse”, and <em>second</em>, whether the PPO is no longer necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2 June 2024 incident – Applicant checking on his daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I begin with an incident on 2 June 2024. (This incident occurred just <em>one day before</em> the Applicant filed his application to revoke the PPO.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>) His account of this incident is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On that day at about 2.00 am, while in the carpark, the Applicant noticed that the light in the matrimonial flat’s master-bedroom was switched on. The Applicant decided to check on his daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On entering the flat unit, the Applicant saw that nobody was at home. Anxious at being unable to find his daughter, the Applicant phoned the Respondent to check. The Respondent responded with vulgarities and told him to wait with his girlfriend at the void deck for her to come over. The Applicant made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the Applicant returned to the matrimonial flat, the Respondent refused to let him enter, claiming that she had been advised to do so by the Investigation Officer (“<b>IO</b>”). The Applicant called the IO. The latter denied having given such advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She was in fact at home with her children at the material time. At about 2.39 am, she received a phone call from an unknown woman who screamed and used vulgarities at her. The woman also asked her to go to the void deck. When the Respondent looked over the parapet, she saw the Applicant and another man downstairs. They were walking towards her block in an unsteady manner – apparently under the influence of alcohol.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Soon thereafter, the Applicant was outside the matrimonial flat. He scolded the Respondent and threatened to bash her up. He did not request to speak to the daughter at all material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A few minutes later, the Respondent heard the Applicant shouting from the carpark and asking her to come down. (According to the Respondent, she has a <em>voice recording</em> of this. She however did not tender the recording as evidence because it was not transcribed.) The Applicant stopped shouting on being alerted by his girlfriend and his male companion that the Respondent was recording the incident. The Respondent tendered a video recording of the incident as evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Later, the Applicant, his girlfriend, and his male companion took turns to call the Respondent’s handphone. In these calls, they scolded her and threatened to beat her up. The Respondent hung up the phone and called the Police. During the trial, she tendered her call log to prove that she had received numerous phone calls from the Applicant, his girlfriend and an unidentified number at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Police eventually arrived at the scene. Police officer(s) told the Respondent that the Applicant had been drinking under her block of flats. According to her, the Police could confirm that her daughter was in the flat unit at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Respondent believes that the 2 June incident was triggered by a video that she had posted regarding the Applicant’s girlfriend on 30 May 2024. According to the Respondent, this posting irritated the Applicant. Since then, he had started to threaten her over the phone. Before posting the video, the Applicant was fine. The Respondent understands from the IO that the police investigations into the 2 June incident have been completed, and that the matter is now with the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I find that the Applicant has “not proved” his case regarding the 2 June incident on a balance of probabilities. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is unusual that a right-thinking father would choose to visit his eight-year-old daughter in the middle of the night <em>at 2.00 am</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is an <em>inexplicable gap</em> in the Applicant’s evidence. Based on his account, he had gone to the matrimonial flat twice. On the first occasion, he had entered the flat unit and found that no one was at home. On the second occasion, the Respondent was in the flat unit and refused to let him enter. The duration between these two occasions would have been brief. Based on the Applicant’s evidence, the Respondent had mysteriously turned up at the unit. (This is despite she having told him to wait at the void deck for her.) The Applicant did not explain how this was possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, I find the Respondent’s evidence that she and her children were resting at home at about 2.00 am to be inherently more credible. Furthermore, her evidence that the Applicant, his girlfriend, and another man had called her phone at the material time is also supported by her call log.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     For clarity, in coming to the finding in [15(c)], I did not rely on the video recording tendered by the Respondent. I find this recording to be a neutral piece of evidence. As the Applicant had rightly submitted, the recording does not contain any audio and thus does not prove that the Applicant was shouting at the material time. In any event, the Applicant does not dispute the fact that he was in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the time of the recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To be clear, the finding in [15] above does not mean that I have found any of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Applicant has lied about the 2 June incident,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Respondent has “disproved” the Applicant’s case about the incident, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That she has “proved” her own account of the incident to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>(For a discussion on the concepts of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved”, see s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893; <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0286.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 286</a> at [18] to [21]; <em>R Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0063.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 63</a> at [35].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I emphatically decline to make the affirmative findings in [16] above. Such findings would have been based purely on the <em>testimonial</em> evidence by the Applicant and the Respondent only. I do not think that this is appropriate in the present case. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I do not have the benefit of important pieces of evidence that can shed light on what really happened during the 2 June incident. Such evidence includes the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       A voice recording of the Applicant asking the Respondent to come down from the matrimonial flat: see [13(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Evidence (e.g., from police officers present at the scene) on (1) whether the daughter was in the flat at the material time (see [12(b)] and [13(a)] above), (2) whether the Applicant appeared to intoxicated (see [13(e)] above), (3) whether he was in the company of his girlfriend and another male person (see [13(c)] and [13(d)] above), and (4) the Applicant’s and Respondent’s contemporaneous accounts to the police officers of what had transpired during the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Police have completed their investigations into the 2 June incident. The matter is now before AGC, presumably for a decision on whether there is any offence disclosed against the Applicant and/or the Respondent, and if so, whether to prosecute the relevant party. An affirmative finding by me, such as those in [16] above, (i) can potentially engage the principle of <em>res judicata</em> on some of the relevant factual issues, and (ii) can have implications on the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion and subsequent criminal proceedings, if any. Given the limitations of fact finding in [17(a)] above, it is best that I exercise judicial modesty and refrain from making affirmative findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To sum-up, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the 2 June incident had occurred in the manner described by the Applicant. Furthermore, even on his account, I fail to see in what way the Respondent’s actions amount to an “abuse” of the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">29 June 2024 incident – Respondent’s visit to the mother’s flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I now turn to another incident which, according to the Applicant, demonstrates that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 29 June 2024, together with her son and other person(s), the Respondent “trespassed” into his mother’s flat unit. At the material time, his mother was alone. The Applicant came to know of this “trespass” when the Respondent’s son, and later the Respondent herself, made threatening calls to him and told him to go down to the mother’s flat. The Police was eventually summoned and the incident was defused thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Applicant tendered a video recording of the events at the flat unit as evidence. According to him, the recording showed the Respondent to be have snatched his mother’s handphone and to be behaving aggressively in the flat. The Applicant submitted that if the Respondent had been fearful of him, she would not have behaved in such a manner and demanded to see him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the Applicant, his mother was deeply disturbed by the Respondent’s actions on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent was troubled by the 2 June incident. On 29 June 2024, she had gone to seek the mother’s help to stop the Applicant and his girlfriend from creating problems for her and her children. The Respondent knew that the Applicant was not at home at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had entered the mother’s flat unit with her son and a female relative. While in the unit, the Respondent admitted that she had taken the mother’s phone. According to her, she merely wanted the mother to call the Applicant and to tell him to stop the harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the visit, the Respondent saw the mother at the market on 5 August 2024. The mother called out to her, and they spoke normally. Later that same day, the mother phoned the Respondent. (This call is reflected in the Respondent’s call log.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>) She submitted that if the mother had felt threatened by her due to the 29 June incident, the mother would not have spoken to her. The Respondent recorded her conversation with the mother on 5 August 2024. She however did not tender the recording in evidence because she could not afford the transcription fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my view, the Applicant has failed to prove his case that the 29 June incident was an example of the Respondent having “abused” the PPO. Specifically, the Applicant has failed to show how the Respondent had used the PPO to legitimise or excuse her conduct at his mother’s flat unit. I accept the Respondent’s reasons for going to the mother’s flat and that she was not there to create trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is clear from the recording that the Respondent was emotional at certain points during the visit. For instance, she broke down when she spoke to the Applicant’s mother – at times, telling her son that it was not the mother’s fault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This is consistent with the Respondent’s evidence that she was genuinely concerned and stressed by what the Applicant had done during the 2 June incident, and that she had gone to the flat to seek the mother’s help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it appears from the videos<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the Respondent’s son was also crying/sobbing when he spoke to the Applicant’s mother. At times, he was rubbing his eyes with what appears to be white tissue paper. There was also a moment when the son told the Respondent that he loved the Applicant’s mother, and the Respondent acknowledged this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, throughout her interaction with the Respondent and her son, the Applicant’s mother appears to be calm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, and importantly, the only other person who can discredit the Respondent’s evidence regarding the purpose of her visit on 29 June is the Applicant’s mother. She would have been able to testify, for instance, what had transpired during the visit and what the Respondent and her son had said to her. The Applicant did not call his mother to rebut the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Given the above, I find that the 29<sup></sup>June incident does not prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">16 September 2024 incident – Applicant’s visit to the matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to next incident which the Applicant relies on to prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 16 September 2024, the Applicant visited the matrimonial flat intending to see his daughter. On arriving at the flat unit, the Respondent’s fiancé, who was shirtless at the material time, came out from one of the rooms and started to provoke him. The Respondent and her son stood nearby, supporting the fiancé.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fiancé challenged the Applicant to a fight, and the ensuing argument continued out into the corridor. The Applicant remained calm throughout as his daughter was present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The fiancé and the Respondent later returned to the flat unit. The latter locked the gate, claiming that the IO had told her not to open the gate for him. The Applicant called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Police arrived at the scene, the fiancé eventually left the flat unit angrily and reluctantly, on the Police’s request. The Applicant tendered a video recording of the incident to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent’s evidence regarding the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant had gone to the matrimonial flat to look for his daughter. The visit was unexpected as 16 September 2024 was not his child access day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Respondent, the Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the material time and had behaved in an abusive and provocative manner towards her fiancé. When her son tried to intervene because the Applicant was standing too close to her, the Applicant smacked his chest and verbally abused him. When the Respondent intervened, the Applicant grabbed her hand tightly. She managed to pull her hand away and her fiancé stepped in to de-escalate the matter. The Respondent called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent understood from the IO that the Police have completed their investigations into the 16 September incident, and that the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is the Applicant’s case that the Respondent is using the PPO to prevent him from visiting the matrimonial flat to see his daughter. According to him, the Respondent is doing this so that she can cohabit with her fiancé in the matrimonial flat without any interference from the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I find that the events during the 16 September incident do not support the Applicant’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant’s case assumes that he had the right to see his daughter on 16 September 2024 and that the Respondent had wrongfully prevented him from doing so. This assumption is not correct. According to the Respondent, (i) 16 September 2024 was not the Applicant’s child access day, and (ii) he had turned up at the matrimonial flat without giving any prior notice. The Applicant did not dispute this aspect of the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is evident from the video that the Applicant was unhappy with the fiancé’s presence in the flat and had taunted the Respondent, her son, and her fiancé. Given the tension at the material time, there could be safety issues if the Applicant was allowed into the flat. In the circumstances, the Respondent’s decision not to let the Applicant into the flat is understandable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, I find the Applicant’s claim that the Respondent has an ulterior motive to prevent him from seeing his daughter to be highly speculative. He has offered no evidence to prove that the fiancé was cohabiting with the Respondent in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given the above, I find that the Applicant has failed to prove that the 29<sup></sup>June incident is an example where the Respondent had “abused” the PPO for an alleged ulterior motive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">May to December 2023 – Respondent’s messages</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Finally, according to the Applicant, between May to December 2023, the Respondent (a) had made repeated phone calls and sent numerous messages to harass him and his girlfriend and (b) had posted libellous comments on social media against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Respondent denied making some of the relevant posts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> She explained that her (Facebook) account had been hacked at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I have difficulty accepting the Respondent’s explanation. For instance, there is no reason why the alleged hacker would send the relevant posts – e.g., new year greetings, and vitriolic comments on the affair between the Applicant and his girlfriend. Additionally, some of the posts contain information that is personal to the Respondent. That said, a determination of whether the Respondent’s Facebook account had been hacked is best made after forensic analysis has been done on the account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In any event, assuming that the relevant messages, phone calls, and posts were by the Respondent, I fail to see how they would amount to be an “abuse” of the PPO that warrants its revocation. For instance, there is no evidence that the Respondent had used the PPO as a shield for sending the objectionable messages, phone calls and posts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Applicant submits that the PPO should be revoked because the Respondent is not afraid of him or to do things which offends him. In my view, this argument does not take his case far. The central issue remains whether the Respondent and her son require the PPO for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO is still necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     This neatly brings me to the Applicant’s second reason for his application. According to him, the PPO is no longer necessary because the parties are now living apart and there has been no recent incident of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is well settled that the mere fact that parties have divorced and are no longer residing together do not constitute sufficient grounds for revoking a PPO: see e.g., <em>IS v IT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46932-M.xml')\">[2005] SGDC 66</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the present case, even though the parties are now living in separate households, I cannot rule out the possibility that the Applicant is likely to commit family violence in future. These are my reasons for coming to this view.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the parties will still need to interact with each other when the Applicant exercises his child access rights at the Respondent’s place of residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is still tension in the parties’ relationship. One of the causes for this tension is the Applicant’s unhappiness and concern that the fiancé is in contact with his daughter. This sentiment is one of the triggers for the 16 September incident – which occurred just three months before the date of this judgement. The Applicant’s unhappiness and concern will only increase when the Respondent and her fiancé live together after their marriage in December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is also evidence to suggest that the Applicant may have triggered the 2 June incident, created a scene, and threatened the Respondent with physical violence: see [13(b)] and [13(d)] above. The Police has completed their investigations into this incident and the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">26 September 2024 incident – Applicant allegedly assaulted the Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, and disturbingly, the Respondent has accused the Applicant of having committed yet another act of family violence just about two weeks before the hearing was due to start. According to her, the Applicant punched her face and kicked her leg in the evening of 26 September 2024. The alleged assault occurred when she was walking down her block of flats. After the assault, the Applicant allegedly told her that this was a “trial” and threatened to “whack” her again “soon”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> During the trial, the Respondent tendered photographs and a medical form to show that she had a bruise on her right chin and bruise/abrasion on her right thigh one day after the alleged assault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> According to the Respondent, police investigations into this incident are ongoing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Applicant strongly denied the Respondent’s allegations. While he admitted to being in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the material time (to exercise at an area downstairs), he denied meeting her. The Applicant submitted that her evidence should be disbelieved for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no witness to the alleged assault, despite it having occurred during “peak hour”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had made a police report about the assault only one day after the alleged incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the medical form, the Respondent “updated” that an e-scooter had also collided into her from the front.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Applicant submitted that the Respondent’s thigh injury is consistent with such a collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_d\"></a>(d)     One day after the alleged assault, there were text messages between the Respondent and the Applicant. She did not mention anything about the assault in those messages. During the hearing, the Applicant tendered the relevant messages to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Applicant was not arrested in connection with the alleged assault. The IO apparently told him that this was because the Police believed that he was innocent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I am not persuaded by the Applicant’s submissions. In my view, it is not appropriate for me to reject the Respondent’s allegation of the assault outright.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Regarding [37(a)] – The mere absence of eyewitnesses is equivocal and does not disprove the alleged assault. This fact is equally consistent with the possibility that the assault may have been <em>premediated</em> – i.e., the Applicant might have <em>chosen</em> a moment or a location to assault the Respondent away from public eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding [37(b)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       During her examination-in-chief, the Respondent had explained that soon after the alleged assault, she called the IO. The IO returned her call only <em>the next day.</em> He told her to lodge a police report and that he would follow-up thereafter. The Respondent promptly made the report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In any event, I am of the view there is no undue delay in the Respondent lodging the police report. The report was lodged just one day after the alleged assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Regarding [37(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Respondent, the collision was a minor one and had merely caused her to fall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, the Applicant’s submission fails to account for the undisputed bruise on the Respondent’s right chin. The Applicant conceded during cross-examination that such an injury is more consistent with it having been caused by a punch than an e-scooter collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Regarding [37(d)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is not correct to say that the Respondent had failed to mention anything in her text messages about the alleged assault one day after the incident. In one of these messages, the Respondent did ask the Applicant why he had transferred $316 to her, and whether it was “Doc fees for what u did”. The Respondent explained during the hearing that in this message, she was trying to clarify with the Applicant whether he had transferred the money to cover her medical expenses arising from the assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In his text message, the Applicant replied that the $136 was an “instalment” payment of the daughter’s maintenance. I find this reply to be puzzling. <em>First</em>, the Respondent testified that the Applicant had not paid maintenance by instalment before. The Applicant did not dispute this evidence. <em>Second</em>, it is strange why the Applicant chose to make an instalment payment of $136 – considering that the maintenance amount is $950.

They had four daughters. As to why the marriage had broken down, that is set out in some detail in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The SOP states that the Husband had been abusive towards the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 September 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 13 June 2024. Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After parties had filed their first set of affidavit of assets and means (“AOMs”), the Wife took out an application in SUM 3168/2024 (“SUM 3168”). She sought leave for her four daughters to file a joint affidavit. The purpose of this joint affidavit was to respond to a point which the Husband had made in his AOM. The Husband had, according to the Wife, falsely alleged that certain pieces of jewellery acquired during the marriage were all his financial contributions. On this basis, the Wife states that it was necessary for the four daughters to “affirm their respective knowledge about the gold jewel[l]eries” which she had purchased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 3168 came up for hearing before me. I reserved judgment after hearing arguments from both parties. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where a party to divorce proceeding seeks to file an affidavit by a third party, leave of the court must be sought. That was a point made clear in the recent decision of the Family Division of the High Court in <em>WWM v WWN and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> (“<em>WWM</em>”) at [4]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4     First, I agree with counsel for the Husband that the plain wording of rr 89(2) and 89(3) FJR provides for a total of two AM affidavits by each party and any further affidavits beyond the two require leave of court. Nothing in the wording of r 89 FJR supports the Wife’s interpretation for two rounds of affidavits. Second, had the Wife exhibited the Children’s Affidavits in her second affidavit, the court could have likewise expunged those exhibits. <b>I thus do not accept the Wife’s interpretation of r 89 FJR. The affidavits of means envisaged under that rule are intended to be those of the parties themselves. </b><b><u>Any others may be filed only with leave.</u></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>[</u>emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In deciding whether leave should be granted, a key consideration is the relevance and necessity of the affidavit of the third-party to the hearing of the ancillary matters hearing (see <em>WWM</em> (at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       To assess the relevance and necessity of the joint affidavit which the Wife is seeking leave to file, I take, as the starting point, what each party had set out in their first AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This was what the Husband had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Just and equitable division of the jewelleries in the possession of the Plaintiff and other household items removed from the flat. During one of my hospitalisations, the Plaintiff who was then briefly staying at my daughter’s place came over to remove all the jewelleries from the flat. These are jewelleries acquired during the marriage which were all my financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This was what the Wife had said in relation to the gold jewellery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I own other assets as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    I had received the sum of $43,000.00 being my Dependent Protection Sum monies from XX in December 2017…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    I purchased 916 gold jewellery items for the total value of $32,519.64 namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">3 necklace</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 chains (including 2 young children ones)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">6 pair bangles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bangle</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 pendants</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">5 adult rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">2 children rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 earrings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bracelet</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 chain with pendant</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 ring</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    all my said gold jewellery items are in the [Husband’s] possession as my 3 younger daughters and I left the matrimonial Flat in November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Based on what the Husband and the Wife had set out in their respective first AOMs, the relevance of the proposed joint affidavit cannot be seriously disputed. It deals with the issue of who had bought the jewellery, and whether that jewellery had indeed been taken from the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As to the necessity of the proposed joint affidavit, counsel for the Husband, Mr Arul Suppiah (“Mr Arul”), had, during the hearing, pointed out that the court hearing the ancillary matters was well placed to draw its own inferences from what had been set out in the affidavits that had been filed by both the Husband and the Wife. Following this line of logic, there was no need for the proposed joint affidavit to be filed. This was especially since the four daughters were already biased against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Counsel for the Wife, Ms Gurmeet Kaur (“Ms Kaur”), however, argued that the daughters’ evidence was needed to corroborate the Wife’s version of events – namely, that it was the Wife who had purchased the jewellery with her own money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to whether the daughters are indeed biased against the Husband, that is not a matter which can be decided at this juncture. That is for the judge hearing the ancillary matters to consider, in weighing up the evidence given by the four daughters in the proposed joint affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In my judgment, the proposed joint affidavit is indeed necessary in that it would cast light on whether it was the Husband or the Wife who had bought the jewellery, and the source of funds used to purchase the jewellery. The proposed joint affidavit may corroborate either the Husband or the Wife’s account as to how the jewellery was acquired, and whether the jewellery is still in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Leave is therefore granted to the Wife to file the proposed joint affidavit. That affidavit shall be filed by 19 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Parties shall write in, by way of letter to court, with their submissions on costs. The submissions shall not exceed 3 pages, and must be filed no later than 27 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here should be taken as binding the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It remains for me to thank Ms Kaur and Mr Arul for their able assistance.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-12-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2861 of 2023 (Summons No 2758 of 2024)","title":"XEH v XEI","citation":"[2024] SGFC 108","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32608-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Michael Han Hean Juan (Han & Lu Law Chambers LLP) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-12-14T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XEH v XEI</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEH <em>v</em> XEI </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32608-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 108</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2861 of 2023 (Summons No 2758 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 December 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Michael Han Hean Juan (Han &amp; Lu Law Chambers LLP) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XEH — XEI </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 2758/2024 (“SUM 2758”) which was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. I had earlier made orders in respect of SUM 2758: see <em>XEH v XEI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32433-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 93</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Han, argues that costs should be fixed at $2500 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife to the Husband. The reason for this is that the Husband, having succeeded in SUM 2758, was therefore entitled to costs. As to the quantum of such costs, Mr Han justifies the sum the Husband is seeking on the basis of the work done for SUM 2758.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In addition, Mr Han also refers to the State Court Practice Directions 2021 Appendix H: <em>Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards in District Court Cases in the State Courts of Singapore</em> to show that the quantum of $2500 was not a wholly unreasonable sum to seek.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife, on the other hand, filed her submissions on costs late in the day. I had directed parties to file their submissions on costs by 25 October 2024. On 1 November 2024, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Wife, informing her that these submissions on costs were to be filed by 8 November 2024, failing which, the court would proceed to make costs orders in respect of SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 November 2024, the Wife sent an email to the Family Court Registry enclosing a number of documents. This appeared to be an attempt to comply with the orders I had made in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Also contained in that email was the Wife’s written submissions on the costs of SUM 2758. In those set of submissions, the Wife argues that she should not have to pay costs of $2500 to the Husband. She gives two reasons. First, that the Husband had filed his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories late.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Second, that the Husband had, in taking out SUM 2758, caused further delays in the hearing of the ancillary matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Where costs are concerned, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event – in other words, the successful party is entitled to costs. The court, however, can depart from this starting point: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the present case, the Husband is the successful party in that he had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items he had sought in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       He is therefore entitled to costs. I see no reason to depart from the starting point that costs shall follow the event. While it is true that the Husband had only served his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories 13 days after the deadline set by the court, this was, in my judgment, not such a lengthy delay which justified departing from the starting point that costs shall follow the event: see Rule 852 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $1600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of costs, I considered the number of items sought as well as the fact that SUM 2758 did not involve any novel points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In particular, I took into account the Wife’s conduct. I note from the minutes of the previous case conferences<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that the Wife had told the court that she was not going to respond to any voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories that the Husband might serve on her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She had also told the court that she would not file a reply affidavit to SUM 2758 because it was a “waste of time” and that she had neither the time nor the energy to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The voluntary disclosure regime in the context of discovery and interrogatories provides parties the opportunity to ask for documents and information that may have a bearing on the issues in dispute without having to take out a formal application to court. This, of course, can only work if the party on whom the voluntary request is served takes a sensible approach, and does not unreasonably object, or refuse to provide documents sought or give responses to interrogatories. If that party chooses to not respond to the voluntary request, they must then accept that the requesting party is then entitled to, as a matter of procedure, take out the relevant application: see Rule 63(4) FJR 2014. This would, naturally, result in a delay to the hearing of the ancillary matters whilst the application for discovery and/or interrogatories is heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Had the Wife made an attempt to respond to the Husband’s voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, there may not have been a need for SUM 2758, or that the items sought in SUM 2758 could have been reduced. She chose to not engage with the Husband’s voluntary request, or his application in SUM 2758 (see above at [10]).

I heard the parties and granted the Father’s application. The Mother appeals against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child’s Mother is the Plaintiff, and the child’s Father is the Defendant in the principal case, which was a divorce proceeding. The parents had married in June 2011 in Norway. At all material times, the Mother is a Singaporean and the Father a Norwegian. They lived in Norway for a few years and then moved to Singapore. Their relationship broke down, and by consent, they were divorced by an interim judgment in May 2017. The ancillary issues were not agreed upon. I heard and decided the ancillary issues in December 2018. The relevant part of my order stated as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The parents shall have Joint Custody of the child with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father shall have access as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Every Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekday access”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Every Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekend Access”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    From 1 June 2019, the Weekday access shall remain or adjusted to different days if agreed to by parties, or else shall remain the same; and weekend access shall be on alternate weekends Saturday 10 a.m. overnight to Sunday 2 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father is permitted to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from 2019. The Defendant shall ensure that the child is returned to Singapore to the Plaintiff no later than 30 December immediately thereafter. The Plaintiff shall release the child’s passport to the Defendant for this purpose. The Plaintiff shall also furnish the passport details of the child to the Defendant to enable travel arrangements to be made. The Defendant shall furnish the details of the visit including the travel documents and the addresses where the child shall be at to the Plaintiff in exchange for the child’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother appealed against my whole decision. Her appeal was heard in December 2019. The appeal was heard by the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon who made the following orders on the issue of the child (“the Order”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1</em>.     <em>Custody, care and control</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For the avoidance of doubt, as ordered by the District Judge in FC/ORC 1115/2019, the parties shall have Joint Custody of the child of the marriage, B (&quot;the Child&quot;), with care and control to the Plaintiff/Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>2</em>.     <em>Access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The orders of the District Judge for access in FC/ORC 1115/2019 are upheld, save as shown to be varied below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>.     <em>Weekday access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30 pm to 8.45 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>.     <em>Weekend access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child on alternative weekends from 10.00 am on Saturdays to 2.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>c</em>.     <em>Overseas access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall be permitted to bring the Child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall ensure that the Child is returned to the Plaintiff/Mother in Singapore no later than 30th day of that December immediately after the temporary visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother is to keep the Child’s passport and maintain its validity for travels. She shall furnish the details of the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father to enable travel arrangements to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall furnish to the Plaintiff/Mother the details of the visits, including the travel documents and the addresses of places where the Child will be at no later than 21 days before the trip, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall release the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father no later than 7 days before the trip.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Child’s passport shall be handed back to the Plaintiff/Mother together with the Child after the visits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother shall inform the Defendant/Father whenever the Child travels overseas before such trips. Save for travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father this information no later than 21 days before the trips. For travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the information shall be provided to the Defendant/Father once the trip is confirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>d</em>.     <em>Increase in length of overnight access sessions</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Parties are to endeavour to agree on having overnight access sessions for the Defendant/Father of longer durations, in particular during the Child’s school holidays, between now and December 2020. In the event that there is no agreement by the end of January 2020, either party may file an application to the Family Court to formalise the arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>e</em>.     <em>Pick-up point</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">For the access, the Defendant/Father shall pick-up and return the Child to the condominium where the Child resides, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father an access card key to the entrance of the condominium to facilitate the pick-up and return of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father had access to the child from after December 2018 when I made my order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In August 2022, due to an altercation between the Father and the Mother regarding access, both parents filed applications for personal protections orders against each other. In the course of those proceedings, the Father agreed to undergo a POTS (Panel of Therapeutic Specialists) programme, but the Mother did not agree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before the protection cases were concluded, however, in November 2022 the Mother filed an application to vary the Order. She did not seek to disturb the orders on custody care and control of the Child, but she sought changes regarding access, as well as to remove a penal notice that had been attached to it. The Father objected to these requests and filed a cross application to vary the care and control of the Child to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 7 December 2022, after 3 days of hearing, the learned District Judge Amy Tung dismissed both the protection applications by the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother’s and Father’s variation applications were then heard by me in May 2023. I heard the parents. I interviewed the Child. In July 2023, I dismissed both applications. The Mother appealed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Pending the hearing of the appeal, in August 2023, the Father applied for 2 weeks of additional access during the end-of-year school holidays in lieu of more than 117 breaches of access, and for the Mother to produce the Child’s passport and personal documents for 15 days of overseas travel as provided for in the Order. Again, I heard both parties and I interviewed the Child. I dismissed the Father’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 27 October 2023, the Father filed the present application for an order of committal against the Mother.

She explains that on a few occasions the Child was unwell, or had contracted COVID, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022. During 28 February – 19 March 2023 the Child was in India with her, and so the Father could not have had access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the rest of the occasions, her position is simply that the Child did not want to see the Father nor to spend overnight with him, and she could not force the Child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother confirms that the Child loved the Father. She claims that the Child has not gotten used to overnight access with the Father, and he still complains about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     She says that the Child is a seeing a counsellor to help him handle his feelings. She adduces a copy of a report by the counsellor. The report shows that the counsellor arrived at some conclusions without having interviewed the Father. I find that this examination of the Child had been conducted without leave of the Court as required under Rule 35 of the Family Justice Rules:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Examination of child with leave of Court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35.—(1)    Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action or proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I therefore placed no reliance on its contents. In any event, the examination of the child was conducted not only without leave of the Court, but without notice to the Father or with his involvement. In any event, I find that the report is of no probative value to the issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I find that of the 117 occasions of breach alleged by the Father, 4 of them took place because the Child was ill, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022, and on 20 October 2022. I find that on those occasions, the Mother had reasonable cause to refuse the access, and therefore she did not breach the Order on those occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Of the remaining 113, the Father had partial access albeit not strictly according to the terms of the Order, on 9 &amp; 18 August 2022, 22 October 2022, 10 &amp; 22 November 2022, and 22 January 2023. I give the benefit of these partial compliances to the Mother, and therefore find that for those occasions she is not liable to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As for the remaining 107 times when the Father did not get access to the Child, I find that the Mother has no reasonable excuse. I do not accept that the blame lays with the Child. It is not disputed that there were no issues with access until suddenly in August 2022. This was when the Mother and the Father had an altercation that resulted in the PPO applications. The circumstances of that altercation was itself caused by the Mother’s refusal to give the Father access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Mother’s defence, that the Child does not want to spend overnight with the Father, does not explain the lack of weekday access that did not include overnighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In cases of access, occasional defaults due to reasons such as scheduling issues is understandable, but the sheer number of times that the access was not given in the present case show that this could not have been the case here. The extended and continuous length of the non-compliance over a period of a year displaces such reasonable excuses. It is irresistible to conclude that the non-compliance was nothing other than intentional and deliberate. I am not convinced that it is solely because the Child refused to see the Father. Throughout the trial, there was little before me to say why the Child would refuse to see his father. More stark is the fact that the Mother did not take steps to address the Child’s alleged reluctance. Even if I were to accept that there was reluctance on the part of the Child, the Mother had refused to have the issue referred to a therapist under the POTS scheme when the opportunity arose during the PPO proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I find it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, that the Mother is guilty of contempt of court in that she did not comply with the Order in a total of 107 times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Mitigation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In mitigation, the Mother’s learned counsel argues that the Child had indicated to the Mother that he did not wish to go for the overnight and overseas access, and that it was not possible to force the Child to go for the access against his wishes. She argues that the Child was no longer small enough to be carried off to access against his will. Therefore, Counsel argues, the Mother had done all that was needed on her part. The Child is of age that he is able to speak what he wants. She argues that as such, the Mother should not be penalised. She suggested that counselling to be ordered so her client can attend instead of committing her for the breaches. Alternatively, she asked for any committal order to be suspended, for the parents to attend counselling on how to deal with the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Father, who represents himself, argues that the breaches were significant. The Mother has not shown any remorse or take responsibility. She has had opportunities to address the issue. The Father agrees to a suspension of committal, but he says he believes that things will not change unless there is a significant risk imposed on the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I note that provision for punishment for contempt of court is found in the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016, in particular, in subsection 12 (c):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Punishment for contempt of court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“12.—(1</em>)     <em>Except as otherwise provided in any other written law, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished —</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the General Division of the High Court in relation to contempt in the face of or in connection with any proceedings in a State Court, Family Court or Youth Court (as the case may be), with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by any other court, with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I take into account that this is the first time that the Mother is guilty of contempt. I take into account that she does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I also take into account that she contested the case against her. I take into account that she does not contest that the Father had not had access to the Child for a year preceding his application. I take into account that the Mother committed these breaches even after her application to vary the terms of access had been dismissed by me, and also by the High Court. I take into account that if indeed the Child was unwilling to see the Father for reasons beyond her control, the Mother had refused to address the issue by accepting therapy under the POTS scheme. These factors weigh against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is in the best interest of every child to have relationships with both parents. Relationships can only be built upon a strong foundation of contact and time spent together. Access orders are issued to meet this goal. It follows that such orders must be carried out. It is the basic duty of parents to ensure that access arrangements are followed through, to and come to mutual adjustments to deal with issues when they arise, but always with the intent to ensure that access is provided, so that the child has full space and time to build and maintain a relationship with the access parent. When there is a difficulty in complying, then it is a parental duty to address it. The Mother had failed to meet this duty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that it is fair and just that the Mother be fined $8,000.00 which is to be paid within 1 month, in default of which she be imprisoned for 4 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I find it appropriate and just to I suspend this Committal Order provided the Mother does not commit any further breach of the 3 December 2019 Order of Court for a period of 1 year. If she fails to comply with the terms on which this Committal Order is suspended, the Father shall be at liberty to apply inter partes to the Court to consider whether the Committal Order should be enforced or discharged [<em>Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0870.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 870</a></em>].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I urge the Mother to come to arrangements with the Father and with the Child to undergo therapy to address the access issues. With sincerity and effort, I hope the Child will enjoy a happy and positive relationship with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On costs, the Mother says that she is not able to pay any costs. She had not paid costs for the appeal. She does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father argues that the case had been going on 12 months. He had to serve a penal notice, file a leave application, filed 3 affidavits, attend case conferences, and several hearings. He sought $25,000 as costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As an order of costs follow the event, so the Father is entitled to costs. However, he is a litigant acting in person and did not incur lawyers’ fees. I order that the Mother pay costs to the Father in the fixed sum of $1,000.00, with disbursements to be agreed to or taxed.</p> </div></content></root>"}]
