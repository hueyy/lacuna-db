The parties had agreed to all financial matters (including maintenance), and had settled on joint custody by the time of the hearing. Both parties sought sole care and control of the child, with the Mother in particular resisting any overnight or overseas access by the Defendant Father on account of his alleged addiction to alcohol, gaming and pornography, as well as perceived inadequacies in his ability to care for the child. At the court’s behest, the Father underwent psychological assessment, which eventually ruled out safety concerns from alcohol consumption. I granted the Mother sole care and control as she has been the primary caregiver, and granted the Father one session of weekend overnight access and two sessions of weekday access, with overseas travel to be allowed from the age of six years. Additional safeguards and conditions were also imposed to address the Mother’s residual concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed this appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father and Mother married on 24 October 2014. The marriage lasted about nine years. Their daughter arrived on 9 May 2020, and they moved into their matrimonial home in December 2021, after which the relationship progressively broke down. Interim judgment was granted on 9 November 2023 by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of the hearing, the parties still resided together in their matrimonial home, although the Father had moved out of the master bedroom since the breakdown of the marriage in late September 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. They still managed to co-parent and exercised shared care over the child, with the Mother having private time with the child on Saturdays and the Father on Sundays. They had also agreed that each would have access to the child on alternating public holidays<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Both parents are working full-time. The Father’s job affords flexibility to work-from-home, whereas the Mother has to work full-time from the office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A total of 14 affidavits were filed in the present matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The parties each filed two Affidavits of Assets and Means (“AOM”), with leave granted for both to file a supplementary affidavit with regard to the Father’s alleged drinking habits during the observation period with the psychologist. The parties’ six affidavits are marked as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“MA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s 1st AOM filed on 13 December 2023 (“FA-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“MA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AOM filed on 14 February 2024 (“FA-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 3 July 2024 (“MA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 10 July 2024 (“FA-3”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, both parties sought to bolster their cases with affidavits filed by their immediate family:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Paternal Grandmother, KBL, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGM-1” and “PGM-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Paternal Grandfather, LKH, filed two affidavits, on 13 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PGF-1” and “PGF-2” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Paternal Uncle, LHB, filed two affidavits, on 14 December 2023 and 14 February 2024 (“PU-1” and “PU-1” respectively)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother’s eldest sister, CWCY, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-1”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Mother’s younger sister, JWQL, filed an affidavit on 14 February 2024 (“MS-2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first heard parties on 11 April 2024. Given the safety concerns raised by the Mother about the Father’s alleged addiction to alcohol, I suggested and the Father agreed to attend before a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme to assess whether such concerns were founded. The psychologist was directed to tender a report thereafter, which would be open to the parties. I gave the Mother the liberty to file a supplementary affidavit restricted solely to her observations on the Father’s drinking habits from that point forward, and for the Father to have a right to reply. I also directed that no further audio or video recordings were to be made during this period, save for any incidents of loss of control due to the alleged intake of alcohol, and for parties to abstain from disparaging each other in the presence of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the next hearing on 15 July 2024, parties made further oral submissions of the psychologist’s report and their supplementary affidavits. I rendered decision with brief grounds at the hearing. Parties subsequently wrote in with further clarifications, and after a third hearing on 23 August 2024 (“the clarificatory hearing”), adjustments were made to some of the access orders. I gave leave for the time for appeal to run from this latest hearing, and the Father filed his appeal on 5 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s position was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She should have sole care and control to the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father should have daytime access only until the child reached the age of 12 or after her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), whichever is the later, and with overnight and/or overseas access to commence thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For ease of exposition, I have grouped the Mother’s arguments under eight broad headings as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Preservation of Status Quo.</b> The Mother claims she has been the primary caregiver since the child’s birth, and has maintained sole care and control over the child since the commencement of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, with the Father effectively having only daytime access to the child. Apart from a change in the residence expected in November 2024 when the matrimonial home would be sold, there would be no material change to the child’s life if she was under the Mother’s sole care, as the Mother would continue to oversee her usual schooling, enrichment and weekend routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The Mother therefore submits that sole care under her would best preserve the current status quo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Young child best placed in Mother’s care</b>. The Mother argues that a young child at the tender age of four would typically be dependent on the Mother for her welfare and psychological needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Mother has a sound parenting plan and has secondary care arrangements.</b> The Mother submits that her handling of the daily routines with the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> render her best placed to take into consideration all aspects of her well-being. The Mother’s preliminary plan is to move into her family home in Punggol, where the child has spent significant time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, has an established space for herself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, and where the Mother’s two sisters are able to provide active support if needed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The Mother has also taken care to encourage the child’s holistic development, enrolling her in Sunday school at their Church, and also enrolling her for Chinese enrichment classes. In contrast, the Mother points out that the Father’s proposed parenting plan is premised on a heavy reliance on his aged parents and brother, whose family does not have as much recent contact with the child. She claims he has never independently cared for the child overnight on his own, being relatively uninvolved in her life so far<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. She also takes the view that the Father’s interest are on his own needs and questions his commitment to caring for the child, as borne out in his messages to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Denial of allegations of alienation and abrasive parenting.</b> The Mother denies the Father’s allegations that she exercises abrasive parenting, claiming that he had taken conversations between the Mother and the child out of context<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also denies alienation on her part, pointing out that the child has not demonstrated any reluctance to spending time with the Father or his family during his weekend access time. In fact, the Mother points out that she has been taking a Therapeutic Justice approach despite the acrimonious relationship between the parties, continuing to stay in the matrimonial home and co-parenting for the sake of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <b>Lax and Hands-off Parenting.</b> According to the Mother, the Father has all along been uninvolved in the child’s daily life, and handles the child with a hands-off parenting approach, choosing to occupy the Child with the iPad or the television, instead of engaging her in more healthy activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also claims the Father exercises a laxer standard of parenting, being overly permissive of the child’s behaviour, and being unaware that the child needs boundaries and discipline at her young age<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. She submits that it would not be in the child’s interest to have such double standards in parenting at a young age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <b>Concern about the Father’s alcoholic addiction.</b> The Mother’s primary concern is the child’s safety and wellbeing during the Father’s access while she is at a tender age. She documented incidents where the Father had demonstrated a clear lack of control over his emotions and behaviour due to excessive drinking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>, and claimed that he is incapable of sober supervision over the child when he indulges himself. According to the Mother, the Father would drink multiple times a week to excess, both at home and externally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and would go on drinking sessions with his friends at least two to three times a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. When drinking at home, she observed that he would start with beer, progressing to wine and thereafter hard liquor over the course of the night, making excessive noise until he falls asleep or passes out late in the night<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. On occasions when he drank to excess, the Mother claimed that the Father was unable to coordinate his movements, and would often barge into the bedroom while inebriated to check on the child or to kiss or hug the child who was already asleep<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She also claimed he becomes aggressive and would slam things in the house whilst drunk, resulting to an incident on 22 July 2022 when she called the police<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, as well as an earlier incident on 31 December 2020 when the Father returned home in a drunk and agitated state and tried to snatch the child from her, which caused her to leave the home to stay with her sister<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Due to his drinking habits, the Mother views him as an unsafe and inappropriate caregiver for the child. She highlights for example that on 8 May 2022, she found the child sipping from an open can of beer on the Father’s study table which he had left unattended<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <b>Concern about the Father’s pornography addiction.</b> The Mother expresses concern about the Father’s addiction to pornography and his masturbatory habits. She exhibited photographs of his sex paraphernalia in a drawer and suggestive figurines which were left in accessible locations, and expressed her concern on the impact on the child should she come to view these items<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_h\"></a>(h)      <b>Concern about the Father’s gaming habits.</b> The Mother alleges that the Father spends excessive time gaming on a console connected to the living room television, in full view of the entire household. She observes that he plays games rated for “mature” audiences, which may contain graphic violence, gore, sex and nudity, as well as profanity<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On the Father’s part, he sought sole care and control of the child, or in the alternative, at least shared care and control with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I briefly summarise the Father’s arguments as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Active and hands-on father.</b> The Father claims he has been actively involved in the child’s care, including bathing, feeding, cleaning her, taking her to swimming lessons, medical and specialist appointments, as well as playing with and teaching her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. By his account, he has attended all parent-teacher conferences as well as other major activities at her pre-school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, picks her up from pre-school and communicates directly with her teachers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. He also points out that he has flexible work-from-home arrangements, allowing him to work from home most of the time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>, as compared to the Mother who is a full-time office worker, and has to outsource the child’s daytime care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>The Mother’s parenting is not in the child’s best interests.</b> The Father points to instances of what he calls aggressive parenting on the part of the Mother, for example, shouting and screaming at the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, or even confining her on one occasion when the child failed to finish her food<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. On another instance, he described how the Mother had pinned the child on the bed, and thereafter heard two slaps which he suspected were the Mother slapping the child twice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> (the Mother’s version was that the child had hit her twice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>). On 14 October 2023, the Father heard what he believed were the sounds of the Mother hitting the child, and the child repeatedly asking the Mother to say sorry to her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, although the Mother’s explanation was that it was the child who was throwing a tantrum and hitting her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Father also claims that the Mother has a tendency to taunt the child when she is misbehaving<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, which only makes the child more confused and distressed. He also disagrees with the Mother’s practice of imposing long time-outs as a punishment to correct the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Only the Father is committed to safeguarding the relationship with the other parent.</b> The Father claims that while he is committed to ensuring that the child maintains a close relationship with her Mother, he believes that the Mother would seek to diminish his relationship with the child. He raises several points in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       First, in his view, the Mother has sought to restrict his bonding time with the child, by bringing her into the master bedroom to take her morning milk<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, offering the child to watch an iPad in the master bedroom instead of interacting with the Father outside, and taking her into the master bedroom after school and shutting the door<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, thereby denying the Father the chance to partake in the child’s night time routine. He also points out that the Mother takes the child out for the entire Sunday instead of spending the weekend together<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The Father also alleged that the Mother would question the child repeatedly after she had spent time with the Father and nitpick about how he looked after the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Second, the Father claims the Mother excludes him from important decisions concerning the child, such as enrolment in pre-school, enrichment classes and applying for a passport<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Third, he claims the Mother discourages bonding between father and child by making sarcastic and disparaging remarks on his efforts, for example when he reads bedtime stories to the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> or buys toys for the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, or interrupting them when they were watching television<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> or reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. He also finds bizarre her view that his giving of hugs and kisses to the child might eventually be considered inappropriate<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Fourth, he claims the Mother has on various occasions badmouthed him in the child’s presence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In contrast, the Father claims that there are multiple instances where he corrects the child for bad behaviour toward the Mother, such as when the child hit the mother, scratched the mother, bit the Mother, clawed the Mother, and poked the Mother in the eye<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. In 2023, the Father had even bought a birthday gift for the child to pass to her Mother, and reminded her to wish the Mother a happy birthday<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>The Mother falsely paints the Father as violent and a pornography addict.</b> The Father claims the Mother falsely alleges that he has committed domestic violence. For example, he cites that her allegation that he had physically forced the child to brush her teeth was not borne out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>, and points out that her police report on 22 July 2022 alleging that he had committed domestic violence toward her was false, as she had declined to undergo a medical examination and no further action was taken by the police. Next, he claims the Mother relied on false evidence to portray him as a pornography addict, by alleging that he left his sex paraphernalia in easily accessible locations<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. The Father claimed that these items were stored in a locked drawer and that she had unlocked the drawer in order to take photographs of the paraphernalia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <b>The Father has a strong familial support network compared to the Mother.</b> According to the Father, prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the paternal grandparents would drop off groceries for the child, visit at the matrimonial home on Friday and Sunday evenings and on an ad-hoc basis, and pick the child from her pre-school daily<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. This interaction was only stopped at the Mother’s request around September to October 2022, with the paternal grandparents seeing the child on Sunday evenings during the Father’s access time. The Father adds that the child is familiar with her paternal uncle and aunt (his brother)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, joining them for outings and occasionally being fetched from pre-school by her aunt. Given the Father’s intention to live with the child at his parents’ residence, where two bedrooms have been earmarked for the child and himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>, he submits that the living arrangement in his parents’ house would foster bonds within the larger family and provide additional support for the child. The Father also points out that it may not be appropriate for the Mother to rely on her two sisters for the care of the child, given that the elder sister is a habitual smoker and has an older romantic partner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <b>The Father is receptive of feedback and the Mother’s parenting concerns.</b> The Father claims that since the birth of the child, he has materially cut down his alcohol consumption and effectively stopped smoking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. He disputes the Mother’s claims that he continued his lifestyle of drinking and hanging out with his friends to the wee hours of the morning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. He also claims to have drastically cut down the time he spends playing video games<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, denies that he is addicted to gaming, and assures he would not expose the child to any inappropriate video game content<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. In any case, the Father was willing to propose a mutual undertaking that (1) there would be no consumption of alcohol in the child’s presence, (2) any sex paraphernalia would be kept out of sight from the child, (3) there would be no playing of inappropriate video games in the child’s presence, and (4) that no family violence would be committed against the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the alternative, the Father submits that if the Court is not minded to grant him sole care and control, he would request for shared care and control. He argues that it would be in the best interest of a young child to have the benefit of care from two loving parents, ensuring that both parents would fully engage in the child’s care without excluding the other. The Father points out that even after the breakdown of the marriage, the living arrangements were akin to shared care and control, and it would be in the best interests of the child to preserve the status quo in their living arrangements (see <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> [F2BOA Tab 26]). In particular, on weekday mornings, the Father would participate in the child’s morning routine, after the Mother takes her to pre-school. Upon the child’s return, the parties would take turns to care for the child, including bathing her, playing with her and reading bedtime stories<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>. On weekends, while the child is at home in the morning or after dinner at night, both parties would take turn to care for her and participate in her bedtime routines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, the Father points out that this is not a case where the parties hold intractable hostility against each other, as they could continue to live together and managed to agree on the reasons for divorce as well as the financial issues in the Ancillary Matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Should the Father fail to obtain sole or shared care, he proposes access over two weekdays, with an additional weekday when the child turns six years of age. He also took the view that he should be granted weekend overnight access immediately when parties move out of the matrimonial home. He reiterates he is a hands-on and involved parent, and has drastically reduced his alcohol consumption and intends to be in good health so he can provide for his child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. In any event, even if the Mother still had concerns, overnight access would take place in the paternal grandparents’ residence where there were additional hands to support the Father as needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father also submitted for half of school holiday access, and for overseas access to commence immediately, with permission to take two short trips of up to seven days each year. After entering primary school, he wishes to have overseas access during his half of the school holidays, subject to the usual orders in relation to the provision of travel itinerary, accommodation and flight details, contact numbers and the handing over of the passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allegations of Alcohol, Pornography and Gaming Addictions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The primary objection that the Mother raised against the Father’s care was her view that his alleged addictions presented a safety threat to the child. While I appreciated the Mother’s protective instincts in relation to the child, I will explain why I did not find sufficient evidence of safety risks that would justify a restriction of only daytime access between the Father and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To address the concern about alcoholic addiction, at the suggestion of the Court, the Father voluntarily underwent a series of sessions with a psychologist appointed under the Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme. Dr Matthew Woo, a private psychologist of 20 years’ experience who was previously the lead psychologist at the Department of Forensic Psychiatry under the Institute of Mental Health, saw the Father over seven sessions from 26 April 2024 to 21 June 2024 (“the observation period”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In Dr Woo’s report dated 15 July 204, he noted that the Father admitted that he consumed alcohol an average of three times a week, with two to three glasses of alcohol per session, over the previous three years. Dr Woo noted that this was at the borderline of the minimum criteria set by the Health Promotion Board of no more than two standard drinks a day for men. Crucially, Dr Woo observed that over the observation period, the Father had not shown any signs of alcohol use, let alone alcohol dependence. He noted that the Father had taken alcohol-free beer as a substitute for alcohol, and attained very healthy breath analyser readings of 0.000% BAC in his self-conducted tests after psychological treatment began on 26 April 2024. In the course of therapy, the Father had reported four trigger situations which would give him the urge to drink alcohol, namely taking meals which included sashimi, salmon or cheese, as well as stressful situations at the workplace which would give him headaches. Dr Woo shared that these urges were processed with Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR), and noted the Father’s persistence in reducing or desensitising his urges to drink to a zero rating for these triggers. At the end of the observation period, Dr Woo therefore concluded that the Father’s behaviour at home was not under any influence of alcohol, and that there “is simply no evidence of safety issues with respect to child custody”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In her supplementary affidavit, the Mother nevertheless expressed the view that the Father’s dependency on non-alcoholic substitute drinks belied his persistent emotional association with alcohol, and opined that he may not be able to resist such cravings beyond the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. She also voiced her suspicion that the Father had disposed of glass bottles and cans furtively in the night, and suggests that he could have consumed alcohol outside of the home on the 14 nights during the observation period where was either staying at his parents’ home or on an overseas trip<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>. She also notes that the Father had repeatedly attempted to moderate his drinking throughout the marriage, but would fail and lapse into uncontrollable alcoholic binges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>. She thus had serious doubts about the sustainability of his efforts during the observation period, and feared that once the scrutiny of court proceedings was over, he would revert to his long-held drinking habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In his supplementary affidavit, the Father explained that after the first hearing on 11 April 2024, he had disposed of whatever alcohol was in the home and had turned off his wine chiller. He had also started taking frequent breathalyser tests with accompanying video footage, the results of which showed he had zero alcohol content on his breath<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. He submitted that his switch to non-alcoholic beers was testament to his determination to change his behaviour, and he denied the Mother’s accusations that he was hiding his drinking habits during the observation period<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     On balance, I accepted Dr Woo’s opinion that the Father had not shown signs of alcohol consumption, and certainly did not present any safety risk over the course of the observation period. The Mother’s doubts as to whether the Father was still consuming alcohol over this period are speculatory and I am unable to ascribe weight to her views. As to whether there may be safety risks that may arise after the scrutiny of therapy and court proceedings is over, I do note that even when the Father had drunk to excess in the past and exhibited allegedly aggressive behaviour at home, there was never any proof that such aggression was directed against the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     To allay this residual concern on the Mother’s part, I directed that the Father take a breath analyser test before each session of access for the next six months and to preserve a photo record of such test results with the appropriate date and time stamp. These records need not be shared with the Mother and should be retained by the Father for a further six months from the point of the test. The purpose of this procedure is to assure parties that in the event of any future incident or further court proceeding, these records may be made available as evidence. This was intended to provide practical deterrence to ensure the Father abstains from alcohol, without presenting an unreasonable imposition on his privacy and dignity. With the Father’s recent efforts and this practical safeguard in place, I did not think the issue of his past alcoholic consumption would detract from his ability to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Turning to the concern about the Father’s possession of sexual paraphernalia, I note that there was no actual incident where the child had been exposed to the Father’s collection of objects. There was also no suggestion that the Father had behaved inappropriately in any way with his daughter. With regard to the Mother’s expressed concern about the Father hugging and kissing the child, I did not find these to be anything other than normal expressions of parental love towards a young child. I accordingly think that an undertaking as proposed by the father to keep any sexual paraphernalia away from the view of the child would sufficiently address the Mother’s concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, on the issue of gaming addiction, I likewise took the view that an undertaking that no age-inappropriate gaming would take place in the presence of the child would address this concern. The Father would be well aware that any breach of this undertaking would be easily shared by the child with the Mother, which should provide sufficient deterrence against such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For these reasons, I did not find the allegations relating to various addictions to be sufficient cause to restrict the Father to only daytime access with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Sole Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I turn next to the opposing positions on which parent should be granted sole care and control over the child. It is axiomatic that when exercising the power under s 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to place the child in the care and control of either or both parents, the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child (per s 125(2)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is also trite that where all factors are equal between the parties, greater weight is ascribed to the maternal bond between a mother and an infant child. In the oft-cited case of <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>, the Court of Appeal held, in regard to a four-year old child, that a child at a tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs, at [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All other things being equal, a very important factor to bear in mind was that we were dealing with an extremely young infant. We felt that the maternal bond between the appellant and the infant was a pivotal consideration here. The bond between the natural mother and her child is one of the most unexplainable wonders of human nature. It should never be taken for granted or slighted…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In <em>Chan Kah Cheong Kenneth v Teoh Kheng Yau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 2 SLR(R) 0595.xml')\">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 595</a>, MPH Rubin J held that, if all the factors were equal between the parties, then probably it was right for a child of tender years to be brought up by his natural mother. We should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. It is only a natural conclusion that, by reason of his very tender, young age, the infant would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The significance of the maternal bond was earlier highlighted as a relevant factor in determining the issue of care and control in <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>, where the Court of Appeal held at [22] and [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22.    We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these: (a) the conduct of the parties; (b) the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion; <b>(c) a young child would be best looked after by its mother</b>; (d) which party can offer better security and stability; and (e) that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The significant weight to be given to the maternal bond is bolstered in this case by the fact that the Mother has been and remains the primary caregiver of the child. While the Father has made effort to participate actively in the child’s daily routine, it is clear that he is not the parent in charge of the child’s daily welfare. The notion of primary caregiving is not just one of effort or contribution, but rather which parent places the greatest time, energy and priority of the child over and above his or her own personal needs. There is no doubt in my mind that the Mother places the greatest priority on and has the closer bond with the child, and ranks the welfare and developmental needs of the child above her own. Coupled with the importance of preserving the maternal bond for a young child, this factor clearly shifts the issue of sole care in the Mother’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The next factor I considered in deciding the issue of care and control is which party offers better stability and security for the child. Both residential arrangements put forth by the parents, i.e. the Mother’s family home and the home of the paternal grandparents, provide familiarity and continuity to the child. Both households also have family members able to support and step in to assist with the management of the child. Despite certain aspersions cast against each parents’ family members, I did not find there to be any negative factors which militated against the choice of either household. Accordingly, I considered this to be an equally balanced factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I turn next to parenting style and capability. Much ink has been spilled in a running diatribe between the parties on how the other’s parenting techniques are deficient or even dangerous. Such disagreements are not uncommon even in healthy marriages, where fathers are sometimes perceived to be overly permissive, hands-off and insufficiently attentive, while mothers are critiqued for being overly strict, over-protective or overbearing in relation to the upbringing of the child. I say this not to trivialise the validity of such differences of opinion, but to highlight that differing parenting methods and approaches are par for the course, and that it is incumbent for parties to come to terms on a course best suited to the particular characteristics of their child. By all accounts, the child in this case does appear to have some issues with discipline, and acts out against the controlling parent when she does not get her way. While the Father critiques the Mother for being high-handed in disciplining the child, the reality is that parenting can be exasperating even for the most temperate of parents, and I did not find that the Mother had reacted out of line whenever the child acted up against her. On the other hand, I did not agree with the Mother that the Father’s permissive parenting style was necessarily deficient. In truth, a combination of differing parenting styles may be workable and even beneficial in the co-parenting process. It is not uncommon that a child abides by the disciplinary parent and seeks levity and respite with the relaxed parent. Accordingly, despite the minutiae of criticisms levied between the parties, I did not find either parenting style to be detrimental to the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As for parenting capability, it is clear in my view that the Mother is more involved and committed to the care of the child than the Father, having been the primary caregiver since the birth of the child. While the Father has contributed significantly to and has been actively involved in the child’s care, he has never been <em>solely</em> responsible for the child’s welfare for protracted periods of time. In this regard it is clear that the Mother is the far stronger candidate for sole care and control as compared to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, the Father also argued that care should devolve to him due to significant gatekeeping behaviour on the part of the Mother, which would undermine the viability of any terms of access. While it is true that care and control may go to the parent who was more facilitative and reasonable about access (per <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> at [45]), I did not find the Mother guilty of alienation or gatekeeping in any true sense of the word. Quite to the contrary, the very fact that the Mother continued to stay in the matrimonial home until it was sold, and was willing to allow the Father a full day of weekend access to the child in the interim, was telling of her willingness to cooperate with the Father for the sake of the child. This factor was accordingly not helpful to the Father’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Having considered all the above factors, I was of the view that the decision on sole care and control should weigh heavily in favour of the Mother, given the significance of the maternal bond and her role as the primary caregiver of the child since birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Before coming to a final decision, I also considered the Father’s alternative proposition for shared care and control. In considering whether an order for shared care and control would be in the best interest of the child, the court would consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind her age and personality, to live in two homes (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father points out that the parties are able to effectively co-parent at present, and that shared care would essentially be a preservation of the status quo, which would in the usual circumstance be the best choice for preserving the stability of the welfare of the child (per <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, at [34]). However, I would point out that the current arrangement where the child lives with both parents cannot be continued because the matrimonial home is due for sale. A regime of shared care would therefore not be a preservation of the status quo. With shared care, the child would need to transition to an arrangement where she spent equal time between two homes, one in Punggol and the other in River Valley. She would also have to alternate between two different extended families, with wholly different parenting values, habits and expectations, which may only diverge more markedly over time as the parents lead their separate lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While it is true that a young child who has yet to commence formal education may be more suited to a shared care and control arrangement (per <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [109], and <em>UPK v UPL <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22321-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 92</a></em> at [26]), the reality is that it would be a significant adjustment for the child to spend equal time between two extended families which would have equal control and influence over her life. I am not convinced how this would be beneficial rather than disruptive to the child’s life. On the other hand, maintaining the Mother as the sole caregiver would provide a measure of stability and security to the child that would mitigate the disruption brought about by the divorce. The child would still preserve her bond with her Father if sufficient latitude is given to him for access. I therefore declined to order shared care and control as proposed by the Father, and granted the Mother sole care and control over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overnight Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given my earlier reasoning that the Mother’s concerns of safety regarding the Father’s alleged addictions was not borne out, I did not find any reason to deny the Father overnight access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Indeed, the Court should be slow to deny a parent overnight access, given the benefits that extended access brings to the development of the parent-child bond (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [29]-[30]). I note too that the age of the child in itself is not a strong reason for allowing or denying the other parent overnight access (see <b><em>BKJ v BKK</em></b> at [32]). The importance of overnight access was succinctly explained by District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang in <b><em>VZP v VZQ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27068-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 8</a> at [25] in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Child should be equally entitled to overnight access with the father as he is with the mother, unless there is evidence to disprove either party’s eligibility, such as a history of abusive or negligent parenting. Even though the Children are asleep during a part of the overnight access, there is an intangible value of building up familiarity, being able to say good morning to or to have a particular storybook read by the parent before the Children go to bed, these are important opportunities to build bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I was therefore minded to allow one session of overnight weekend access to the Father each week, from 9 pm on Saturday to 9 pm on Sunday. This would enable both parents to have an equal share of weekend time, while ensuring that the child returned home with sufficient leeway to settle down before the weekday routine began.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     To ensure that the child receives the best care possible, and also mindful that the Father has not been in sole care of the child for an extended period of time, I added the condition that the child is to reside at the home of the Father’s parents during such overnight access, as their support would be especially helpful in the management of a child at a tender age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the clarificatory hearing, the Father requested for the Mother to drop off the child for his weekend access on Saturday 9 pm at the paternal grandparents’ house in River Valley. The Mother objected as her routine involved attending church at Suntec City in the evening followed by dinner nearby from 7.30 pm to 8.30 pm, which would either be at the same location or near Raffles City or Dhoby Ghaut MRT. As the Mother did not drive, it would be difficult for her to send the child to River Valley thereafter. Given that the Father drives and for the benefit of the young child’s welfare, I directed that the child be picked up for handover at Suntec City (save where there are road closures in any part of town), Dhoby Ghaut MRT or Raffles City, and for the Mother to inform the Father of the exact location at least one hour beforehand. The Mother then sought the limitation that the pickup be done by the Father alone, as the grandparents were elderly and may be unable to handle the child’s temper tantrums. I did not think it necessary to impose this limitation on the Father, when there was no evidence of inability to manage the child on the part of the paternal grandparents. I did however refine the direction to specify that the pickup of the child should be restricted to immediate family members only (i.e. excluding a domestic helper or some other third party), given the young age of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Finally, to forestall future disputes regarding the use of weekend time for external activities, I directed that the allocation of time for co-curricular and enrichment activities should fall equally between each parent’s period of weekend access, with any excess allocation to be subject to agreement by both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overnight Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Turning to weekday access, I granted the Father access to the child over two weekday evenings on Wednesday and Thursday, from the time the child is picked up from childcare or school to 8:30 pm. At the clarificatory hearing, the Mother requested for a change of days to Tuesday and Thursday, as she wished to undertake volunteering activities for the purposes of future primary school application on Tuesday. The Father objected to this as he would be tied up with work on Tuesday. As the Father’s commitment appeared more immutable, I declined the Mother’s request to amend the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, to afford flexibility, I directed that should access not be practicable on any given session, the Father should in the alternative be granted video access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     As agreed by parties, the sessions of access would also be subject to the undertakings of both parties not to consume alcohol, play age-inappropriate video games or expose the child to any sexually inappropriate objects during the period of care over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Overseas Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As for overseas access, I repeat my earlier observation that the Father had hitherto not taken sole charge of the child for a protracted period of time. I was of the view that overseas access should be introduced in a staggered fashion, with a requirement of accompaniment by either the paternal grandparents or the paternal aunt from the age of six to nine years of age. After the age of nine years, the Father should be able to take the child for overseas access alone, as the child would be more mature and the Father would have more experienced in the exclusive care of the child. Accordingly, the following directions were made regarding overseas access by the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Overseas access with the Father commences when the child reaches 6 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such access should be for no more than 7 days at a time, and shall not exceed two times a year without the consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any overseas access should also be in the company of either parent of the Father or the sister-in-law of the Father, until the child reaches the age of 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The exact dates of such overseas access should be notified no less than one month in advance to the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The passport of the child is to be handed over seven days before the commencement of travel and returned seven days after the conclusion of travel. At the clarificatory hearing, an additional condition was added that neither party should withhold consent to renew the passport without reasonable cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Each parent should have daily video access to the child when the child is travelling with the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_g\"></a>(g)     For the avoidance of doubt, overseas trips take priority over regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father also sought clarification whether a staycation would be allowed for his overnight access prior to the child turning six years of age. Mindful that overnight access was ordered to be at the paternal grandparent’s residence to ensure that the Father was well-supported while the child was young, I declined to allow staycations prior to the age of six years old. I would however leave it to parties to exercise reason within the spirit of the order, for e.g. if the paternal grandparents were to join the overnight staycation, I would not see any reason why such a variation should not be acceded to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other Access Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With regard to school holidays, a similar stepped-up approach was applied. Once the child commences primary school, the Father would have additional daytime access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, with the school holidays equally shared once the child turns nine years of age. This accords with the earlier reasoning that the Father should enjoy greater access once there was greater familiarity over the child’s care, at an age when the child is more mature and independent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The following is a summary of the orders made regarding public and school holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Public holiday access is to alternate between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During school holidays when the child commences primary school, the Father shall additionally have access on Weds and Thurs from 10 am to 8.30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the child turns nine years of age, school holiday access is to be equally shared (which will include overnight access). The Father will be granted access for the first half of any school holiday in the first and odd years of every calendar year, and will be granted the second half of the school holiday in even years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties suggested that there be video call access every other evening from 5.30 to 6.00 pm during uninterrupted periods of access. I agreed and so directed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For each parent’s birthday, as well as Mother’s and Father’s Day, the respective parent would have access from 10 am to 8.30 pm, and this would supersede any other direction on regular access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On the child’s birthday access, the parent without access on that day would be granted two hours of access with the child, with the exact hours of access to be agreed between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_g\"></a>(g)     At the clarificatory hearing, parties also agreed that if for any reason a period of access would fall under one hour, there would be no need for the other parent to hand over the child for this short period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On the issue of costs, I considered that while both sides did not fully prevail in their arguments before the Court, the final outcome was more aligned with what counsel revealed to be the Father’s without prejudice offer. Accordingly, I directed that costs of $1,500 (all-in) be paid by the Mother to the Father.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\"

The basis of their application was on Section 5(1)(d)(i) and Section 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA, that the Child has been, or is at risk of being ill-treated by the Father and that the Child behaves in a manner that is, or is likely to be, harmful to herself and the Father is unwilling to take necessary measures to remedy the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Social Report hearing was fixed on 9 May 2022, and CPS had recommended for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely her paternal grandparents, Mr C and Mdm D (“the paternal grandparents”), for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months. Besides the grounds set out in paragraph 4 above, CPS had added an additional ground in the social report, under Section 5(1)(g), that the Child was likely to suffer from emotional harm due to emotional or psychological abuse by the Father. The Mother had agreed to CPS’s recommendations on 5 May 2022. The Father disagreed with the recommendations and so the Court had fixed the matter for a Family Conference to allow a Family Court Specialist to facilitate the conversation between CPS and the Father and to address the Father’s concerns. After the Family Conference on 31 May 2022, the matter was resolved as CPS and the Father agreed for the Child to be placed under a statutory supervision order, under the care of the paternal grandparents for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the review hearing on 30 December 2022, CPS had recommended for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely, the paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months as they were of the view that the Child continues to be in need of care and protection. The Father contested the recommendations. The matter was fixed for hearing on 6 July 2023 before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After hearing the matter on 6 July 2023, I had directed for a child interview on 4 August 2023 to be arranged for me to speak to the Child to ascertain her views, with the support of a Family Court Specialist, as she was already 14 years old and would be mature enough to express her views about her living arrangements and her relationship with her Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After considering the Child’s views at the interview (which remained confidential) and the parties’ submissions, I had ordered, on 30 August 2023, for the Child to be placed under the statutory supervision of the Approved Welfare Officer, under the care of her paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months (“the August 2023 orders”). I had also expressed to parties at the hearing that the August 2023 orders will give time for professionals to help mend the Father-daughter relationship and that CPS should work with the Father towards the ultimate goal of reintegration to the Father, as the Father continues to receive services from the professionals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Current Application for Review and CPS’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       CPS had subsequently requested for a review hearing on 30 August 2024 (“the Review Hearing”). The Child is now 15 years old. CPS had recommended for the current order for statutory supervision to be extended for another 12 months. The matter was fixed for a contested hearing on 13 November 2024 (“the 13 November Hearing”) before me as the Father had objected to the recommendations. The Mother did not attend the 13 November Hearing as she had given her consent to the recommendations on 16 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For the 13 November Hearing, CPS had filed 2 affidavits, namely, the Affidavit of CPO Mr E dated 4 October 2024 and the Affidavit of CPO Ms F dated 30 October 2024. CPS had also filed their submissions dated 6 November 2024. The Father had filed 2 affidavits dated 11 September 2024 and 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">CPS’s Position at 13 November Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     CPS submits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> that there has been no material change in circumstances since the August 2023 orders and that the Child remains in need of care and protection under section 5(1)(g) read with sections 5(2)(a) of the CYPA. CPS is of the view that the Child has suffered and continues to be likely to suffer from emotional harm because she has been subjected to emotional and psychological abuse by the Father, as the Father has subjected the Child to persistent acts of rejection or degradation that are harmful to her well-being or sense of self-worth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     CPS contends that there remains a significant risk that the Father may subject the Child to further acts of emotional or psychological abuse if she is returned to his care at this stage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, which is shown by the Father’s confrontational behaviour during the access sessions between the Child and him, as well as the Father’s persistent acts of exposing the Child’s identity online.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     CPS has informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> the Court that two of the six access sessions (on 27 February 2024 and 26 March 2024) had to be terminated early at the Child’s request. CPS has added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> that since the August 2023 orders, the Father had persistently compromised the Child’s well-being by revealing her identity as being subject of CPS’s investigations and of previous care and protection orders, both online and in public<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In particular, the Father had recorded the six access sessions between January and March 2024 without permission and uploaded them on YouTube and/or his website and uploaded a full, unredacted copy of his affidavit filed in previous Youth Court proceedings which contained various references to the Child’s name. The Father had contravened Section 111 of the CYPA by recording and uploading photos of his access sessions with the Child onto social media platforms and was given a 24-months conditional warning by the Police<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     According to CPS, the Child’s “emotions became very unstable, and that she felt nauseous and experienced chest tightness, after [the Child] had learnt of [the Father’s] uploading of videos.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 25 August 2024, it was also brought to CPS’s attention that the Father had uploaded online screenshots of text messages exchange with CPS. The Child could be identified in these messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s position at the 13 November Hearing </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father objected to the recommendations at the Review Hearing and at the 13 November hearing. The Father alleges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that he had “discovered corrupt practices (unmerited/excessive referrals to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) by CPS and bribery arrangements between them, enabled and protected by the Family Justice Courts)”. The Father argues<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> that CPS did not adhere to the principles of the CYPA with a “corrupt intent” so that the Child Protection Order in this matter could be “extended for as long as possible to generate fraudulent counselling fees”. The Father contends that CPS “did nothing to facilitate the reintegration process with a ‘corrupt intent’ to generate fraudulent counselling fees (paid by public monies) for SSAs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father contends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that the existing child protection order was “voided” on 13 March 2024 because CPS “did nothing” to facilitate the reintegration process when the Child agreed to move in and live with him during the access session on 12 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father had submitted at the 13 November Hearing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the existing orders must be discharged and that the Child must return to live with him immediately. The Father had informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Court that he had moved from a 1-room rental flat in Choa Chu Kang to a 3-room flat in Bukit Batok which means he is able to provide a more stable and comfortable home environment for the Child. The Father has stated that the Child’s paternal grandparents currently live in a “short-lease 2 room Flexi flat” where the Child does not have her own room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     When the Court asked the Father at the 13 November Hearing whether he had removed the online content identifying the Child as someone being involved in these Child Protection Proceedings (as directed by the Court by DJ Amy Tung at the Review Hearing), the Father had informed the Court that he did not intend to remove the online content.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     After hearing both parties, I had then decided to direct CPS to arrange for the Child to undergo psychological and/or psychiatric assessment by IMH and for IMH to furnish a copy of the report to the Court and Parents before the next hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In a review of existing care and protection orders, the legal test that is to be applied is as stated at BHR (Natural Mother of B) v Child Protector <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16760-SSP.xml')\">[2014] SGJC 1</a> (“BHR”) at [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…whether there exist any change in circumstances…to warrant/justify the cancellation/rescission [of the Previous Orders]. In this regard [the Court] will have to consider whether the child is still in need of care and protection under [the relevant sections of the CYPA] given the welfare and best interests of the child as of paramount interest.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In the unreported decision of the High Court in Youth Court Appeal No. YA 004 of 2018/01<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, which was an appeal from Child Protector v Parents of GCQ v GCB <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22225-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGYC 4</a> (“GCQ”), Debbie Ong J had opined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> that the Court needed to consider at a review hearing “whether the Parents are now in a different position such that they are sufficiently fit to have the children returned to them”. In determining this, the Court could consider whether the parents have complied with counselling and other interventions, whether they are committed to a safety plan, and whether there have been breaches in safety plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasons for calling for a fresh psychological and/or psychiatric report on the Child from IMH</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Under Section 54(13) of the CYPA, the Court, when deciding what order is to be made, is to treat the welfare of the child or young person as the paramount consideration and is to endeavour to obtain such information as to the family background, general conduct, home environment, school record, medical history and state of development of the child or young person to enable the Court to deal with the case in the best interests of the child or young person. Section 54(14)(d) of the CYPA empowers the Court to require the child or young person to undergo such medical, psychiatric, psychological or other assessment as the Court thinks necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I was of the view that a fresh psychiatric/ psychological assessment of the Child was necessary for me to consider whether she is still in need of care and protection. The report will also help me to find out more about the Child’s current mental and emotional state in order to decide whether the Child is ready to return to live with the Father. In particular, I wanted an objective assessment on whether CPS’s assertion that the Father’s recent actions have added to the Child’s distress and anxiety, resulting in placing her at continued risk of suffering from emotional harm<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, can be substantiated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I did note that the last report by IMH on the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> was dated 24 May 2022, which is more than 2 years ago. In this last report by IMH, the Child was first seen at the Emergency Room on 28 March 2021 after she was brought in by her family for self-harm and suicidal thoughts following a conflict with her family. As stated in the report, there was another instance where the Child was brought back to the Emergency Room on 22 December 2021 by the police for having suicidal thoughts following a scolding by her father. She was once again brought back to the Emergency Room at IMH on 28 March 2022 by the police for self-harm following a scolding by her father. The Psychiatrist, Dr G, was under the impression then that the Child was suffering from Acute Situational Reaction<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Father had acknowledged that the Child has had a history of self-harm “back to 2018” and that she had “committed self-harm under the charge of her non-biological grandparents.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that a fresh assessment would assist the Court in deciding whether the Child still suffers from such self- harm tendencies before I decide whether she is ready to be reintegrated to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I had also wanted to find out how the Child is responding to the access sessions that she has had with the Father, as well as the impact that the Father’s act of revealing her identity online, as someone who is involved in child protection proceedings, would have on her. The Father had, at the 13 November Hearing, argued that he did not think that his act of revealing the Child’s identity online would affect her adversely, and he had explained that his need to “expose corruption” in publishing the videos will “outweigh the side effects”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I did note that there has been a relatively recent Psychological Therapy Report (“PTR”) dated 23 May 2024 prepared by Ms H, Senior Clinical Psychologist of the Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service (“CFPS”)(under MSF), which was presented to the Court attached with the Review Report. However, the PTR was focused on the therapy progress of the Child for the period from 6 January 2023 to 7 July 2023. There was no assessment or information of her current mental and emotional condition, especially after the August 2023 orders or after the recent events in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father has responded in his affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> to the contents of the PTR and had referred to Ms H as a “corrupt psychologist”. In view of the Father’s immense distrust of CFPS and MSF, I was of the view that a report should be obtained from IMH instead of CFPS.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">What are the interim care and protection orders that would be in the best interest and welfare of the Child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The next issue that I had to decide was, what were the interim care and protection orders that would be made while the IMH report was being prepared. I was mindful that we will need to give IMH sufficient time to assess the Child and to prepare the report- and I had therefore adjourned the hearing to 20 February 2025 for me to consider the contents of the report and to make my final orders after that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     CPS had submitted at the 13 November Hearing that the existing orders should be extended while the Father was of the view that the existing orders should be discharged and that the Child should be ordered to return to live with him immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     When I was making my decision on whether to extend the interim orders, I was guided by Section 4(b) of the CYPA, which states that “in all matters relating to the administration or application of this Act, the welfare and best interests of the child or young person must be the first and paramount consideration<em>”.</em> Under Section 54(14)(e), the Court is empowered to adjourn the case for such period as it thinks necessary as an interim order having effect only during the period of the adjournment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It was necessary to extend the existing orders which mandate the Father to immediately take down the relevant website and social media posts, and not to re-publish any of the contents of those posts through any means, including on social media or the Internet and that he shall not publish or broadcast, through any means including on social media or the Internet, anything which directly or indirectly relates to or is the subject of the proceedings before the Youth Court, given his expressed refusal to do so at the 13 November Hearing. The identity of the Child has to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I was of the view it is in the interest of the Child that the status quo should remain in order not to destabilise her and I had therefore extended the existing orders. It is premature for the Court discharge the existing orders without first obtaining the further information that is required from the report to enable the Court to deal with the case in the best interests of the Child. The statutory supervision order, with the Child being under the care of her paternal grandparents, should remain, until the next hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For the above reasons, I made the orders as stated at [2] above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[14] of CPS’s Written Submissions dated 6 November 2024 (“CPS’s Submissions”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>[19] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>[26] of Mr Benjamin Leow’s Affidavit of 4 October 2024 (“BLA”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Page 93 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>[19c] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>[27(g)] of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Page 94 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Page 95 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>[3] of Father’s Affidavit dated 11 September 2024 (“FA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>[10] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>[12] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>[12] of Father’s Affidavit dated 16 October 2024 (“FA2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>[24] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Page 4 of FA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>[13] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Page 11 of the Notes of Argument dated 22 November 2018, at page 50 of CPS’s Bundle of Authorities</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>[29] of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Page 82 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Page 82-83 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Page 8 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>[19] of FA-1</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Application to revoke a personal protection order – Whether the alleged abuse of a personal protection order by a protected person is a ground to revoke the order – Approach where an applicant is alleged to have breached the order","Evidence – Burden of proof – Whether an applicant has proved his case for revoking a personal protection order – Factual findings of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved” under s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893"],"date":"2024-12-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 1031 of 2024","title":"XGG v XGH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 111","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32623-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gurdaib Kumar Singh and Ms Divya Durai (M/s Regal Law LLC) for the Applicant","Respondent in person."],"timestamp":"2024-12-20T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XGG v XGH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGG <em>v</em> XGH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32623-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 111</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The parties are now residing in different households and there has been no recent incident of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Respondent strong denies the Applicant’s allegations and objects to his application. According to the Respondent, the PPO is still necessary for the protection of her son and herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summary of decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the evidence and submissions, I dismiss the application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged abuse of PPO not proved</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with the Applicant’s first reason as to why the PPO ought to be revoked – namely that the Respondent has allegedly “abused” the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Requirement for revocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, it should be noted that the mere fact that a protected person may have “abused” a PPO is not a sufficient basis to revoke the order. This is because the test for revocation is <em>whether a PPO is still necessary</em> to protect that person. To succeed in a revocation application, the applicant must thus prove that he/she “is unlikely” to commit family violence in future: s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). This position is well settled: see e.g., <em>Joycelyn Toh Hui Yu v Toh Siew Luan Bette</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0275.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 275</a> at [17(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     To be clear, the above position does not mean that a protected person can use a PPO as an instrument of oppression. Depending on the circumstances, a person who has been victimised by a protected person can apply for a PPO against the latter. Additionally, the protected person may also be criminally liable, e.g., under s 182 of the Penal Code 1871 if he/she makes a false police report that a PPO has been breached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Allegations of abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In his affidavit, the Applicant referred to several incidents where the Respondent had allegedly “abused” the PPO. During the hearing, he agreed to focus on four of them. I will now address each of these allegations, <em>first</em>, whether the Applicant has proved these four incidents of “abuse”, and <em>second</em>, whether the PPO is no longer necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2 June 2024 incident – Applicant checking on his daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I begin with an incident on 2 June 2024. (This incident occurred just <em>one day before</em> the Applicant filed his application to revoke the PPO.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>) His account of this incident is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On that day at about 2.00 am, while in the carpark, the Applicant noticed that the light in the matrimonial flat’s master-bedroom was switched on. The Applicant decided to check on his daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On entering the flat unit, the Applicant saw that nobody was at home. Anxious at being unable to find his daughter, the Applicant phoned the Respondent to check. The Respondent responded with vulgarities and told him to wait with his girlfriend at the void deck for her to come over. The Applicant made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the Applicant returned to the matrimonial flat, the Respondent refused to let him enter, claiming that she had been advised to do so by the Investigation Officer (“<b>IO</b>”). The Applicant called the IO. The latter denied having given such advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She was in fact at home with her children at the material time. At about 2.39 am, she received a phone call from an unknown woman who screamed and used vulgarities at her. The woman also asked her to go to the void deck. When the Respondent looked over the parapet, she saw the Applicant and another man downstairs. They were walking towards her block in an unsteady manner – apparently under the influence of alcohol.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Soon thereafter, the Applicant was outside the matrimonial flat. He scolded the Respondent and threatened to bash her up. He did not request to speak to the daughter at all material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A few minutes later, the Respondent heard the Applicant shouting from the carpark and asking her to come down. (According to the Respondent, she has a <em>voice recording</em> of this. She however did not tender the recording as evidence because it was not transcribed.) The Applicant stopped shouting on being alerted by his girlfriend and his male companion that the Respondent was recording the incident. The Respondent tendered a video recording of the incident as evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Later, the Applicant, his girlfriend, and his male companion took turns to call the Respondent’s handphone. In these calls, they scolded her and threatened to beat her up. The Respondent hung up the phone and called the Police. During the trial, she tendered her call log to prove that she had received numerous phone calls from the Applicant, his girlfriend and an unidentified number at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Police eventually arrived at the scene. Police officer(s) told the Respondent that the Applicant had been drinking under her block of flats. According to her, the Police could confirm that her daughter was in the flat unit at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Respondent believes that the 2 June incident was triggered by a video that she had posted regarding the Applicant’s girlfriend on 30 May 2024. According to the Respondent, this posting irritated the Applicant. Since then, he had started to threaten her over the phone. Before posting the video, the Applicant was fine. The Respondent understands from the IO that the police investigations into the 2 June incident have been completed, and that the matter is now with the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I find that the Applicant has “not proved” his case regarding the 2 June incident on a balance of probabilities. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is unusual that a right-thinking father would choose to visit his eight-year-old daughter in the middle of the night <em>at 2.00 am</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is an <em>inexplicable gap</em> in the Applicant’s evidence. Based on his account, he had gone to the matrimonial flat twice. On the first occasion, he had entered the flat unit and found that no one was at home. On the second occasion, the Respondent was in the flat unit and refused to let him enter. The duration between these two occasions would have been brief. Based on the Applicant’s evidence, the Respondent had mysteriously turned up at the unit. (This is despite she having told him to wait at the void deck for her.) The Applicant did not explain how this was possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, I find the Respondent’s evidence that she and her children were resting at home at about 2.00 am to be inherently more credible. Furthermore, her evidence that the Applicant, his girlfriend, and another man had called her phone at the material time is also supported by her call log.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     For clarity, in coming to the finding in [15(c)], I did not rely on the video recording tendered by the Respondent. I find this recording to be a neutral piece of evidence. As the Applicant had rightly submitted, the recording does not contain any audio and thus does not prove that the Applicant was shouting at the material time. In any event, the Applicant does not dispute the fact that he was in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the time of the recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To be clear, the finding in [15] above does not mean that I have found any of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Applicant has lied about the 2 June incident,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Respondent has “disproved” the Applicant’s case about the incident, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That she has “proved” her own account of the incident to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>(For a discussion on the concepts of “proved”, “disproved”, and “not proved”, see s 3(3) to s 3(5) of the Evidence Act 1893; <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 0286.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 286</a> at [18] to [21]; <em>R Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0063.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 63</a> at [35].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I emphatically decline to make the affirmative findings in [16] above. Such findings would have been based purely on the <em>testimonial</em> evidence by the Applicant and the Respondent only. I do not think that this is appropriate in the present case. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I do not have the benefit of important pieces of evidence that can shed light on what really happened during the 2 June incident. Such evidence includes the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       A voice recording of the Applicant asking the Respondent to come down from the matrimonial flat: see [13(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Evidence (e.g., from police officers present at the scene) on (1) whether the daughter was in the flat at the material time (see [12(b)] and [13(a)] above), (2) whether the Applicant appeared to intoxicated (see [13(e)] above), (3) whether he was in the company of his girlfriend and another male person (see [13(c)] and [13(d)] above), and (4) the Applicant’s and Respondent’s contemporaneous accounts to the police officers of what had transpired during the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Police have completed their investigations into the 2 June incident. The matter is now before AGC, presumably for a decision on whether there is any offence disclosed against the Applicant and/or the Respondent, and if so, whether to prosecute the relevant party. An affirmative finding by me, such as those in [16] above, (i) can potentially engage the principle of <em>res judicata</em> on some of the relevant factual issues, and (ii) can have implications on the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion and subsequent criminal proceedings, if any. Given the limitations of fact finding in [17(a)] above, it is best that I exercise judicial modesty and refrain from making affirmative findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To sum-up, I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the 2 June incident had occurred in the manner described by the Applicant. Furthermore, even on his account, I fail to see in what way the Respondent’s actions amount to an “abuse” of the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">29 June 2024 incident – Respondent’s visit to the mother’s flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I now turn to another incident which, according to the Applicant, demonstrates that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 29 June 2024, together with her son and other person(s), the Respondent “trespassed” into his mother’s flat unit. At the material time, his mother was alone. The Applicant came to know of this “trespass” when the Respondent’s son, and later the Respondent herself, made threatening calls to him and told him to go down to the mother’s flat. The Police was eventually summoned and the incident was defused thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Applicant tendered a video recording of the events at the flat unit as evidence. According to him, the recording showed the Respondent to be have snatched his mother’s handphone and to be behaving aggressively in the flat. The Applicant submitted that if the Respondent had been fearful of him, she would not have behaved in such a manner and demanded to see him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the Applicant, his mother was deeply disturbed by the Respondent’s actions on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Respondent’s account of the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent was troubled by the 2 June incident. On 29 June 2024, she had gone to seek the mother’s help to stop the Applicant and his girlfriend from creating problems for her and her children. The Respondent knew that the Applicant was not at home at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had entered the mother’s flat unit with her son and a female relative. While in the unit, the Respondent admitted that she had taken the mother’s phone. According to her, she merely wanted the mother to call the Applicant and to tell him to stop the harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the visit, the Respondent saw the mother at the market on 5 August 2024. The mother called out to her, and they spoke normally. Later that same day, the mother phoned the Respondent. (This call is reflected in the Respondent’s call log.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>) She submitted that if the mother had felt threatened by her due to the 29 June incident, the mother would not have spoken to her. The Respondent recorded her conversation with the mother on 5 August 2024. She however did not tender the recording in evidence because she could not afford the transcription fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my view, the Applicant has failed to prove his case that the 29 June incident was an example of the Respondent having “abused” the PPO. Specifically, the Applicant has failed to show how the Respondent had used the PPO to legitimise or excuse her conduct at his mother’s flat unit. I accept the Respondent’s reasons for going to the mother’s flat and that she was not there to create trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is clear from the recording that the Respondent was emotional at certain points during the visit. For instance, she broke down when she spoke to the Applicant’s mother – at times, telling her son that it was not the mother’s fault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This is consistent with the Respondent’s evidence that she was genuinely concerned and stressed by what the Applicant had done during the 2 June incident, and that she had gone to the flat to seek the mother’s help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it appears from the videos<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the Respondent’s son was also crying/sobbing when he spoke to the Applicant’s mother. At times, he was rubbing his eyes with what appears to be white tissue paper. There was also a moment when the son told the Respondent that he loved the Applicant’s mother, and the Respondent acknowledged this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, throughout her interaction with the Respondent and her son, the Applicant’s mother appears to be calm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, and importantly, the only other person who can discredit the Respondent’s evidence regarding the purpose of her visit on 29 June is the Applicant’s mother. She would have been able to testify, for instance, what had transpired during the visit and what the Respondent and her son had said to her. The Applicant did not call his mother to rebut the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Given the above, I find that the 29<sup></sup>June incident does not prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">16 September 2024 incident – Applicant’s visit to the matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to next incident which the Applicant relies on to prove that the Respondent had “abused” the PPO. His account of this incident is as follows.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 16 September 2024, the Applicant visited the matrimonial flat intending to see his daughter. On arriving at the flat unit, the Respondent’s fiancé, who was shirtless at the material time, came out from one of the rooms and started to provoke him. The Respondent and her son stood nearby, supporting the fiancé.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fiancé challenged the Applicant to a fight, and the ensuing argument continued out into the corridor. The Applicant remained calm throughout as his daughter was present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The fiancé and the Respondent later returned to the flat unit. The latter locked the gate, claiming that the IO had told her not to open the gate for him. The Applicant called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Police arrived at the scene, the fiancé eventually left the flat unit angrily and reluctantly, on the Police’s request. The Applicant tendered a video recording of the incident to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent’s evidence regarding the incident is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant had gone to the matrimonial flat to look for his daughter. The visit was unexpected as 16 September 2024 was not his child access day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Respondent, the Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the material time and had behaved in an abusive and provocative manner towards her fiancé. When her son tried to intervene because the Applicant was standing too close to her, the Applicant smacked his chest and verbally abused him. When the Respondent intervened, the Applicant grabbed her hand tightly. She managed to pull her hand away and her fiancé stepped in to de-escalate the matter. The Respondent called the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent understood from the IO that the Police have completed their investigations into the 16 September incident, and that the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is the Applicant’s case that the Respondent is using the PPO to prevent him from visiting the matrimonial flat to see his daughter. According to him, the Respondent is doing this so that she can cohabit with her fiancé in the matrimonial flat without any interference from the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I find that the events during the 16 September incident do not support the Applicant’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant’s case assumes that he had the right to see his daughter on 16 September 2024 and that the Respondent had wrongfully prevented him from doing so. This assumption is not correct. According to the Respondent, (i) 16 September 2024 was not the Applicant’s child access day, and (ii) he had turned up at the matrimonial flat without giving any prior notice. The Applicant did not dispute this aspect of the Respondent’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is evident from the video that the Applicant was unhappy with the fiancé’s presence in the flat and had taunted the Respondent, her son, and her fiancé. Given the tension at the material time, there could be safety issues if the Applicant was allowed into the flat. In the circumstances, the Respondent’s decision not to let the Applicant into the flat is understandable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, I find the Applicant’s claim that the Respondent has an ulterior motive to prevent him from seeing his daughter to be highly speculative. He has offered no evidence to prove that the fiancé was cohabiting with the Respondent in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given the above, I find that the Applicant has failed to prove that the 29<sup></sup>June incident is an example where the Respondent had “abused” the PPO for an alleged ulterior motive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">May to December 2023 – Respondent’s messages</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Finally, according to the Applicant, between May to December 2023, the Respondent (a) had made repeated phone calls and sent numerous messages to harass him and his girlfriend and (b) had posted libellous comments on social media against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Respondent denied making some of the relevant posts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> She explained that her (Facebook) account had been hacked at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I have difficulty accepting the Respondent’s explanation. For instance, there is no reason why the alleged hacker would send the relevant posts – e.g., new year greetings, and vitriolic comments on the affair between the Applicant and his girlfriend. Additionally, some of the posts contain information that is personal to the Respondent. That said, a determination of whether the Respondent’s Facebook account had been hacked is best made after forensic analysis has been done on the account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In any event, assuming that the relevant messages, phone calls, and posts were by the Respondent, I fail to see how they would amount to be an “abuse” of the PPO that warrants its revocation. For instance, there is no evidence that the Respondent had used the PPO as a shield for sending the objectionable messages, phone calls and posts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Applicant submits that the PPO should be revoked because the Respondent is not afraid of him or to do things which offends him. In my view, this argument does not take his case far. The central issue remains whether the Respondent and her son require the PPO for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO is still necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     This neatly brings me to the Applicant’s second reason for his application. According to him, the PPO is no longer necessary because the parties are now living apart and there has been no recent incident of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicant is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is well settled that the mere fact that parties have divorced and are no longer residing together do not constitute sufficient grounds for revoking a PPO: see e.g., <em>IS v IT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46932-M.xml')\">[2005] SGDC 66</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the present case, even though the parties are now living in separate households, I cannot rule out the possibility that the Applicant is likely to commit family violence in future. These are my reasons for coming to this view.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the parties will still need to interact with each other when the Applicant exercises his child access rights at the Respondent’s place of residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is still tension in the parties’ relationship. One of the causes for this tension is the Applicant’s unhappiness and concern that the fiancé is in contact with his daughter. This sentiment is one of the triggers for the 16 September incident – which occurred just three months before the date of this judgement. The Applicant’s unhappiness and concern will only increase when the Respondent and her fiancé live together after their marriage in December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is also evidence to suggest that the Applicant may have triggered the 2 June incident, created a scene, and threatened the Respondent with physical violence: see [13(b)] and [13(d)] above. The Police has completed their investigations into this incident and the matter is now with AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">26 September 2024 incident – Applicant allegedly assaulted the Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, and disturbingly, the Respondent has accused the Applicant of having committed yet another act of family violence just about two weeks before the hearing was due to start. According to her, the Applicant punched her face and kicked her leg in the evening of 26 September 2024. The alleged assault occurred when she was walking down her block of flats. After the assault, the Applicant allegedly told her that this was a “trial” and threatened to “whack” her again “soon”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> During the trial, the Respondent tendered photographs and a medical form to show that she had a bruise on her right chin and bruise/abrasion on her right thigh one day after the alleged assault.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> According to the Respondent, police investigations into this incident are ongoing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Applicant strongly denied the Respondent’s allegations. While he admitted to being in the vicinity of the matrimonial flat at the material time (to exercise at an area downstairs), he denied meeting her. The Applicant submitted that her evidence should be disbelieved for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no witness to the alleged assault, despite it having occurred during “peak hour”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent had made a police report about the assault only one day after the alleged incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the medical form, the Respondent “updated” that an e-scooter had also collided into her from the front.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Applicant submitted that the Respondent’s thigh injury is consistent with such a collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_d\"></a>(d)     One day after the alleged assault, there were text messages between the Respondent and the Applicant. She did not mention anything about the assault in those messages. During the hearing, the Applicant tendered the relevant messages to support his evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Applicant was not arrested in connection with the alleged assault. The IO apparently told him that this was because the Police believed that he was innocent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I am not persuaded by the Applicant’s submissions. In my view, it is not appropriate for me to reject the Respondent’s allegation of the assault outright.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Regarding [37(a)] – The mere absence of eyewitnesses is equivocal and does not disprove the alleged assault. This fact is equally consistent with the possibility that the assault may have been <em>premediated</em> – i.e., the Applicant might have <em>chosen</em> a moment or a location to assault the Respondent away from public eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding [37(b)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       During her examination-in-chief, the Respondent had explained that soon after the alleged assault, she called the IO. The IO returned her call only <em>the next day.</em> He told her to lodge a police report and that he would follow-up thereafter. The Respondent promptly made the report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In any event, I am of the view there is no undue delay in the Respondent lodging the police report. The report was lodged just one day after the alleged assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Regarding [37(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Respondent, the collision was a minor one and had merely caused her to fall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, the Applicant’s submission fails to account for the undisputed bruise on the Respondent’s right chin. The Applicant conceded during cross-examination that such an injury is more consistent with it having been caused by a punch than an e-scooter collision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Regarding [37(d)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is not correct to say that the Respondent had failed to mention anything in her text messages about the alleged assault one day after the incident. In one of these messages, the Respondent did ask the Applicant why he had transferred $316 to her, and whether it was “Doc fees for what u did”. The Respondent explained during the hearing that in this message, she was trying to clarify with the Applicant whether he had transferred the money to cover her medical expenses arising from the assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In his text message, the Applicant replied that the $136 was an “instalment” payment of the daughter’s maintenance. I find this reply to be puzzling. <em>First</em>, the Respondent testified that the Applicant had not paid maintenance by instalment before. The Applicant did not dispute this evidence. <em>Second</em>, it is strange why the Applicant chose to make an instalment payment of $136 – considering that the maintenance amount is $950. The Applicant did not explain how he had computed such an odd number for an instalment payment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Regarding [37(e)] – I do not give any weight to the opinion allegedly expressed by the IO. <em>First</em>, the IO’s identity is unknown. <em>Second</em>, the alleged opinion is inadmissible hearsay evidence. <em>Third</em>, the basis for the alleged opinion is unclear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In my view, there is basis to believe the Respondent’s evidence that the Applicant had punched her face: see [37(c)] above. That said, I decline to make an affirmative finding on this. The matter is still under investigations, and the Police has the resources to uncover the relevant evidence that can prove/disprove whether the alleged assault had indeed taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given the above, the Applicant has failed to prove his case that (a) the Respondent has “abused” the PPO and (b) there has been no recent incident of family violence: see [5] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is prudent for the PPO to remain in force. Minimally, it will remind the Applicant (a) to avoid high conflict situations with the Respondent and her son, and (b) not to use family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Accordingly, I dismiss SS 1031.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [10] to [16].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [17].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [17] and [18].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [28] and [32].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [21] and [22].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Respondent’s statement dated 11 October 2024 at page 1 (last paragraph) to page 2 (2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Exhibit R2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Call log is attached to the Respondent’s statement dated 11 October 2024 at pages 21 and 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Applicant’s affidavit dated 31 July 2024 at [23] to [25] and pages 41 and 42;

They had four daughters. As to why the marriage had broken down, that is set out in some detail in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The SOP states that the Husband had been abusive towards the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 September 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 13 June 2024. Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After parties had filed their first set of affidavit of assets and means (“AOMs”), the Wife took out an application in SUM 3168/2024 (“SUM 3168”). She sought leave for her four daughters to file a joint affidavit. The purpose of this joint affidavit was to respond to a point which the Husband had made in his AOM. The Husband had, according to the Wife, falsely alleged that certain pieces of jewellery acquired during the marriage were all his financial contributions. On this basis, the Wife states that it was necessary for the four daughters to “affirm their respective knowledge about the gold jewel[l]eries” which she had purchased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 3168 came up for hearing before me. I reserved judgment after hearing arguments from both parties. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where a party to divorce proceeding seeks to file an affidavit by a third party, leave of the court must be sought. That was a point made clear in the recent decision of the Family Division of the High Court in <em>WWM v WWN and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> (“<em>WWM</em>”) at [4]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4     First, I agree with counsel for the Husband that the plain wording of rr 89(2) and 89(3) FJR provides for a total of two AM affidavits by each party and any further affidavits beyond the two require leave of court. Nothing in the wording of r 89 FJR supports the Wife’s interpretation for two rounds of affidavits. Second, had the Wife exhibited the Children’s Affidavits in her second affidavit, the court could have likewise expunged those exhibits. <b>I thus do not accept the Wife’s interpretation of r 89 FJR. The affidavits of means envisaged under that rule are intended to be those of the parties themselves. </b><b><u>Any others may be filed only with leave.</u></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>[</u>emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In deciding whether leave should be granted, a key consideration is the relevance and necessity of the affidavit of the third-party to the hearing of the ancillary matters hearing (see <em>WWM</em> (at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       To assess the relevance and necessity of the joint affidavit which the Wife is seeking leave to file, I take, as the starting point, what each party had set out in their first AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This was what the Husband had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Just and equitable division of the jewelleries in the possession of the Plaintiff and other household items removed from the flat. During one of my hospitalisations, the Plaintiff who was then briefly staying at my daughter’s place came over to remove all the jewelleries from the flat. These are jewelleries acquired during the marriage which were all my financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This was what the Wife had said in relation to the gold jewellery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I own other assets as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    I had received the sum of $43,000.00 being my Dependent Protection Sum monies from XX in December 2017…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    I purchased 916 gold jewellery items for the total value of $32,519.64 namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">3 necklace</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 chains (including 2 young children ones)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">6 pair bangles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bangle</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 pendants</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">5 adult rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">2 children rings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">8 earrings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 bracelet</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 chain with pendant</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">1 ring</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    all my said gold jewellery items are in the [Husband’s] possession as my 3 younger daughters and I left the matrimonial Flat in November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Based on what the Husband and the Wife had set out in their respective first AOMs, the relevance of the proposed joint affidavit cannot be seriously disputed. It deals with the issue of who had bought the jewellery, and whether that jewellery had indeed been taken from the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As to the necessity of the proposed joint affidavit, counsel for the Husband, Mr Arul Suppiah (“Mr Arul”), had, during the hearing, pointed out that the court hearing the ancillary matters was well placed to draw its own inferences from what had been set out in the affidavits that had been filed by both the Husband and the Wife. Following this line of logic, there was no need for the proposed joint affidavit to be filed. This was especially since the four daughters were already biased against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Counsel for the Wife, Ms Gurmeet Kaur (“Ms Kaur”), however, argued that the daughters’ evidence was needed to corroborate the Wife’s version of events – namely, that it was the Wife who had purchased the jewellery with her own money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to whether the daughters are indeed biased against the Husband, that is not a matter which can be decided at this juncture. That is for the judge hearing the ancillary matters to consider, in weighing up the evidence given by the four daughters in the proposed joint affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In my judgment, the proposed joint affidavit is indeed necessary in that it would cast light on whether it was the Husband or the Wife who had bought the jewellery, and the source of funds used to purchase the jewellery.

I had earlier made orders in respect of SUM 2758: see <em>XEH v XEI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32433-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 93</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Han, argues that costs should be fixed at $2500 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife to the Husband. The reason for this is that the Husband, having succeeded in SUM 2758, was therefore entitled to costs. As to the quantum of such costs, Mr Han justifies the sum the Husband is seeking on the basis of the work done for SUM 2758.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In addition, Mr Han also refers to the State Court Practice Directions 2021 Appendix H: <em>Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards in District Court Cases in the State Courts of Singapore</em> to show that the quantum of $2500 was not a wholly unreasonable sum to seek.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife, on the other hand, filed her submissions on costs late in the day. I had directed parties to file their submissions on costs by 25 October 2024. On 1 November 2024, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Wife, informing her that these submissions on costs were to be filed by 8 November 2024, failing which, the court would proceed to make costs orders in respect of SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 November 2024, the Wife sent an email to the Family Court Registry enclosing a number of documents. This appeared to be an attempt to comply with the orders I had made in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Also contained in that email was the Wife’s written submissions on the costs of SUM 2758. In those set of submissions, the Wife argues that she should not have to pay costs of $2500 to the Husband. She gives two reasons. First, that the Husband had filed his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories late.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Second, that the Husband had, in taking out SUM 2758, caused further delays in the hearing of the ancillary matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Where costs are concerned, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event – in other words, the successful party is entitled to costs. The court, however, can depart from this starting point: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the present case, the Husband is the successful party in that he had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items he had sought in SUM 2758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       He is therefore entitled to costs. I see no reason to depart from the starting point that costs shall follow the event. While it is true that the Husband had only served his voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories 13 days after the deadline set by the court, this was, in my judgment, not such a lengthy delay which justified departing from the starting point that costs shall follow the event: see Rule 852 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $1600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of costs, I considered the number of items sought as well as the fact that SUM 2758 did not involve any novel points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In particular, I took into account the Wife’s conduct. I note from the minutes of the previous case conferences<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that the Wife had told the court that she was not going to respond to any voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories that the Husband might serve on her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She had also told the court that she would not file a reply affidavit to SUM 2758 because it was a “waste of time” and that she had neither the time nor the energy to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The voluntary disclosure regime in the context of discovery and interrogatories provides parties the opportunity to ask for documents and information that may have a bearing on the issues in dispute without having to take out a formal application to court. This, of course, can only work if the party on whom the voluntary request is served takes a sensible approach, and does not unreasonably object, or refuse to provide documents sought or give responses to interrogatories. If that party chooses to not respond to the voluntary request, they must then accept that the requesting party is then entitled to, as a matter of procedure, take out the relevant application: see Rule 63(4) FJR 2014. This would, naturally, result in a delay to the hearing of the ancillary matters whilst the application for discovery and/or interrogatories is heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Had the Wife made an attempt to respond to the Husband’s voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, there may not have been a need for SUM 2758, or that the items sought in SUM 2758 could have been reduced. She chose to not engage with the Husband’s voluntary request, or his application in SUM 2758 (see above at [10]). Such conduct, in my judgment, must be accounted for in the award of costs: Rule 854 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the reasons set out above, I order that the Wife shall pay the Husband the sum of $1600, being the costs of SUM 2758, by 15 January 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions on Costs at [3].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions on Costs at [4].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Skeletal Submissions on Costs at p 1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Skeletal Submissions on Costs at p 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Minutes of the Case Conferences held on 7 August 2024 and 12 September 2024 respectively.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Minutes of the Case Conference held on 7 August 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Minutes of the Case Conference held on 12 September 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Custody care control and access of children","Committal"],"date":"2024-12-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No FC/D 6089/2016, FC/SUM 3312/2023","title":"UUQ v UUR","citation":"[2024] SGFC 106","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32559-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Father (Represents himself): D Ganaselvarani (D Rani & Co) for the Mother"],"timestamp":"2024-12-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan","html":"<root><head><title>UUQ v UUR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> UUQ<font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\"> v</font> UUR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32559-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 106</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No FC/D 6089/2016, FC/SUM 3312/2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 December 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Father (Represents himself): D Ganaselvarani (D Rani &amp; Co) for the Mother </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> UUQ — UUR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Custody care control and access of children</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Committal</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Father of a 10-year-old child applies to commit the Mother for breaching an order giving the Father access to the child. I heard the parties and granted the Father’s application. The Mother appeals against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child’s Mother is the Plaintiff, and the child’s Father is the Defendant in the principal case, which was a divorce proceeding. The parents had married in June 2011 in Norway. At all material times, the Mother is a Singaporean and the Father a Norwegian. They lived in Norway for a few years and then moved to Singapore. Their relationship broke down, and by consent, they were divorced by an interim judgment in May 2017. The ancillary issues were not agreed upon. I heard and decided the ancillary issues in December 2018. The relevant part of my order stated as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The parents shall have Joint Custody of the child with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father shall have access as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Every Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekday access”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Every Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekend Access”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    From 1 June 2019, the Weekday access shall remain or adjusted to different days if agreed to by parties, or else shall remain the same; and weekend access shall be on alternate weekends Saturday 10 a.m. overnight to Sunday 2 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father is permitted to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from 2019. The Defendant shall ensure that the child is returned to Singapore to the Plaintiff no later than 30 December immediately thereafter. The Plaintiff shall release the child’s passport to the Defendant for this purpose. The Plaintiff shall also furnish the passport details of the child to the Defendant to enable travel arrangements to be made. The Defendant shall furnish the details of the visit including the travel documents and the addresses where the child shall be at to the Plaintiff in exchange for the child’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother appealed against my whole decision. Her appeal was heard in December 2019. The appeal was heard by the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon who made the following orders on the issue of the child (“the Order”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1</em>.     <em>Custody, care and control</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For the avoidance of doubt, as ordered by the District Judge in FC/ORC 1115/2019, the parties shall have Joint Custody of the child of the marriage, B (&quot;the Child&quot;), with care and control to the Plaintiff/Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>2</em>.     <em>Access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The orders of the District Judge for access in FC/ORC 1115/2019 are upheld, save as shown to be varied below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>.     <em>Weekday access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30 pm to 8.45 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>.     <em>Weekend access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall have access to the Child on alternative weekends from 10.00 am on Saturdays to 2.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>c</em>.     <em>Overseas access</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall be permitted to bring the Child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall ensure that the Child is returned to the Plaintiff/Mother in Singapore no later than 30th day of that December immediately after the temporary visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother is to keep the Child’s passport and maintain its validity for travels. She shall furnish the details of the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father to enable travel arrangements to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Defendant/Father shall furnish to the Plaintiff/Mother the details of the visits, including the travel documents and the addresses of places where the Child will be at no later than 21 days before the trip, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall release the Child’s passport to the Defendant/Father no later than 7 days before the trip.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Child’s passport shall be handed back to the Plaintiff/Mother together with the Child after the visits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Plaintiff/Mother shall inform the Defendant/Father whenever the Child travels overseas before such trips. Save for travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father this information no later than 21 days before the trips. For travels due to family emergencies and day trips outside of Singapore, the information shall be provided to the Defendant/Father once the trip is confirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>d</em>.     <em>Increase in length of overnight access sessions</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Parties are to endeavour to agree on having overnight access sessions for the Defendant/Father of longer durations, in particular during the Child’s school holidays, between now and December 2020. In the event that there is no agreement by the end of January 2020, either party may file an application to the Family Court to formalise the arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>e</em>.     <em>Pick-up point</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">For the access, the Defendant/Father shall pick-up and return the Child to the condominium where the Child resides, and the Plaintiff/Mother shall provide to the Defendant/Father an access card key to the entrance of the condominium to facilitate the pick-up and return of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father had access to the child from after December 2018 when I made my order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In August 2022, due to an altercation between the Father and the Mother regarding access, both parents filed applications for personal protections orders against each other. In the course of those proceedings, the Father agreed to undergo a POTS (Panel of Therapeutic Specialists) programme, but the Mother did not agree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before the protection cases were concluded, however, in November 2022 the Mother filed an application to vary the Order. She did not seek to disturb the orders on custody care and control of the Child, but she sought changes regarding access, as well as to remove a penal notice that had been attached to it. The Father objected to these requests and filed a cross application to vary the care and control of the Child to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 7 December 2022, after 3 days of hearing, the learned District Judge Amy Tung dismissed both the protection applications by the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother’s and Father’s variation applications were then heard by me in May 2023. I heard the parents. I interviewed the Child. In July 2023, I dismissed both applications. The Mother appealed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Pending the hearing of the appeal, in August 2023, the Father applied for 2 weeks of additional access during the end-of-year school holidays in lieu of more than 117 breaches of access, and for the Mother to produce the Child’s passport and personal documents for 15 days of overseas travel as provided for in the Order. Again, I heard both parties and I interviewed the Child.

She explains that on a few occasions the Child was unwell, or had contracted COVID, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022. During 28 February – 19 March 2023 the Child was in India with her, and so the Father could not have had access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the rest of the occasions, her position is simply that the Child did not want to see the Father nor to spend overnight with him, and she could not force the Child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother confirms that the Child loved the Father. She claims that the Child has not gotten used to overnight access with the Father, and he still complains about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     She says that the Child is a seeing a counsellor to help him handle his feelings. She adduces a copy of a report by the counsellor. The report shows that the counsellor arrived at some conclusions without having interviewed the Father. I find that this examination of the Child had been conducted without leave of the Court as required under Rule 35 of the Family Justice Rules:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Examination of child with leave of Court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35.—(1)    Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action or proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I therefore placed no reliance on its contents. In any event, the examination of the child was conducted not only without leave of the Court, but without notice to the Father or with his involvement. In any event, I find that the report is of no probative value to the issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I find that of the 117 occasions of breach alleged by the Father, 4 of them took place because the Child was ill, on 11, 13 &amp; 16 August 2022, and on 20 October 2022. I find that on those occasions, the Mother had reasonable cause to refuse the access, and therefore she did not breach the Order on those occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Of the remaining 113, the Father had partial access albeit not strictly according to the terms of the Order, on 9 &amp; 18 August 2022, 22 October 2022, 10 &amp; 22 November 2022, and 22 January 2023. I give the benefit of these partial compliances to the Mother, and therefore find that for those occasions she is not liable to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As for the remaining 107 times when the Father did not get access to the Child, I find that the Mother has no reasonable excuse. I do not accept that the blame lays with the Child. It is not disputed that there were no issues with access until suddenly in August 2022. This was when the Mother and the Father had an altercation that resulted in the PPO applications. The circumstances of that altercation was itself caused by the Mother’s refusal to give the Father access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Mother’s defence, that the Child does not want to spend overnight with the Father, does not explain the lack of weekday access that did not include overnighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In cases of access, occasional defaults due to reasons such as scheduling issues is understandable, but the sheer number of times that the access was not given in the present case show that this could not have been the case here. The extended and continuous length of the non-compliance over a period of a year displaces such reasonable excuses. It is irresistible to conclude that the non-compliance was nothing other than intentional and deliberate. I am not convinced that it is solely because the Child refused to see the Father. Throughout the trial, there was little before me to say why the Child would refuse to see his father. More stark is the fact that the Mother did not take steps to address the Child’s alleged reluctance. Even if I were to accept that there was reluctance on the part of the Child, the Mother had refused to have the issue referred to a therapist under the POTS scheme when the opportunity arose during the PPO proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I find it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, that the Mother is guilty of contempt of court in that she did not comply with the Order in a total of 107 times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Mitigation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In mitigation, the Mother’s learned counsel argues that the Child had indicated to the Mother that he did not wish to go for the overnight and overseas access, and that it was not possible to force the Child to go for the access against his wishes. She argues that the Child was no longer small enough to be carried off to access against his will. Therefore, Counsel argues, the Mother had done all that was needed on her part. The Child is of age that he is able to speak what he wants. She argues that as such, the Mother should not be penalised. She suggested that counselling to be ordered so her client can attend instead of committing her for the breaches. Alternatively, she asked for any committal order to be suspended, for the parents to attend counselling on how to deal with the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Father, who represents himself, argues that the breaches were significant. The Mother has not shown any remorse or take responsibility. She has had opportunities to address the issue. The Father agrees to a suspension of committal, but he says he believes that things will not change unless there is a significant risk imposed on the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I note that provision for punishment for contempt of court is found in the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016, in particular, in subsection 12 (c):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Punishment for contempt of court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“12.—(1</em>)     <em>Except as otherwise provided in any other written law, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished —</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the General Division of the High Court in relation to contempt in the face of or in connection with any proceedings in a State Court, Family Court or Youth Court (as the case may be), with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by any other court, with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I take into account that this is the first time that the Mother is guilty of contempt. I take into account that she does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I also take into account that she contested the case against her. I take into account that she does not contest that the Father had not had access to the Child for a year preceding his application. I take into account that the Mother committed these breaches even after her application to vary the terms of access had been dismissed by me, and also by the High Court. I take into account that if indeed the Child was unwilling to see the Father for reasons beyond her control, the Mother had refused to address the issue by accepting therapy under the POTS scheme. These factors weigh against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is in the best interest of every child to have relationships with both parents. Relationships can only be built upon a strong foundation of contact and time spent together. Access orders are issued to meet this goal. It follows that such orders must be carried out. It is the basic duty of parents to ensure that access arrangements are followed through, to and come to mutual adjustments to deal with issues when they arise, but always with the intent to ensure that access is provided, so that the child has full space and time to build and maintain a relationship with the access parent. When there is a difficulty in complying, then it is a parental duty to address it. The Mother had failed to meet this duty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that it is fair and just that the Mother be fined $8,000.00 which is to be paid within 1 month, in default of which she be imprisoned for 4 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I find it appropriate and just to I suspend this Committal Order provided the Mother does not commit any further breach of the 3 December 2019 Order of Court for a period of 1 year. If she fails to comply with the terms on which this Committal Order is suspended, the Father shall be at liberty to apply inter partes to the Court to consider whether the Committal Order should be enforced or discharged [<em>Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0870.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 870</a></em>].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I urge the Mother to come to arrangements with the Father and with the Child to undergo therapy to address the access issues. With sincerity and effort, I hope the Child will enjoy a happy and positive relationship with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On costs, the Mother says that she is not able to pay any costs. She had not paid costs for the appeal. She does not have a job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father argues that the case had been going on 12 months. He had to serve a penal notice, file a leave application, filed 3 affidavits, attend case conferences, and several hearings.

I had earlier given my decision and made orders for discovery: <em>XEF v XEG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 92</a> (“<em>XEF</em>”). This is my decision on the costs of SUM 2244.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Michael Chang (“Mr Chang”) argues that the Husband should be entitled to costs fixed at $2000 (all-in). Mr Chang makes the point that the Wife had: <b>a)</b> consistently refused to disclose her documents throughout the proceedings, <b>b)</b> refused to comply with the court’s directions. This had all resulted in the wastage of resources and caused undue delay which should be reflected in the award of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Wife, Ms Samantha Ee (“Ms Ee”), on the other hand, argues that no costs should be awarded. She gives two reasons. First, the Husband was not successful in his application and the Wife had already been prejudiced by the delay in the proceedings occasioned by the Husband’s actions. Second, that the need to minimise acrimony between the parties weighs in favour of making no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As a starting point, costs follow the event, though the court can, in the exercise of its discretion, depart from this starting point: see <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. One other point which bears noting is that while the Husband is legally-aided, in my assessment of costs, he is not to be treated differently from a litigant who is not legally-aided: see s 16(1) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, the Husband had only succeeded in obtaining orders in respect of two out of the four items sought in discovery. While he could not be said to have succeeded in his application, he is, in my judgment, still entitled to costs on the basis that these documents could have, and should have, been disclosed when he had made his voluntary request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In this connection, it is apparent to me that the Wife does not have any good reasons for failing to disclose the documents sought at the voluntary stage. The Wife explains that she redacted certain transactions in her bank statement because she was concerned that the Husband would engage in an exercise in forensic accounting to make her account for every dollar that had been spent and that this would only serve to further protract matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This is not a good reason for refusing to disclose the unredacted bank statement. The law is clear that the court will not be inclined to grant orders for discovery or interrogatories where the applicant clearly wants these documents to make the other party account for every single transaction: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [14] – [15]; <em>XDD v XDE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32212-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 79</a> at [9] – [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In relation to the Wife’s IRAS Notice of Assessment (“NOA”), the Wife claims that she did not intend to employ a “tit-for-tat” approach in stating that she would only disclose her IRAS statements if the Husband provided his latest IRAS NOA as well. She says that she was troubled by the Husband’s refusal to exchange his IRAS NOA even when she had suggested that both parties exchange their respective IRAS NOAs. She suggests that this demonstrates that the Husband would not provide his IRAS NOA even if she had issued a “formal request for discovery”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife’s decision to not disclose these documents appears to be a purely strategic one calculated at, hopefully, expediting proceedings by reducing opportunities for the Husband to file further summons for discovery or interrogatories. What the Wife had left out of the equation was the additional time that would be incurred if the Husband had to file his own summons to compel her to disclose documents which she could have produced in the first place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In that vein, the Wife also points the finger at the Husband for filing SUM 2244 so late in the day. She says that by doing so, he had prolonged matters by more than six months (from April to October 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     This is not an entirely fair characterisation of what had transpired. I note from the minutes of the case conference on 20 June 2024 that the court had granted the Wife an extension of time of 1 week to provide her voluntary disclosure. Had the Wife provided the documents sought, that might have been the end of the matter and timelines could have possibly been brought forwards by three months at the very least.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although Ms Ee rightly points out that the court may make no order as to costs to minimise acrimony between the parties, the Wife’s conduct in this matter must also be taken into account. First, as I have noted, the Wife had a role in prolonging matters as the documents which the Husband had obtained orders for discovery could have been disclosed earlier. This was certainly not conducive to reducing acrimony between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Second, there is also the position which the Wife had taken at the hearing of SUM 2244. She had argued that the Husband could have avoided the need to ask for the Wife’s NOA in discovery had he agreed to her “reasonable proposal” to exchange the documents on a mutual basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This was, as I had noted in my judgment (<em>XEF</em> at [14]), not a basis on which disclosure could be resisted. In any event, the better approach, which the Wife could have taken, was to disclose her NOA, and to ask the Husband for the same if she thought that the Husband’s NOA was also relevant to the issues in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In short, the Wife could have taken a course of action which would minimise or eliminate further avenues for conflict. She did not seize that opportunity. Given this, I did not think it open to her to now argue that no order of costs should be made in the interests of reducing or minimising acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the circumstances, I find that the Wife should have to pay costs for SUM 2244. Taking into account the factors I have highlighted above, these costs are fixed at $1100 (all-in). Parties are in agreement that these costs should be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. I therefore order that the Wife pay this sum of $1100 to the Director of Legal Aid. This is to be done by 31 December 2024.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Variation of Ancillary Matters Orders – Maintenance"],"date":"2024-11-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3897 of 2013","title":"XFU v XFV","citation":"[2024] SGFC 104","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32491-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Mohamed Fazal bin Abdul Hamid & Mr Muhammad Aadil bin Dafir (I.R.B.

The defendant mother (“the Mother”) disagreed to the variation sought by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father and Mother (“the Parties”) were married in December 2004 and have three children, S, a girl, who was born in 2007 (“S”), M, a boy, who was born in 2009 (“M”) and R, a boy, who was born in 2012 (“R”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In August 2013, the Father commenced divorce proceedings citing the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The Interim Judgment was granted, on an uncontested basis, in April 2014 with the ancillary matters adjourned to be heard in chambers. The court delivered its final orders in respect of the ancillary matters on 5 August 2015 (“the 2015 Order”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The orders in respect of maintenance for the S, M and R (“the children”), which was the central issue before me in the current application, read as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>a)     The Father shall pay the Mother monthly maintenance of $6,000 for the maintenance of the Mother and three children, namely S, M and R, for 18 months beginning 31 August 2015 and thereafter on the last day of each month until the last day of January 2017;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>b)     Commencing 28 February 2017, the Father shall pay the Mother (i) monthly maintenance of $4,000 for the maintenance of their three children and (ii) nominal maintenance of $1 per month for the Mother’s maintenance;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The 2015 Order essentially fixed maintenance at the initial sum of $6,000 per month, which decreased to $4,000 per month in 2017; this mechanism was in-built into the 2015 Order. The Final Judgment was issued on 14 August 2015. The Father remarried in 2016 and has two children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> from his current marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The current application for variation of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father filed the current application to vary the children’s maintenance under the 2015 Order in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>a)     Maintenance of $4,000 be temporarily varied to $0 and backdated from 1 Jan 2023 until such time the Father obtains new employment paying him at least S$15,000.00 each month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>b)     Further and/or in the alternative in the event the Father obtains new employment paying him at least S$8,000.00 each month, the Father shall pay the Mother monthly maintenance of S$1,200.00 for the maintenance of their three children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Parties subsequently attended mediation to amicably resolve the variation application; their efforts, however, were unsuccessful. The variation application thereafter came up before me for a hearing, at which both parties were represented by counsel. On 22 August 2024, I delivered my decision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, allowing the Father’s application and varying the children’s maintenance downwards, but not to the extent sought by the Father.

In fact, for five out of the last eight years, the Father earned between $205,000 and $243,000 per year. I also noted Father’s evidence indicating that he had significant work experience<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>. For all these reasons, I did not consider his income of $76,375, in the Year of Assessment 2024, reflective of his true income or earning capacity, and was confident that he would find suitable employment in short order. In this regard, I also noted that while he was unemployed from 1 January 2023 to 31 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>, he eventually found employment; there was nothing to suggest that the same would not happen now.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the Mother’s income, I noted that she received monthly rental income from renting out rooms in her flat.

According to the Mother, she was unable to find employment due to the children’s needs. On the other hand, the Father contended that this was just a façade to apportion more financial responsibility to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. I noted the Mother’s concerns over the children’s health challenges; however, they were not reasons, <em>in and of themselves</em>, not to find employment <em>at all</em>. The Mother must make meaningful efforts which result in her employment. That being said, I could only rely on the parties’ recent income and expenses in making orders in the current application. In my view, it would be incorrect to <em>lower</em> the Father’s current contributions to the children’s maintenance by <em>guessing</em> the Mother’s future income; the children’s expenses remained the joint responsibility of both parents and they must both try harder for the sake of their children. The Father’s “squeezing water from stone<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>” argument, therefore, cut both ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Based on the children’s total current reasonable expenses of $4,076, the Father’s 86% contribution was therefore about $3,500<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>. This was how I arrived at the sum of $3,500 as the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Finally, the Father also asked me to consider his remarriage and two children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> from his current marriage as a factor. My view was this: it was incorrect for the Father to assert that he could not afford to pay reasonable maintenance for the children when he had <em>voluntarily</em> taken on additional financial obligations for his new family; the decision to take on any additional financial obligations must have regard to the existing ones - I therefore trust that the Father could afford to do both. I was accordingly unable to place much weight on this factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Commencement date of the new maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As the Father’s application to lower the children’s maintenance was filed on 26 June 2023, I considered it appropriate to order that the new maintenance amount take effect on this date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Based on the evidence and for the reasons stated above, I was satisfied that the Father had met the burden of proving that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 2015 Order warranting a downward variation of the children’s monthly maintenance, and I made orders accordingly. After hearing parties on costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       On 7 May 2024, the Mother filed an application to enforce the maintenance order made in respect of the child of the marriage in FC/IJ xx/2019. The matter came before me for hearing on 3 September 2024 and after hearing from the parties, I allowed the Mother’s application and determined that arrears amounted to a sum of $4,711 as at 3 September 2024. I then ordered that the respondent father (“Father”) pay this amount in 2 instalments on 1 October 2024 and 1 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father has filed an appeal against my decision, and I set forth below the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties in this case had filed for divorce in November 2015. Interim Judgement was granted on 7 March 2019 and various consent orders were recorded at the same time. These included orders granting joint custody of the then 3-year-old child of the marriage to both parents with sole care and control of the child to the Mother as well as orders relating to the child maintenance that was to be paid by the Father to the Mother. In relation to the maintenance for the child, the orders provided as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“MAINTENANCE FOR THE CHILD</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">j.     <em><u>Monthly maintenance payments</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>For the month of February 2019, the Defendant shall pay maintenance of $2,314, which shall be deposited directly into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account by 8 February 2019 (Friday).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>k</em>.     <em>Thereafter, the Defendant shall pay maintenance of $3,350 per month, which shall be deposited via GIRO or standing instructions into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account by 1 March 2019 and thereafter on or before the 1st day of each subsequent month, regardless of whether the 1st day of the month falls on a weekday or a weekend day.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>l</em>.     <em>For avoidance of doubt, the sum of $3,350 at sub­paragraph (k) above comprises $1,807.85 being the child’s monthly school fees at LV for 2019 and $1,542.15 being the Defendant’s contribution towards the child’s share of household and maid expenses, and the child’s personal expenses excluding those items specifically mentioned below. In the event the school fees at LV increase beyond $1,807.85, the Defendant shall bear 60% of the increase and this amount shall be added to the Defendant’s monthly maintenance payments accordingly (i.e. if the child’s school fees increase from $1,807.85 to $1,907.85 per month, the Defendant shall add $60 to his monthly maintenance payments).”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above orders relating to child maintenance also went on to list other items of the child’s expenses including health insurance, medical and medication, dental costs, international school fees, transportation to and from international school etc and specified that these would be shared equally between the parties (“Original Maintenance Order”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Five (5) years have passed since the consent orders were recorded and the child is now 8 years of age. While there have been formal applications to vary the orders relating to some of the child issues, to date, no applications have been made to vary the Original Maintenance Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law and issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother’s application for enforcement of child maintenance was filed under section 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”) which provides that where a maintenance order has been made under section 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”), and the person ordered to pay maintenance has failed to make one or more payments required, an application may be made for the court to enforce the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In determining whether to make an enforcement order, it is necessary for the following issues to be considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Father has failed to pay maintenance in accordance with the terms of the prevailing maintenance order and, if so what is the amount in arrears;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where it has been determined that maintenance payments are in arrears, whether the Father has explained i.e. “shown cause” as to why he has not complied with the maintenance order; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Depending on whether the Father has “shown cause”, what is the appropriate enforcement order to be made having regard to the circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Where the parties mutually agree to vary the terms of a maintenance order, the courts have accepted that this should be considered even where no formal application to vary the court order has been made. In <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> the Court found on the evidence that the Complainant had agreed to the Respondent’s request for a reduction of maintenance for a period of time due to his financial difficulty. Although there was no court ordered variation, taking into consideration the agreement mutually reached by the parties, the District Court accepted that the arrears which had accrued during that period of time where parties agreed to the payment of a lower amount of maintenance, should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother claimed maintenance arrears of $4,711. It was her position that although the Original Maintenance Order had provided for child maintenance of $3,350 per month, the parties had sometime in October 2022 when the child was changing schools reached agreement for the child’s maintenance to be varied to an amount of $2,485 per month excluding school fees which was to be shared by the parties equally outside of this amount. Accordingly, she was only looking to enforce the maintenance arrears in relation to this amount. She informed the court that since October 2022, the Father had paid this agreed amount of $2,485 per month to her and had only stopped paying this amount in May 2024.

He also did not dispute the fact that he had paid this monthly sum of $2,845 to the Mother as the child’s expenses from October 2022 to May 2024, a period of 18 months. His position was that he had misinterpreted and miscalculated the child maintenance amount set out in the Original Maintenance Order when he had written to the Mother in October 2022. It was his position that the amount of $3,350 per month had included the child’s kindergarten school fees of $1,807.85 and since the child’s school fees were now being paid separately by the parties in equal shares, based on the Original Maintenance Order, the balance amount of $1,542.15 should be what he should have been paying as child maintenance. He explained that he had only recently realised that he had been overpaying all this time and accordingly, since May 2024, he has started paying the amount of $1,543 to the Mother as child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent argued that under section 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”), the court is only empowered to enforce a court ordered maintenance order and since no order had been recorded when the parties had varied the child maintenance amount from $3,350 per month to $2,485 per month, the Complainant should not be allowed to bring an enforcement application against him in reliance of a mutual agreement as this had not been officially recorded as a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the respondent has failed to pay maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Original Maintenance Orders had provided that the monthly child maintenance was $3,350 and clarified that this comprised of $1,807.85 being the child’s monthly school fees at the time and $1,542.15 being the Father’s contribution towards the child’s expenses which included household expenses, maid expenses as well as the child’s personal expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Original Maintenance Order also detailed how other expenses were to be shared between the parties and this included international school fees and charges which were to be borne by the parties equally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In October 2022 parties exchanged emails discussing various amounts and expenses that had been incurred for the child as well as on the issue of school fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. On 13 October 2022, the Father wrote to the Mother by email and stated in the third paragraph under the heading of “School Fees” as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“LV October: The calculation is wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">According to the agreement, we both pay SGD 1,807.85.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">LV increased the fee to SGD 1,870, there is a difference of SGD 63.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Of those SGD 63, I contribute 60% and you 40%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That means that my contribution is: SGD 37.80 (60% of the increment) + SGD 903.925 (50% of LV) – SGD 941.725.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">October fee for LV was: SGD 1000.45/2: SGD 500.225 (each).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It would appear from the above that the Father had acknowledged that there had been an error in the Original Maintenance Order where the school fees for the child’s kindergarten appears to have been a total of $1,807.85 but that his share of the school fees should have only been $941.725.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I noted further that in that same email, under the heading of “Child maintenance moving forward”, the Father went on to state as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“Current Maintenance (CM) is: SGD 3,427 – LV SGD 951.70 = SGD 2,485.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Taking into consideration the above, I determined that the parties had agreed that there had been a miscalculation in the Original Maintenance Order and this email exchange sought to correct that error.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Following the email exchange referred to above, the parties operated on the premise that an agreement had been reached to vary the child maintenance from $3,350 to $2,485. This was evidenced by the fact that the Father paid to the Mother a sum of $2,485 per month as child maintenance for a period 18 months from October 2022 to April 2024. The Father did not dispute that there had been an agreement between the parties to vary the Original Maintenance Order nor did he dispute that he had made the payments during the abovementioned period. It was also not disputed that the above amounts excluded the child’s school fees which had been paid by the parties in equal shares separately. Accordingly, I accepted that parties had mutually agreed that the child maintenance would be reduced to a sum of $2,485 (excluding school fees). Additionally, even though no formal application had been made to vary the Original Maintenance Order, since October 2022 the parties had operated on the basis that the current applicable child maintenance amount was $2,845.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father argued that in enforcement proceedings, the court can only enforce a recorded order of court. I did not agree with this as this would clearly lead to an overly technical and unjust result. It should be noted that the courts have in various circumstances recognised agreements reached by the parties in the context of considering if a respondent in a suit had shown sufficient cause not to have certain amounts of arrears enforced against him (see <em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, at [21]; <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a>, at [20] – [22] ) and have allowed reliance on such a mutual agreement. There would be no good reason why a complainant should likewise not be allowed to rely on such a mutual agreement arrived at between the parties especially since the parties had both operated on the basis of this mutual agreement over a prolonged period of time. Accordingly, I considered the Original Maintenance Order but took into consideration the subsequent mutual agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother explained that she had not sought to bring a formal application to court to vary the consent order previously recorded as her understanding was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Because it was, .. … we were able to agree with the Respondent and that’s why we have it written on email with the corrected breakdown and as established practice for 2 years. ….. my understanding is that….. with the Respondent we can agree on something without needing to go through the Court. ……. It’s accepted.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I wholeheartedly agreed with the Mother. In line with the philosophy of Therapeutic Justice (“TJ”) adopted by the Family Justice Courts on 21 October 2024, a key objective of TJ is to encourage parties to move forward, enabled and equipped to resolve any future disagreements. Not enforcing what the parties had mutually agreed to and operated on, would go against the essence of the philosophy of TJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In light of the above, I arrived at the conclusion that the relevant amount of monthly child maintenance that should be paid by the Father to the Mother was $2,485 and as it was not disputed that the Father had from May 2024 to September 2024 only paid a sum $1,543 per month save that in June 2024, he paid a sum of $1,542, I determined that he had failed to pay the full amount of child maintenance which he was obligated to pay and that the arrears of child maintenance totalled a sum of $4,711.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father has shown cause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The question to be determined is whether the Father had provided good reason why he had not paid the arrears of child maintenance i.e. shown cause. Apart from maintaining that he had been mistaken in his calculations and should have followed what had been stated in the Original Maintenance Order strictly (which has already been addressed above), the Father brought no other evidence and provided no other explanation as to why he had not paid the agreed maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the issue of his mistake, I would note that based on the evidence before me, it was clear that the Father had spotted the mistake in the Original Maintenance Order in October 2022 and had taken steps to rectify the calculations which had thereafter been mutually agreed upon. After operating in this manner for 18 months and with the Mother having relied on this for the same period, I did not think that he should now be allowed to renege on his position and argue that he had misunderstood the Original Maintenance Order. In the circumstances, I did not find that he had provided good reason to explain why he had not paid the maintenance arrears of $4,711.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">What is the appropriate enforcement order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     During the trial, the Father indicated that he currently worked part time in the advertising industry and earned a net salary of $5,200. His expenses totalled an amount above $6,000 including a sum of $1,543 per month for the child’s maintenance. He admitted during cross-examination that he had previously been a creative director of a big advertising agency and had at some point in his career earned a salary of more than $200,000 per annum without bonus and benefits. This was borne out by his Notice of Assessment for 2022 to 2024<sup>4</sup>, where he earned an average annual income of $231,896. The Father provided no explanation as to why he had left his previous advertising jobs to take on a part time role where he earned roughly a quarter of what he had previously earned. In addition, he admitted that he had a savings plan life insurance with more than $4,000 in that account. Taking into consideration all of the evidence before me, I determined that it would be appropriate for the Father to pay the arrears of $4,711 in two (2) instalments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The court’s participation and intervention is required where parties are unable to see eye to eye and to reach agreement on their own. Notwithstanding, especially in line with the philosophy of TJ, parties are encouraged to learn to work together as co-parents and to resolve issues between themselves without having to come to court on every occasion.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>FC/IJ xx/2019, paragraph 3(l)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>FC/IJ xx/2019, paragraph 3(m) and (n)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Complainant bundle of documents marked as C1 on page 20 and 21</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript of proceedings on Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2024 on page 10 of 39, lines 16 to 21</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Considerations for determining whether conduct amounts to family violence under the “continual harassment” limb in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Considerations for making personal protection orders","Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Considerations for determining the duration of personal protection orders"],"date":"2024-10-18","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 864 of 2024","title":"XFL v XFM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 103","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32471-SSP.xml","counsel":["Rajwin Singh Sandhu (M/s Rajwin & Yong LLP) for the Wife","Patrick Fernandez (M/s Fernandez LLC) for the Husband."],"timestamp":"2024-11-20T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XFL v XFM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XFL <em>v</em> XFM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

In this regard, s 65(1) of the Charter states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that <em>family violence has been committed </em><b><em>or </em></b><em>is likely to be committed against a family member</em> and that <em>it is necessary for the protection of the family member</em>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold and italics added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     On a plain reading of s 65(1), the Wife must prove two things to succeed in her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife must prove that the Husband had committed or “is likely” to commit family violence against the Son and herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, she must also prove that a PPO “is necessary” to protect the Son and herself from future violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I have some general observations regarding these requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">First requirement – Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is clear from s 65(1) that there is <em>no need</em> for an applicant to prove that family violence has been committed to satisfy the first requirement. It is sufficient for the applicant to show – on a balance of probabilities – that such violence “is likely to be committed against a family member”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This reading is in line with –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the <em>“pre-emptive”</em> purpose of a PPO – i.e., to protect an applicant from family violence, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the settled principle that a PPO is <em>not intended to punish</em> a respondent for past violence: <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> (“<b><em>Lai Kwok Kin</em></b>”) at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [10]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> (“<b><em>WSD</em></b>”) at [1].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Second requirement – Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now come to the second requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Risk assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Clearly, the question of whether a PPO is necessary or not involves a risk assessment – i.e., <em>how likely will the respondent commit family violence against the applicant in future?</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     If there is little or no risk of such violence, then the applicant does not require protection, and a PPO will thus be unnecessary.

Courts have dismissed such applications where they are sought –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     To bolster an applicant’s request for the care and control of her children: <em>CSW</em> at [13]-[17];</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     To indirectly challenge a child handover order: <em>CSW</em> at [18] and [19];</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To resolve a dispute regarding (i) child access (<em>UNQ</em> at [39]) or (ii) trivial matters (<em>VKW</em> at [15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Need for deterrence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Finally, it is also relevant to consider whether there is a need for a PPO to <em>deter</em> future family violence. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The possibility of arrest and being investigated by the Police can be a powerful deterrent against the commission of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     However, such a possibility may not be available if the offence arising from such violence is a “non-arrestable offence” in law. Examples include family violence which involve (i) assault / using criminal force under s 352 and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. What this means is that the perpetrators of such offences cannot be arrested without a warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A PPO can address this issue. This is because the breach of a PPO is itself an arrestable offence: s 65(11) of the Charter. Thus, a respondent who voluntarily causes hurt to an applicant after the latter has been given a PPO may be arrested for breaching the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I will now apply the above principles to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband has committed family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I find that the Husband had committed family violence. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence on 14 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26      <em>First</em>, there is the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had slapped the 2½-year-old Son and whipped him with a dog leash on 14 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband did not dispute that such an act, if true, would constitute family violence. Indeed, during the trial, it was put to the Wife that whipping the Son with a leash was a serious and cruel act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The only factual matter that had to be decided is whether the Husband did in fact whip and slap the Son. In my view, the answer is yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There is no evidence to show why the Wife would want to falsely accuse the Husband of having whipped the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the fact that such an act had taken place is supported by objective evidence. There are photos that show injuries on the Son’s left cheek and left forearm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> I found the Husband’s evidence that these injuries might have been caused by heat rash, mosquito bites, or the Son scratching himself to defy belief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife’s claim that the Husband had whipped the Son with a dog leash is also supported by the Husband’s own admission to having used the dog leash to force the Son to eat. I disbelieve his evidence that the leash was used merely as a “scare tactic”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband submitted that I should disbelieve the Wife’s evidence regarding the 14 April incident because there is no medical report of the Son’s injuries or police report regarding the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I was not persuaded by the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had explained that she was afraid that if she had brought the Son to see a doctor or lodged a police report, this could cause the Husband to lose his job and thus cause the family to suffer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I found this explanation to be inherently credible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Wife’s explanation is supported by the long audio recording. In the recording, the Husband could be heard <em>repeatedly</em> warning the Wife not to complain to the police as doing so would “destroy” his life and the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence on 6 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30      <em>Second</em>, there is the Wife’s evidence regarding the 6 May incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband submitted that he did not commit family violence during the incident because he did cause hurt to either the Wife or the Son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Given [16] above and the nature of the Wife’s case (see [4] to [9] above), to make out the first requirement, it is sufficient if the Wife could prove –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       That the Husband had wilfully or knowingly placed her in fear of hurt,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       That he had committed acts of continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that the harassment was likely to cause anguish to her, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       That he was likely to commit family violence in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is evident from the audio recordings that the Husband had a violent temperament.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       For about 20 mins, the Husband “went crazy” (to borrow his own words) – he repeatedly shouted, used expletives, and even kicked a table – all because of (1) how he had perceived the Wife to have mis-managed the Son’s feeding and (2) her decision to call the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       During the entire episode, the Wife did not do anything that could reasonably be said to be provocative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       From the audio recordings, the Husband’s tone and words to the Wife were clearly threatening. He must have known that such aggression had affected the Wife – she repeatedly told him not to speak harshly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence on other occasions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>Third</em>, the Wife had also alleged that there were other incidents where the Husband was physically violent towards the Son and her: see [8(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In my view, the Wife is probably telling the truth regarding these incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife struck me an honest witness who gave evidence in a straightforward manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Wife’s complaints of family violence were motivated by malice, she could easily have embellished her evidence – e.g., by claiming that the Husband had inflicted <em>physical</em> harm on the Son during the 6 May incident, or by testifying he had committed <em>more</em> incidents of family violence. She did not do so – despite having been specifically questioned on these matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In contrast, there is evidence that the Husband could be manipulative. For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the trial, the Husband tried to portray the Wife as someone who was aggressive and who used vulgarities. However, this is not borne out by both the audio recordings and the Wife’s conduct during the trial. She spoke calmly and was soft-spoken in the audio recordings and in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     During the trial, the Husband had also explained that the loud crash heard in the long audio recording was the sound of a passing motorcycle. I found this explanation to be incredible – as the sound did not resemble what the Husband had described.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the long audio recording, the Husband could be heard (a) trying to dissuade the Wife from reporting him to the Police because it would “destroy” the family, and (b) threatening to “go crazy” and to evict the Wife’s father “straight away” if she insisted on reporting him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether there had been continual harassment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, there is the Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Claim – i.e., the Husband had “continually harassed” her intending to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause her “anguish”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     To prove family violence under the “continual harassment” limb, the following must be established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Courts have recognised repetitive conduct that causes worry, emotional distress or annoyance as coming within the scope of “continual harassment” under limb (d): see e.g., <em>Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In my view, the Husband had committed family violence under the “continual harassment” limb.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the 6 May incident, the Husband could be heard in the audio recordings repeatedly (i) berating the Wife and (ii) using vulgar and demeaning language towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Wife, the 6 May incident was not the only time that the Husband had treated her in such a manner. For the reasons stated in [34] above, I believed her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband must have known that his repeated use of vulgar and demeaning language towards the Wife would cause her emotional distress. In the long audio recording, the Wife could be heard repeatedly telling him to stop using such offensive language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having found that the first requirement for PPO has been proved, I now come to the issue of whether a PPO is necessary to protect the Wife and the Son (i.e., the second requirement for a PPO).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I am mindful that the Wife and Son are no longer staying in the Flat with the Husband. This can support an argument that they do not need any protection from the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view however, a PPO is still necessary. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is clear to me that the Husband resented the Wife for (i) having left the Flat with the Son, (ii) how she had been caring for the child, and (ii) having deprived him of access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, at the time of the PPO hearing, the issue of which party is to have care, control, and access to the child had not been conclusively resolved with a court order on ancillary matters yet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the parties will need to interact to facilitate the Husband’s access to the Son. The evidence shows that the Husband was prepared to resort to force to get back the Son. According to the Wife, after 6 May 2024, there was an occasion when she facilitated a meeting between the Husband and the Son. On that occasion, the Husband had attempted to run away with the child. The Husband did not dispute this aspect of the Wife’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband seemed to have little insight into his violent temperament. For instance, he claimed that it was normal for couples to use vulgar language at each other. Additionally, the Husband alleged that he was agitated during the 6 May incident because the Wife had used profanities against him. This claim is not supported by the audio recordings. Even if the Wife had provoked the Husband, his continual verbal abusive of her is wholly disproportionate. The Husband’s explanations for his behaviour during the 6 May incident show two things: either (i) he had little insight into his anger management issues, or (ii) he was not remorseful for his behaviour. This is a matter of concern given [41(a)] to [41(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Given the above, I order that the Husband is not to use family violence in any form against the Wife and the Son. I wish to emphasise to the Husband two things. <em>First</em>, it is an offence to contravene the order that I have made. <em>Second</em>, if the Husband were to intentionally contravene the order, he can be arrested and be punished with a fine and/or imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The PPO shall take immediate effect and last for a period of 24 months. (In other words, the order will expire on 17 October 2026.) In determining the duration of the PPO, I have considered the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is settled law that the reach of a judicial decision or order should not be excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When this principle is applied to s 65, what this means is that a PPO should not extend beyond the duration necessary to protect an applicant. In determining the duration, the following are relevant: (i) The nature of the parties’ relationship. (ii) The nature of underlying issue that gave rise to the family violence and whether this can be resolved. (iii) If the answer is yes, then the likely duration for resolving the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For instance, if there is evidence that the parties’ relationship can be restored and rebuilt, e.g. with the concurrent order of a counselling order, then a PPO with a fixed duration may be appropriate. For examples, see e.g., <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [62] and [63]; <em>WVK v WVJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31177-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 15</a> at [1] and [24]; <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a> at [2], [27] and [28]; <em>VDL v VDM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23972-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 138</a> at [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In the present case, there is no evidence to suggest that the Wife and Son need protection from the Husband for an indefinite period. The parties have been living apart since the 6 May incident and appear to be taking steps to end their marriage and go their separate ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_e\"></a>(e)     At the end of the divorce process, care, control and access relating to the Child – issues which have been the cause of conflict between the parties – will have been resolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Depending on whether the divorce and ancillary matters are contested or not, the process may take months to one/two years to complete.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Hopefully, by the end of two years, a PPO is no longer needed. However, if I am wrong, then the Wife can either apply to extend the PPO (under s 67 of the Charter) or apply for a fresh PPO, whichever is appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Finally, I come to the issue of costs. The Wife had asked for costs at $8,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In my view, costs order at $5,000 (in favour of the Wife) is more appropriate. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The trial is straightforward and lasted for only half a day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There were only two witnesses (i.e., the parties themselves).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The evidence and submissions are not voluminous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife’s counsel appeared only at the 3<sup>rd</sup> (last) mention and the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband would have asked for $5,000 in costs if he had succeeded in the trial.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Under the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”), a parent may be ordered to maintain his/her adult child if the latter “<em>would be</em> receiving instruction at an educational establishment”. S, a young adult, <em>plans to apply</em> for a course in a local university after his National Service (“<b>NS</b>”) ends in about two years’ time. Should S’s father be ordered to make payments to S, while he is still in NS, so that S can save up the money for the course? This is the issue in MSS No. 1404 of 2024 (“<b>MSS 1404</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the time of the hearing, the applicant (“<b>Son</b>”) (D.O.B.: 8 November 2002) was serving his NS. He planned to apply in February/March 2025 for a course run by the Singapore Institute of Technology (“<b>SIT</b>”). The outcome of such an application would only be made known in June/July 2025. If successful, the Son would commence the course only around August 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Son initiated MSS 1404 to compel the respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) to start paying $1,000/month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> while he is still in NS. The Son planned to use these payments to fund the SIT course (estimated at $30,000+). He commenced MSS 1404 because he believed that the Father had the funds and was concerned that they might be depleted when the course was due to start.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       During the hearing, the Father stated that he was surprised and “confused” by MSS 1404 – as the Son did not inform him of his plans to apply for an SIT course prior to the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       That said, the Father made it clear that he was fully prepared to pay the course fees. However, he was facing financial hardship at the material time, and he could start making the payments only from 2026 – i.e., when the course was expected to begin. The Father was prepared to tap into his monies in the Central Provident Fund (“<b>CPF</b>”) to pay the course fees. In this regard, he had about $240,000 in his CPF Ordinary Account – which would be more than enough to cover the fees. While he was prepared to pay the fees, the Father felt that his ex-wife (“<b>Mother</b>”) should be making contributions as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Governing provisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Section 69(2)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Son initiated MSS 1404 pursuant to s 69(2) of the Charter. According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court <em>may</em>, on due proof that a parent <em>has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance</em> for his or her child who is unable to maintain himself or herself, order that parent to pay monthly sums or a lump sum <em>for the maintenance of that child</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Section 69(5)(c)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       When applying s 69(2) to MSS 1404, it is essential to also consider s 69(5)(c) of the Charter. The latter provision states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The court <em>shall not make</em> an order under subsection (2) for the benefit of a child <em>who has attained 21 years of age</em> or for a period that extends beyond the day on which the child will attain that age <em>unless</em> the court is satisfied that the provision of the maintenance is <em>necessary</em> because –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the child is or will be or (if an order were made under subsection (2)) <em>would be</em> receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not while in gainful employment,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I pause to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For MSS 1404 to succeed, the Son must prove two things. <em>First</em>, that the payments which he is seeking qualify as “reasonable maintenance”. <em>Second</em>, that the Father has “neglected or refused” to provide the maintenance sought: s 69(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As the Son “has attained 21 years of age”, a court may order the payments sought <em>only if</em> he “would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment”: s 69(5)(c).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In applying s 69(5)(c), the following bears highlighting. <em>First</em>, the Charter does not specifically oblige a parent to fund his/her child’s tertiary education. <em>Second</em>, the obligation to provide maintenance under s 69(2) does not require a parent to pay for all the expenses of a child’s tertiary education: <em>UYT v UYU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25733-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 539</a> at [12] and [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Ultimately, a court retains the discretion under s 69(2) (“may”) whether to order a parent to pay for his/her child’s tertiary education expenses – and if so, (i) <em>how much</em> of such expenses the parent should bear and (ii) <em>when</em> the payments ought to begin.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In my view, the Son had failed to prove that the payments sought are both “reasonable” (s 69(2)) and “necessary” (s 69(5)(c)). These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Requested payments are neither “necessary” nor “reasonable”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <em>First</em>, the Son had failed to satisfy the legal requirement that he “<em>would be</em> receiving instruction at an educational establishment” in due course. At the time of the hearing, he had not even applied for the SIT course yet. In deciding whether to allow MSS 1404, I cannot assume (a) that the Son will apply for the course in 2025, or (b) that he will be admitted into the course in 2026 (if the application is made). Clearly, if the Son does not make the application or is unsuccessful, then it is <em>not necessary</em> to pay the course fees at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Second</em>, MSS 1404 is in effect a request for maintenance to be paid <em>in advance</em>. I am unable to locate a precedent where such maintenance has been ordered. In my view, it is wrong in principle to allow the Son’s request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Courts order child maintenance base on what a child <em>needs</em> and not what the child (or his/her parents) <em>wants</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     MSS 1404 is contrary to the above well-established principle. This is because its purpose is <em>not</em> to secure funds to meet the Son’s <em>current financial needs</em>. Instead, the purpose of MSS 1404 is to advance his <em>aspirational goal</em> – by establishing an education fund that he can tap on sometime in the <em>future</em>, if he is admitted into the SIT course.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The situation in the present case is similar to <em>UAP v UAQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21471-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 319</a>. In that case, the High Court wisely declined to order maintenance to cover the son’s tertiary fees. This is because at the time of judgement, the son “had not yet decided on his college choice”. In the circumstances, the High Court found that to order “a specific sum for [a child’s] tertiary education was too remote”: judgement at [98].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Third</em>, ordering the Father to pay maintenance in advance will create raise a host of issues – given that there is no certainty that the Son will be admitted into the SIT course. For instance, if his application for the 2026 enrolment is unsuccessful, what will happen to the payments already made? Is the Son supposed to hold onto them until he is admitted into the course? What if he is not admitted any time soon – or at all? There can still be complications even if the Son is admitted into the course. For instance, if the course fees turn out to be higher than expected, will the Son have to make another application to increase the amount of payable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Fourth</em>, it bears highlighting that child maintenance is a <em>shared</em> parental duty. In other words, both the Father <em>and the Mother</em> have a joint responsibility in supporting the Son’s course fees. In this case, the Mother was apparently working as a freelance renovation contractor. To determine what their respective contribution towards the fees should be, it is necessary for me to consider, among others, the Father’s and Mothers’ relative income, earning capacity and assets (“<b>financial position</b>”). In this case, while I had the Father’s financial position,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I did not know the Mother’s position. In the absence of such information, I have no basis to find that the Father should be solely responsible for funding the Son’s course fees – without any financial contribution from the Mother whatsoever.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s financial circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I now come to the Son’s submission that the Father has the available funds to make the requested payments. This submission is based photos posted online by the Father’s second wife (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Wife</b>”). They were apparently posted in June/July 2024 and show that she had a branded watch and bag, and was counting stacks of cash.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I am not persuaded by the Son’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, as shown in [10] above, the Son was unable to cross the legal threshold for ordering maintenance. He was also unable to show that his application for maintenance in advance is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the circumstances, the Son’s belief that the Father had sufficient funds is neither here nor there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, the Son did not adduce any evidence to show that the Father had the relevant funds at the time of the hearing. His belief that the Father had such funds was based on speculation – namely a watch, a bag and cash in the possession <em>of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife</em>. According to the Father, the watch and bag were bought several years ago – the watch in 2018 (by him) and the bag in 2019 (by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife). The Father added that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife and him kept their finances separate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the following evidence – which was not disputed by the Son – in fact shows that the Father was in dire financial straits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the time of the hearing, the Father was indebted to five banks and was on various repayment plans to discharge these debts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> According to the Father, these debts were incurred while running his construction business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       About one year before the hearing (i.e., in September 2023), the Father had traded in his 2021 Mercedes E Class (valued at about $400,000) for a 15-year-old Mercedes S Class (valued at about $50,000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father had not been timely in paying child maintenance (total: $2,500) for the Son and daughter, and would pay the arrears in sums of $3,000 and $5,000 when he could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Given the above, I accepted the Father’s submission that allowing MSS 1404 will add to his current financial hardship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For the above reasons, I dismissed MSS 1404.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the hearing, the Father did not express any anger towards the Son for having hauled him to court over MSS 1404. At all material times, he spoke tenderly to the Son. At the beginning of the hearing, the Father had in fact addressed the Son as “Dear” – before he quickly corrected himself and addressed the Son by his English name. From my observation of the Father, it is clear to me that he loved the Son dearly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     At the end of the hearing, the Father was visibly and genuinely sad that the Son had turned to the law to compel him to fund the SIT course. According to the Father, the Son had not called him for a long time, and the first time that he came to know of the latter’s intention to pursue an SIT course was on receiving MSS 1404. The Father teared when he stressed that he was prepared to help the Son – “not because the law says so” – but as a parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Son should remember the Father’s love and words. The law is a blunt tool and has its limits. Experience has shown that issues achieve better outcomes through honest and direct communication. Whatever may have been the reasons for the apparent lack of communication between the Son and Father, it is never too late to press the reset button.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In this regard, the Son’s aspiration to pursue tertiary education can be a good opportunity for him to reconnect with the Father. In my view, the Father sincerely wants to make the Son to be a better man than he is – including by providing the latter a tertiary education that he (the Father) did not have. I urge the parties to start communicating directly with each other.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>During the hearing, the Son stated that he was open to receiving a lower amount – at least $500/month to $600/month – if this is deemed more appropriate.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>This information is in the Father’s statement dated 10 September 2024 (exhibit R1).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Son’s statement dated 17 August 2024 at pages 127 to 131.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>For details, see Father’s statement dated 10 September 2024 (exhibit R1) at pages 24 to 34.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-10-14","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 388 of 2023 (Summons No 2244 of 2024)","title":"XEF v XEG","citation":"[2024] SGFC 92","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32457-SSP.xml","counsel":["Amelia Ang Yu Wen and Samantha Ee Hui Ying (Lee & Lee) for the plaintiff","Michael Chang (Sincera Law Practice LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-11-15T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XEF v XEG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEF <em>v</em> XEG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 92</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 388 of 2023 (Summons No 2244 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">14 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Amelia Ang Yu Wen and Samantha Ee Hui Ying (Lee &amp; Lee) for the plaintiff; Michael Chang (Sincera Law Practice LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XEF — XEG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">14 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SUM 2244/2024 (“SUM 2244”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. He was represented at the hearing by Mr Michael Chang (“Mr Chang”). The Wife was represented by Ms Samantha Ee (“Ms Ee”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the application on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       This is the brief procedural history of the action. The Wife had filed for divorce on 31 January 2023. Interim Judgment was granted on 28 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Given that parties had managed to reach an agreement on issues relating to the matrimonial assets and maintenance for the Wife, there were only two outstanding issues for the hearing of the ancillary matters: <b>a)</b> care and control of the children of the marriage, and <b>b)</b> child maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is against this backdrop that the Husband has taken out his application for discovery. There are four items to his application, and I shall deal with them in turn, applying the well-established principles relating to discovery in family proceedings (see <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Item 1 was a request for the Wife to disclose her unredacted bank statements for her accounts with OCBC and POSB for the period January to June 2024. At the hearing, Mr Chang clarified that his client was only seeking the Wife’s bank statements for January to March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ms Ee argued that her client should not be ordered to disclose the unredacted bank account statements. This was because only the deposits into the Wife’s accounts were relevant to the hearing of the remaining issues at the ancillary matters stage,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> specifically, the issue of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Child maintenance is ordered, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, including their parents’ financial means and resources: see <em>WSY v WSX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31484-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 21</a> at [103] citing <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [9]; <em>VLO v VLP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26219-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 68</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The deposits alone will not show the true extent of the Wife’s financial means and resources. It is also necessary to consider her expenditure. In that connection, there can be no quarrel that the unredacted statements are relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. I will therefore allow the request in Item 1, for the period January to March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I turn now to Item 2. This was a request for the Wife to provide her Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) Notice of Assessment (“NOA”) for the year 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Mr Chang argued, in written submissions, that the Wife’s NOA was relevant towards showing the true extent of the Wife’s financial means and her earning capacity. This had a direct bearing on the issue of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the other hand, Ms Ee argued that the Wife’s NOA was irrelevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters. This was because what the Husband really wanted was proof that the Wife had been receiving undisclosed rental income – the Wife’s NOA would not reflect such income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition to this, Ms Ee had also stated that although the IRAS NOA was irrelevant, her client was agreeable to producing the NOA provided the Husband did the same. Ms Ee said this was a “reasonable proposal”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and that the Husband could have avoided the need to seek the Wife’s NOA in discovery had he agreed to the Wife’s proposal in the first place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     However, as Mr Chang rightly pointed out, discovery cannot work in a “tit-for-tat” fashion. I had made similar observations in an earlier decision: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a>. I will add that, in the context of family proceedings, attaching conditions to the voluntary disclosure of documents in this manner may only serve to further increase acrimony between the parties – this runs contrary to the ideal of therapeutic justice that underpins our family justice system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Item 2 is, in my judgment, relevant and necessary to the issue of child maintenance as it will shed light on the Wife’s financial capacity and resources. I will therefore allow the request in respect of Item 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Item 3 was a request for the Wife to provide the tenancy and lease agreements, and the approval of the Housing and Development Board to rent out the bedrooms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Ms Ee’s argument was that disclosure of these documents should not be ordered as there is no <em>prima facie</em> evidence that these documents exist. The Wife’s position was that the rental was done on an informal basis and that there are no documents as proof of the rental.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I disallow the request in Item 3, but for different reasons than the ones which Ms Ee had given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     During the hearing, Mr Chang confirmed that Item 3 only had a bearing on the issue of child maintenance. In that vein, it is difficult to see how documents such as the tenancy and lease agreements, and HDB’s approval to rent out the flat, are relevant. These documents would not show the <em>extent</em> of any rental income that the Wife may have been receiving, and whether the Wife had indeed received such income. Even assuming that these documents are relevant, I do not think they are necessary to the disposal of the remaining matter of child maintenance given my orders for the Wife to disclose her unredacted bank statements and IRAS NOA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Item 4 was a request for the Wife to provide documents (such as invoices and receipts) in relation to the sum of $500 which had been paid to her POSB account on 29 December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife had asserted that this sum was repayment from a friend – she had allegedly paid for his carpark expenses which came up to $480. The Husband’s quarrel is that the Wife’s explanation must be untrue because the alleged expense of $480 does not tally with the repayment of $500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I disallow the request. If the Wife claims that the receipt of this sum was repayment for carpark expenses which she had borne for a friend, then it is for her to back up her assertion. In any event, I would add that the sum in question is a relatively modest one – the discovery process should not be used as a tool to ask that the other party to account for every single cent that had been spent or received.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of Items 1 and 2 (see above at [6] and [10]), whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her custody, power or possession, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife’s compliance affidavit is to be filed by 11 November 2024. The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Parties are to file their submissions on costs.

A perusal of the Relevant Messages revealed that on about <em>two occasions</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> sometime on or after 11 May 2024, the Husband had sent messages to the Wife with the following contents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Explicit messages which reminded the Wife of how the Husband had used to make her feel sexually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Offensive messages which asked the Wife whether another man (whom the Husband believed to be the Wife’s lover) liked “our videos” and whether the two of them had engaged in sex.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Images of the Wife in undergarments and engaging in sexual acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Offensive messages which described the Wife as a “cum dump” and her pictures as “viral porno”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6        <b><em>Messages relating to child access</em></b>. The Relevant Messages also contained messages from the Husband requesting to be given access, as well as photos/videos, of the daughters. There were also numerous “missed voice calls” and “missed audio calls” from the Husband on about <em>five days</em> – i.e., on or around 10, 18 and 19 May, as well as 10 and 11 June 2024. Presumably, these missed calls were in connection with the issue of child access as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband admitted to sending the Relevant Messages. He however contended that a PPO was not necessary as he did not intend to cause either the Wife or his daughters any harm. The Husband believed that the Wife had applied for a PPO to use as leverage in their custody battle for the daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other Alleged Incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For completeness, I wish to add that on the day of the trial, the Wife had wanted to admit evidence regarding several alleged incidents of family violence (“<b>Other Alleged Incidents</b>”) – from 2021 to 29 September 2024 – that were not documented in either (a) her complaint for PPO (“<b>C1</b>”) or (b) her “Attachment A” statement filed on 24 July 2024 for the purpose of the hearing (“<b>C2</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Some of the Other Alleged Incidents were allegedly witnessed by 3<sup>rd</sup> parties and were also recorded on video.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband objected to the reference to Other Alleged Incidents at the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     After considering the matter, I upheld the Husband’s objection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In my view, the Wife can always make a separate PPO application regarding these incidents, if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, it will be highly prejudicial to the Husband if he had to respond to the Other Alleged Incidents without being given any sufficient opportunity to prepare his case against them: <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [57]-[60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Requirements for PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that <em>family violence has been committed </em><b><em>or </em></b><em>is likely to be committed against a family member</em> and that <em>it is necessary for the protection of the family member</em>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold and italics added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On a plain reading of s 65(1), the Wife must prove two things on a balance of probabilities to obtain a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife must prove that the Husband had committed or is likely to commit “family violence” against the daughters and herself. (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> requirement</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife must also prove that a PPO “is necessary” for the protection of the daughters and herself. (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1<sup>st</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, the Wife had satisfied the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement for PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband admitted that he had sent the Relevant Messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     By sending the Relevant Messages and making multiple calls to the Wife, the Husband had committed acts which fall within limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter. This limb defines “family violence” as “causing <em>continual</em> harassment with intent to cause or <em>knowing</em> that it is <em>likely to cause anguish</em> to a family member” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband had sent the Wife messages and images that were sexually explicit and humiliating. Given the contents of the Relevant Messages and the frequency in which he attempted to call her, the Husband must have known that they were “likely to cause anguish” to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The next question is whether the Wife had also proved the 2<sup>nd</sup> requirement for PPO. In my view, the Wife had failed to do so. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons and circumstances of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In deciding whether a PPO “is necessary for the protection of the family member”, logically speaking, the reasons and circumstances in which the family violence is committed is an important consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This is evident from the fact that Parliament had specifically legislated for two circumstances where a PPO would not be appropriate. The first is where a respondent commits family violence while lawfully exercising his right in self-defence. The second situation is where the violence is committed by way of correction towards a child: see definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from the circumstances prescribed in s 64, there can be other situations where a PPO may not be necessary. One example is where the family violence is triggered by a respondent’s momentary loss of self-control due to persistent and deliberate <em>provocation</em> by the applicant: see e.g., <em>VYR v VYS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26982-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 128</a> at [44] and [45]. In such a case, the <em>cause</em> for the family violence is the <em>applicant</em> – not the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons for the Relevant Messages </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There were two reasons why the Husband had sent the Relevant Messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Sexually explicit messages</u>. At the material time, the Husband was very angry with the Wife for apparently having committed adultery while he was in a drug rehabilitation centre (“<b>DRC</b>”). It is clear from the messages that despite his anger, the Husband was prepared to forgive the Wife and reconcile with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Messages relating to child access</u>. After his release from DRC (where he was detained for several months), the Husband missed his daughters dearly and wished very much to see them. The Husband had sent the messages because of his perception that the Wife was denying him reasonable access to his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">PPO is not necessary to protect the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having considered the Husband’s reasons for sending the Relevant Messages, I found that the <em>risk</em> of the Husband committing family violence against the Wife is <em>very low</em> and that a PPO is thus unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband explained during the trial that he had sent the sexually explicit messages in “a moment of distress” – i.e., the unexpected realisation, after being released from DRC, that the Wife had apparently committed adultery. In my view, the circumstances that triggered such messages are unlikely to recur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is no evidence that the Husband had sent sexually explicit messages to harass the Wife either <em>before, or after</em>, the Relevant Messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Indeed, when considered in the wider context together with <em>other messages</em> between the parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> the Relevant Messages appear to an aberration in the Husband’s conduct. In all the other messages, the Husband had been very civil and reasonable towards the Wife. This was despite her having adopted an unfriendly tone in her messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, after the Relevant Messages, the Husband (i) had since accepted the fact that his marriage with the Wife had irretrievably broken down, (ii) is in the process of preparing for a divorce, and (iii) is now focussing his attention on securing reasonable access to his daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The issue now is whether the Husband would continue to harass the Wife over the child access issue. In my view, this is unlikely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Husband, he is placed on e-tagging until March 2025 and would be recalled to DRC if he were to get into trouble with the law. The Husband explained that he would not do anything to jeopardise his liberty and his custody battle for the daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I see no reason to disbelieve the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, I noted that since the sending of the Relevant Messages, the Husband had lawyered up. With the benefit of legal advice, the Husband is now aware of the boundaries of permissible conduct in securing access to his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">PPO is not necessary to protect the daughters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now turn to whether a PPO is necessary to protect the daughters. In my view, the answer is clearly no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As stated earlier, the Husband clearly loved his daughters. There is no evidence that he had committed prior acts of family violence against them. There is no reason why he would harm them in any way in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite his strong desire to see his daughters, it is clear to me that the Husband would not do anything that is against their interests – including putting them in a stressful situation. One of the clearest examples of this is the Husband’s message to the daughters’ school on 14 May 2024. In that message, the Husband specifically told the school that he had no intention to “defy [the Wife’s] wishes of keeping the children away” from him”. He added that the school should “carry on with [her] wishes as [he] value the children’s mental well-being during these troubling times and do not wish to interrupt their routine”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the above reasons, I dismissed the PPO application.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife’s “Documents and Evidence Checklist” dated 24 July 2024 (“<b>C2</b>”) at page 8 (12:05 pm to 1.11 am) and page 13 (1.12 am to 1.14 am).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>These incidents are described in exhibit <b>C3.</b></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>As stated earlier, the Wife had wanted to admit evidence regarding several alleged incidents of family violence allegedly committed by the Husband from 2021 to 29 September 2024 that were not documented in either C1 or C2.

I heard the application on 4<sup>th</sup> October 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties were married on 17 December 2008. Almost a decade later, they welcomed their first son into their family. Four years later, in 2021, their second son was born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The details as to how exactly the marriage broke down are murky, but what is clear is that the Wife filed for divorce on 19 June 2023. Interim Judgment was granted on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 2023 on the basis of the Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties then set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. It is in this context that the Husband had taken out SUM 2758. He was represented, at the hearing, by Mr Michael Han (“Mr Han”). The Wife, on the other hand, was unrepresented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the hearing, Mr Han highlighted that some of the documents sought had been produced by the Wife during mediation. The Wife, however, declined to produce those documents at the voluntary disclosure stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As I had pointed out to Mr Han, I did not think it was open to me to take this into account – whatever had been raised in mediation should remain in mediation. I thus proceeded to assess SUM 2758 on its merits, taking into account any documents which the Wife may have disclosed in her affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I shall deal first with the items relating to interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the hearing, Mr Han indicated that the Husband was no longer pursuing Items 4 and 5 of the interrogatories. As such, I will not deal with them. These were the remaining interrogatories that the Husband wanted the Wife to answer:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1    In whose name is the motor vehicle bearing the registration number of SNM xxx registered under.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">When was the motor vehicle purchased, how much is the outstanding loan, if any, what is the monthly instalment payments, and what is the current market value of the motor vehicle?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2    What are the surrender value(s) of the various insurance policies as listed therein? (with reference to paras 10(a) – (f) of the Wife’s AOM)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3    Whether the Plaintiff had invested in cryptocurrencies or any related investment of the same nature?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If yes, when were they purchased, the amount they were purchased for, what is the current balance/holdings and what is the market (trading) value of the investment(s)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6    Whether [X] has a company account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If yes, please provide details of the bank account number, balances and statements from January 2020 to August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife is the sole director-shareholder of [X], a company incorporated in Singapore that carries on a business as a travel agency. The interrogatories which the Husband pursues relates to information concerning the Wife’s assets and finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife does not dispute that she had not answered any of these interrogatories. Her real quarrel was whether she <em>should</em> have to answer them. She says that she should not have to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In my judgment, these interrogatories (above at [8]) are all relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. They go towards issues such as maintenance, determining the extent of the Wife’s assets and assessing which assets fell into the matrimonial pool, and the value of assets included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request for the Wife to answer the interrogatories as set out in Items 1, 2, 3, and 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I turn now to deal with the items relating to discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Item 1 was a request for the Wife to produce financial documents in relation to the company [X] of which she was the sole director. These included documents such as financial statements, the balance sheet, as well as all company bank account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The principles relating to the disclosure of company documents are set out in the decision of the High Court in <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery)</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194. In deciding whether to order disclosure, the court must consider whether the spouse has control over the company such that they are able to produce the documents sought: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the present case, the ACRA statement discloses that the Wife is the sole director and sole shareholder of [X]. It is clear that the Wife has control over the company such that she will be able to produce the documents that the Husband is asking for. I also add that these documents are certainly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters – they will allow the shares of [X] to be valued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I therefore allow the request in Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Item 2 was a request for the Wife to produce documentation relating to the insurance policies listed in her Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) and statements of their respective surrender values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Mr Han explained that while the Wife had, in her AOM, disclosed some documents relating to the insurance policies, those documents did not disclose their surrender values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I will allow the request in Item 2. These documents are relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would show, amongst other things, the surrender values of these insurance policies – this would have a bearing on issues such as the valuation of assets that are included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Item 3 was a request for official payslips from X for the period January to June 2024. Mr Han had narrowed the period of disclosure that the Husband was seeking, taking into account the fact that the Wife had already disclosed some of her payslips from X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I will allow the request in Item 3. The Wife’s payslips are certainly relevant and necessary to determining issues such as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Items 4 and 5 was a request for the following bank statements for the period April 2023 to June 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     POSB Everyday Savings Account ending -9;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     UOB One Account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Mr Han noted that the Wife had disclosed her statement in respect of both accounts for the month of May 2024. He clarified that the Husband was only seeking the Wife’s bank statements for April 2023 to June 2024, excluding the month of May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I will allow the request in Items 4 and 5. The bank statements are relevant and necessary in that they shed light on the Wife’s finances in the months leading up to the filing of the divorce and after the grant of the interim judgment. This would have a bearing on issues such as whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets, or maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Item 6 was a request for CPF transaction history for the past 1 year from April 2023 to June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I will allow the request. This document is indeed relevant and necessary. It will shed light on the Wife’s earning capacity (see <em>AAE v AAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/64155-M.xml')\">[2009] 3 SLR 827</a> at [19]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Item 7 was a request for the Wife’s Notice of Assessment from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) for the past 4 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I do not think the relevance and necessity of the Wife’s IRAS statements can be seriously disputed – it will go towards showing her income, and will have a bearing on issues such as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I will therefore allow the request in Item 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I come now to Item 8. This was a request for documents relating to a car allegedly belonging to the Wife. The Husband had pursued an interrogatory in relation to this car (see [8] above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I will allow the request in Item 8. The documents sought would go towards showing whether the car indeed belonged to the Wife, and the value of the said car, taking into account any loans and payments made towards insurance. This would have a bearing on issues such as determining the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall answer Items 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the interrogatories as set out in Annex A of SUM 2758, on affidavit, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Annex A of SUM 2758, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her custody, power or possession, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by the 8<sup>th</sup> of November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I shall hear parties on costs. Submissions on costs shall come in by way of letter, and shall be limited to a maximum of 3 pages each. This is to be done no later than 25 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It remains for me to thank Mr Han for his able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Claim dated 19 June 2023.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence","Family Law – Family Violence – Orders for protection"],"date":"2024-10-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 972/2024","title":"XEZ v XFA","citation":"[2024] SGFC 96","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32407-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in-person and unrepresented","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-11-08T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XEZ v XFA</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEZ <em>v</em> XFA </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32407-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 96</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 972/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">09 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in-person and unrepresented; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XEZ — XFA </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Orders for protection</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">9 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 972/2024 was the Wife’s application against the Husband for a personal protection order (“PPO”). The Wife also sought a PPO for her two sons: [A], who is 19 years old, and [B], who is 13 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over two days in the months of September and October. Having heard the evidence and considered the matter, I dismissed the Wife’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       To obtain a PPO, it is trite law that the applicant must prove the following two elements on a balance of probabilities (<em>CSW v CSX</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 204; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27616-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 47</a> at [26] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a>). First, that “family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961. As to what family violence is, that is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In addition to this, the second element an applicant must also establish is that the PPO is necessary for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife relies on the following two incidents in support of her application for a PPO for herself and her two sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The first incident took place on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 2024. This was the Wife’s evidence as to what had happened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On that day, the Wife realised that she had run out of condensed milk. The Husband said that he would give her money to buy some condensed milk. The Wife told her younger son, [B], to take the Husband’s card and she would head out to purchase a tin of condensed milk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife complained about having to go through so much difficulty to get some milk for her tea. She began to talk disrespectfully to the Husband. This provoked the Husband. He responded in a disrespectful manner, and also raised his hand in a fist towards her – though he did not hit her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband then angrily kicked a plastic vase. There was a remote control, amongst other items, in the plastic vase. The contents of the plastic vase scattered all over the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife called the police. They arrived on the scene and took their statements. The Wife explained that in the police statement, she had said that the remote control in the plastic vase had hit her – this was inaccurate – none of the items contained in the vase had hit her when the Husband kicked it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband’s evidence was materially the same. He explained that the Wife was kicking up a fuss over not being able to get condensed milk. The Wife had asked [B] to purchase a tin. The Husband told [B] that he did not have cash, and gave [B] his ATM card instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife was still unhappy. She continued to complain. Frustrated, the Husband confronted her. He pointed his finger at her and asked: “I give you money already why you still making noise”. In his anger, he kicked the plastic vase, but he did not see if anything had hit the Wife because it was dark. The Husband explained that he was angry because the Wife had kept nagging at him even after he had given [B] his ATM card to go buy some condensed milk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I had also heard evidence from [B] who had witnessed the quarrel between his parents. He said that he saw the Husband shouting at the Wife. He also said that he saw that the Husband looked like he was going to hit the Wife, but he did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to the second incident complained of. This took place on 13 September 2023. The Wife’s evidence was that she had gotten into an argument with the Husband over phone calls made by his family members. She said that the Husband’s family members had been asking about her visa status. She told the Husband to cut off all contact with his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband refused and shouted at her. A heated argument ensued. The Wife says that she could not bear being shouted at loudly and fainted. When she came to, she realised that she had been sent to hospital via ambulance. She told the doctors and nurses that she did not want to go back as she was afraid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife says that she did not want to create trouble for the medical staff. She asked to be discharged and went to the police station.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s evidence is, once again, materially similar. He said that there was a dispute between the two of them. The Wife was unhappy that he was still keeping in touch with his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     He had asked for the Wife’s brother to be present, so as to help mediate their dispute. The Husband said that the Wife kept nagging at him. He told her in a loud tone to wait – this caused the Wife to faint. His elder son, [A], called the ambulance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     [B] also gave evidence in relation to this incident. He said that he could not remember all that much, though he did see the Wife faint. He said that he called the ambulance, although the Husband had told him not to do so because it was not a serious issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In my judgment, the Husband had not committed any acts that fell within the definition of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 in both incidents that the Wife had complained of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In relation to the incident that took place on 16 May 2024, the Wife has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband had indeed raised a fist towards her during the course of their heated argument. I place little weight on her account of events that took place on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For one, there was a discrepancy between what the Wife had said in the police report dated 19 May 2024, and what she had subsequently said in her testimony. In that report, the Wife says that Husband had kicked the plastic vase – there was a remote in the plastic vase which flew out and hit her in the stomach. In her testimony during trial, however, the Wife stated that the remote control had never made contact with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It bears noting that this discrepancy is found in a police report made when the events were still fresh in the Wife’s mind. That there was such a discrepancy in the contemporaneous record of the incident cast doubt on the veracity of the tale which the Wife had told (for the general evidential value of a police report in the context of a PPO trial, see <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Compounding this was the fact that the Wife only clarified that the remote control never hit her when I had asked her about it. Prior to this, the Wife’s testimony had only focussed on what the Husband had allegedly done during the quarrel – which was to raise his fist towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I add that although [B] had given evidence that the Husband “looked like he was about to hit” the Wife, I do not place much weight on his evidence. Having seen [B] in person and heard his testimony, I cannot discount the fact that his recollection of events might have been influenced by the Wife – indeed the Husband had testified that the Wife was trying to alienate both his sons from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even taking the Wife’s case at its highest, and assuming that the Husband did raise his fist at her, this act would not, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence, specifically, limb (a) of s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (see above at [3]). The act complained of had taken place amidst a heated quarrel – if the Husband had indeed raised his fist, it was likely an expression of his frustration rather than an attempt to place the Wife in fear of hurt (to borrow the language of limb (a) of the definition of family violence in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife has thus failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an act of family violence committed towards her on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 2024. The Wife has also not shown that the Husband had committed an act of family violence towards either of his two sons – indeed, this incident merely concerned a quarrel between the Husband and the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I turn now to the second incident which took place on 13 September 2023. Again, the Wife has not shown that the Husband had committed family violence. It is undisputed that there was a heated quarrel between the both of them, and that the Wife had fainted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing whether there had been an act of family violence, it is also important to consider the context in which those acts took place. In the course of a heated argument, tempers may flare, and voices may be raised. This was, in my judgment, exactly what had happened during this incident that had taken place on 13 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Therefore, the Husband’s act of shouting, or raising his voice at the Wife in the course of a heated quarrel, when viewed in its proper context, does not constitute family violence as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I add that, given that neither of the two sons were involved in this incident, I do not find that the Husband had committed an act of family violence towards them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In addition, I also find that the Wife had not shown that family violence was <em>likely</em> to be committed on her, or her two sons. The two incidents complained of were, in my judgment, examples of disputes that may arise between couples. There was no evidence to show that the Husband was a violent or abusive man – indeed, the evidence pointed to the opposite conclusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For one, the Wife had given evidence that when [A] was in kindergarten, the Husband had hit him for leaving toys on the ground. She intervened and told the Husband to not hit their children. The Husband had listened and refrained from hitting them since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In this vein, the Wife’s own account was that she had a loving relationship with the Husband until her mother had passed away in 2019. She told me that she would work out her differences with her Husband by talking. She shared that while they had little in terms of material wealth, that was fine since they had each other and were able to make compromises. However, since her mother’s passing, she felt that the Husband’s own family was trying turn him against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Viewed in this light, the inference which I drew was that the Wife has had difficulty coping with, and moving on from her mother’s passing. She became increasingly paranoid – indeed, throughout her testimony and oral closing submissions, she emphasised repeatedly that the Husband’s family was trying to turn him against her, and that she did not have anyone else for support. Consequently, this changed the dynamic of her relationship with her Husband, giving rise to quarrels that formed the basis for her application for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Yet despite the currently strained relationship between the Wife and her Husband, I can find no evidence that the Husband had, or is likely to commit family violence. Indeed, the Wife has not, apart from the two incidents complained of, made any other allegations towards the Husband, nor has she put any other evidence before me to suggest that the Husband is indeed likely to commit family violence against her or her two sons. In other words, the Wife has simply failed to discharge her burden of proof (see above at [3]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Given that the Wife had not established the first requirement, that family violence had been, or was likely to be committed against herself, or [A] and [B], her application for a PPO must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I thus dismissed the Wife’s application in SS 972/2024 with no order as to costs.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of ancillary matters orders – Care and control – Section 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 – Material change in circumstances – Applicable considerations","Family Law – Variation of ancillary matters orders – Access – Drafting of clause that prohibits access being conducted in the presence of non-family members"],"date":"2024-10-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/D No. 1721 of 2023 (FC/SUM No. 2056 of 2024)","title":"XER v XES","citation":"[2024] SGFC 98","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32423-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Khin Wee (M/s I.R.B.

In the same year, interim judgement for divorce was entered and ancillary matters orders were made by consent in FC/ORC 5452/2023 (“<b>AM Order</b>”). Under the AM Order, the Mother was given care and control of the Daughter with access granted to the Father. The dissolution of the marriage was made final in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       About seven months after the AM Order was made, the Father sought to vary it in the following manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, to allow the Father to be the Daughter’s caregiver instead of the Mother. (“<b>Prayer 3</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If Prayer 3 was disallowed – then to vary the terms of the child access. <em>First</em>, by allowing the Father to carry out the access in the presence of non-family members. (“<b>Prayers 4 and 5</b>”) <em>Second</em>, by increasing the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to him for access. (“<b>Prayer 6</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       For completeness, the Father had also sought to vary the terms of the sale of the matrimonial flat under the AM Order (“<b>Prayers 1 and 2</b>”). However, by the time application came before me, the matrimonial flat had already been sold. As such, Prayers 1 and 2 were rendered moot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Governing provisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Prayers 3 to 6 are governed by s 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). That provision prescribes three circumstances in which orders on care and control as well as access may be varied. According to s 128 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody of a child on the application of any interested person, (1) where it is satisfied that <em>the order was based on (a) misrepresentation or (b) mistake of fact or (2) where there has been any material change in circumstances</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis and text in round brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Father relied on a “material change in circumstances” as the legal basis for Prayers 3 to 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       When applying s 128, it is essential to also note s 125(2) of the Charter. This provision sets out the <em>overriding</em> consideration when assessing whether a variation is appropriate:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, <em>the paramount consideration</em> is to be <em>the welfare of the child</em> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">What the Father must prove</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Given the above, the Father must prove the following for his application to succeed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there had been a “change in circumstances” since the AM Order was made in December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the change in circumstances is “material”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, Prayers 3 to 6, whichever is applicable, would better serve the Daughter’s welfare and interests than what had been provided in the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Outcome</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I made the following decision after considering the evidence and submissions:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"14.6%\"><col width=\"65.36%\"><col width=\"20.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Prayer</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Nature of application</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Outcome</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To switch the Daughter’s caregiver from the Mother to the Father.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Dismissed</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4 and 5</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To allow the Father to carry out the access in the presence of non-family members.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Allowed in part</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To increase the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to the Father for access.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Allowed in part</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 3</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I begin with Prayer 3. The Father submitted that there had been two material changes in circumstances since the AM Order was made, and that these changes necessitated the switch of the Daughter’s caregiver from the Mother to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The first material change involved his discovery of certain photos of the Daughter posted on social media.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Father, sometime in the last week of June 2024, he discovered on the Twitter feed of one “Anushka De Melo” a photo showing the Daughter “with her legs spread towards the camera and a suggestive ‘kiss’ emoji” covering her groin area (“<b>Offensive Photo</b>”). According to the Father, there were other photos showing the Daughter “lying in the arms of strangers including a man”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father submitted that the Mother had failed to protect the Daughter’s interests – <em>first</em>, by allowing others to take her photos in an inappropriate pose, and <em>second</em>, by failing to have these photos removed from online posts. According to the Father, “[t]here are many paedophiles and predators in the world and on internet, who will undoubtedly download and abuse these photographs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father submitted that the second material change in circumstances was the Mother’s efforts to frustrate his child access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father alleged that the Mother had handed the Daughter to his sister (“<b>Sister</b>”) as purported compliance with the access order. (This was despite the Mother knowing that the Father and the Sister were not on speaking terms.) As a result, he had to spend an additional 30 mins to travel to his parents’ house (where the Sister had brought the Daughter to) to see the child. Without consulting the Father, the Mother would also communicate directly with the Sister to make plans for the Daughter during the access times and to swap access dates.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father submitted that he should be made the Daughter’s caregiver since the Mother had deliberately interfered with his child access. He relied on <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (“<b><em>ABW</em></b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> to support this submission. In that case, the High Court affirmed the district judge’s decision to make the mother the caregiver because the children had grown estranged from her while under the father’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother submitted that there had <em>not</em> been any material change in circumstances since the AM Order was made in 2023. Her responses to the Father’s specific allegations were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>The photos</u> <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The photos were taken in 2020/2021. The Father had failed to prove that he had discovered them after the AM Order was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There was nothing sinister with the photos and online postings – (i) “Anushka De Melo” is a female relative, (ii) The photos were taken with the Mother’s family members, (iii) The Mother was present during the photo-taking, and (iv) The Daughter was comfortable with her photos being taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Frustration of child access</u> <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother did not act improperly in letting the Sister and other members of the Father’s family pick the Daughter up for child access. This was in accordance with a “long standing practice” between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There were occasions when the Father was late for – and even missed – contact time with the Daughter. The Mother was the one who reminded him about the access periods and events that he should be attending with the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother submitted that it would not be in the Daughter’s interests for the Father to be the caregiver:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother had all along been the Daughter’s primary caregiver. The Father, on the other hand, had never taken care of the child for extended periods of time by himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father was an unreliable parent. After the divorce, he had entrusted the responsibility of caring for the Daughter during access times to his parents and the Sister. Furthermore, the Father was often late for his contact times. Sometimes, he even missed them altogether. Additionally, the Father had breached the AM Order by leaving the Daughter alone with non-family members on two occasions while he attended to other matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had failed to disclose his plans for caring the Daughter if he were made her caregiver. For instance, he did not provide any information on (i) whether the Daughter would be staying with other tenants at his premises, (ii) whether she would continue to attend her current primary school, (iii) how the child would commute to school, and (iv) who would care for her if he was unavailable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If the Father were made the caregiver, he would likely cut off the Daughter from her. This was because he had proposed only “reasonable access” to the Mother – without stating the details of such access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To address the purported access issues raised by the Father, the Mother submitted that the proper approach should be to vary the <em>terms of child access</em> – not the care and control order. In support of this submission, she referred to the case of <em>VSL v VSM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 33</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Prayer 3 turned on whether the grounds raised by the Father come within the phrase “material change in circumstances” under s 128 of the Charter. As stated in [9] above, there are two parts to this phrase. <em>First</em>, that there has been a “change in circumstances”. <em>Second</em>, that the change is “material”. At this juncture, I pause to make some observations regarding these two parts of the phrase.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Change in circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On its plain meaning, “change in circumstances” can be understood as referring to a change in the conditions and facts that relate to and affect a situation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> A review of the cases shows that such a change typically involves –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A change in the circumstances <em>of the parents or the child</em>. For examples, see <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> at [26] and [27]; <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (“<b><em>AZB</em></b>”) at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A change in the parent-parent and parent-child <em>relationship</em>. For examples, see <em>VDX v VDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25522-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 2</a> at [25]; <em>ABW</em> at [29]; <em>AZB</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any other change that affects the workability or practicality of the care and control order. For examples, see <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> at [25]; <em>WCU v WCV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27450-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 38</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Material change</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Under s 128 of the Charter, the change in circumstances must be “material” before a variation is permissible. The word “material” is synonymous with “significant” and “substantial”. Thus, to qualify as a “<em>material</em> change in circumstances” under s 128, the change must be significant/substantial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It bears highlighting that courts have taken a “principled and pragmatic approach” in determining whether there has been a “material change in circumstances”. For instance, it has been held that such a change can be found to exist even if an applicant cannot pin-point “one particular identifiable event” that marks the time when the material change in circumstances has taken place: <em>AZB</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">“Discovery” of the photos</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having determined how the phrase “material change in circumstances” is to be understood, I return to the facts in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father submitted that the “discovery” of the relevant photos qualified as such a change.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I am unable to agree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25      <em>First</em>, I accepted the Mother’s submission that there were doubts regarding whether the Father had discovered the photos only after the AM Order was made. For instance, it was unclear whether he was a “follower” of “Anushka de Melo”, the person who had posted most of the photos – including the Offensive Photo. According to the Mother, this person was a relative. If the Father was a follower, then why did he not discover the photos earlier? If the answer is no, then how did he stumble across them? Did the Father discover the photos through a third party? If so, why did he not reveal that person’s identity was so that his evidence could be verified? It bears highlighting that (a) the belated discovery of the photos was an essential basis for Prayer 3, (b) the alleged discovery was mysterious, (c) the Father could easily have cleared the doubts, and (d) he had the burden to prove the alleged “change in circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26      <em>Second</em>, even if the Father did discover the photos after the AM Order, such a discovery did not come within the typical scenarios that have been judicially recognised as being a “change in circumstances”: see [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27      <em>Third</em>, the relevant photos were taken about three to four years <em>before</em> the AM Order was made. Put in another way, these photos were already in existence at the time of the order. To constitute a “change in circumstances”, the <em>change</em> must logically be something which had arisen only <em>after</em> the AM Order was made. A fact which had existed when the AM Order was made (i.e., the photos) – but was discovered thereafter – would not logically qualify as a change in circumstances. If authority is needed for this proposition, see <em>VWK v VWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27000-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 130</a> at [58]; <em>UKX v UKY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21579-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 31</a> at [15] and [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28      <em>Finally</em>, and in any event, I disagreed with the Father’s submission that by failing to have the photos removed from the posts of “Anushka De Melo”, the Mother had shown herself to be an irresponsible parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I did not find the relevant photos objectionable. They show the Daughter in family/relaxed settings. (According to the Mother, “Anushka De Melo” as well as the persons in the photos were all her relatives. I see no reason to doubt her evidence.) There is nothing sinister or lewd about the Offensive Photo. The person who posted it (a female) had clearly intended to use the emoji to protect the Daughter’s modesty, albeit in a cheeky way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite the above, the Father submitted that the photos ought to have been removed because “[t]here are many paedophiles and predators in the world and on internet, who will undoubtedly download and abuse these photographs”. I find this submission to be unreasonable. Going by the Father’s reasoning, then parents should not be posting their children’s photos on social media platforms, and those who do would be acting irresponsibly and unfit to be caregivers. This cannot be correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It bears highlighting that the photos were posted <em>years before</em> the Father commenced divorce proceeding. At the time of the AM Order in 2023, he had consented to the Mother being the Daughter’s caregiver. This clearly showed that from the time the photos were posted till the AM Order, there was nothing to suggest to the Father that the Mother was an irresponsible parent. Otherwise, he would not have agreed for her to be the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For the above reasons, I found that the Father’s “discovery” of the relevant photos did not constitute a “material change in circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alleged frustration of child access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I now turn to the Father’s second ground for varying the AM Order – i.e., his allegation that the Mother had been frustrating his child access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I found this allegation to be utterly devoid of merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father did not adduce any objective/contemporaneous evidence to support his bare allegation. If the Mother had been frustrating his child access, there would have been evidence of this, e.g., in WhatsApp messages between the Mother and him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, the Mother had adduced numerous WhatsApp exchanges between the Father and herself – from 2021 to May 2024 – which showed the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Mother had been <em>reminding</em> the Father about his contact time with the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Mother had been <em>proactively</em> informing the Father of the Daughter’s graduation ceremony and parent-teacher meetings and asking if he would be attending.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Mother had been messaging the Father <em>directly</em> to check who would be picking the Daughter from her residence for child access.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       There were occasions when the Father had arranged for the Sister or other family members to fetch the Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the Sister, the Father had not been exercising his access rights regularly. There were occasions when he had left it to his parents and her to care for the Daughter during the access periods.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given my factual finding that the Mother did not frustrate his child access, the Father had failed to prove that there had been a “material change in circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Switch of caregiver against the Daughter’s interest</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For completeness, I wish to add that the Father had also failed to prove that he would be a better caregiver for the Daughter than the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I accepted the Mother’s submissions in [16(a)] to [16(c)] above that making the Father the caregiver would in fact be against the Daughter’s interests. This is because these submissions are supported by contemporaneous WhatsApp messages, the Sister’s evidence, and/or are not disputed by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Additionally, I had also considered the following which favoured maintaining the status quo of the Mother being the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From the evidence, the Mother had clearly shown greater concern, interest and responsibility for the Daughter than the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Daughter had been enjoying a stable home environment under the Mother’s care. Despite the divorce, the Daughter had been able to maintain a healthy relationship with her paternal relatives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being: <em>ABW</em> at [20] and [21]. If the Father was made the caregiver, the Daughter would be uprooted from a familiar caregiver and home environment – without any evidence that the Father would (i) be able to take better care of her or (ii) be available when she needs him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, it was clear from the WhatsApp messages that the Mother was committed to ensuring a healthy relationship between the Daughter and the Father. There is no similar evidence from the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     For the above reasons, I dismissed Prayer 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I now come to the Father’s alternative application, i.e., for the terms of his access in the AM Order be varied. The Father requested two variations to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayers 4 and 5 </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s position<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The first variation involved deleting from the AM Order the following condition to child access:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> (“<b>non-family members clause</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father submitted that the deletion was needed so that he could get “unfettered access” to the Daughter and to prevent the Mother from interfering with his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To show that the non-family members clause was unduly restrictive, the Father gave the examples of him bringing the Daughter to a McDonald’s fast-food outlet or to a tuition centre. According to him, such conduct would be in breach of the clause. This was because there would be strangers (non-family members) at these places.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s position<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother objected to the deletion of the non-family members clause. She submitted that the Father had failed to prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, that there had been a material change in the circumstances since the making of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, that the Mother had used the non-family members clause to refuse to hand over the Daughter to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, that the deletion of the clause would be in the Daughter’s welfare. The Mother was worried for the Daughter’s safety during access periods. She felt that the non-family members clause would prevent the Father from leaving the child alone with strangers, especially unknown men.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, the Mother was prepared to be flexible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She recognised that the Father was in a serious relationship with another woman (“<b>partner</b>”) and intended to marry her eventually. In the circumstances, she appreciated that it would be in the Daughter’s interests to have a relationship with the partner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, the Mother was prepared to give her consent for other non-family members to be present during the access periods on the condition that the Father (i) informed her of the location of his access, (ii) provided details regarding the other people who would be present, and (iii) allowed her to contact the Daughter during such access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Given the above, the Mother counter-proposed that the non-family member clause be varied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Save for the Plaintiff’s romantic partner</u>, the <del>The Plaintiff’s</del> access shall not be in the presence of non-family members, <u>unless the Plaintiff obtains the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties have valid concerns</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Father found the non-family members clause to be unduly restrictive and impractical. The Mother was worried for the Daughter’s safety during access periods. I found these concerns to be genuine and reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my view, the Father’s request to delete the non-family members clause entirely – without introducing any safeguards whatsoever – would only heighten the Mother’s concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mother’s proposed variation </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     With a view to an amicable resolution, the Mother had proposed a variation of the non-family members clause to address the Father’s concern. Under her proposed variation –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father could conduct the child access in the presence of his partner without seeking her prior consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Father wanted to conduct the child access in the presence on other non-family members, then the Mother’s prior consent in writing must be sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother deserved commendation for showing flexibility in coming up with her proposed variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issues with the proposed variation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     That said, I found that the Mother’s proposal did not go far enough. This is because under her proposed variation, the Father must seek her prior consent in writing if he wishes to bring the Daughter to fast-food outlets, playgrounds, shopping malls – and even HDB lifts and female toilets (should the need arises). In my view, it would be impractical for both parties if prior consent in writing had to be sought and provided in such circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Additionally, the Mother’s proposed variation can also unwittingly create more instances where misunderstanding and friction between the parties could arise – e.g., if the Mother is not able to see the Father’s request for consent, or give her consent, in good time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughter’s safety is the paramount consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It cannot be doubted that the Daughter’s safety is the paramount consideration. In my view, this becomes an issue if the Father were to (a) leave the child unattended, (b) place her in the care of non-family members (especially strangers), or (c) bring the child to places which do not serve her interests or welfare (e.g., a function organised by the Father’s friends/colleagues or a night establishment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Variation ordered</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Based on the above considerations, I varied the non-family members clause as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>ii</u>)    <u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[variation in underscore]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In my view, the above variation would allow the Father to carry out child access in the presence of non-family members in the following circumstances:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"57.74%\"><col width=\"42.26%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s prior written consent </b> <b><u>not </u></b> <b>needed</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s prior written consent needed</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(1) The Father’s partner</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Circumstances that do not fall within (1) and (2)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(2) Circumstances in [40] and [48] above</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In coming up with the clause in [51] above, I have sought to avoid the dangers of being over prescription.

This involved adding the following text at the end of clause 1(h) of the AM Order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That all of the Plaintiff’s access aforesaid shall be by way of –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    The Child’s arrival at the Plaintiff’s residence;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    By the Plaintiff picking up the Child directly; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    In any other manner as agreed by the Plaintiff personally and conveyed to the Defendant in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father’s intent behind the variation was to increase the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to him for access.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother’s position regarding the requested variation was as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.27834433113377%\"><col width=\"29.5140971805639%\"><col width=\"62.2075584883023%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father’s requests</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s position</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">For the Daughter to “arrive” at the Father’s residential address </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(“<b>Option 1</b>”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) It would not be feasible for the Daughter to expend time and energy to travel to an address specified by the Father for access. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) Instead, it would be more comfortable for the Daughter if the Father picked her up in his car.

It was not disputed that in practice, such handover typically took place at the Mother’s residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In my view, the Father’s formulation of the requested variation is problematic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother had objected to Option 1 as being not feasible for the Daughter. I found her objection to be reasonable. Due regard ought to be given to the Mother’s objection given that there was already an established manner of handover (i.e., at the Mother’s residence).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It bears highlighting that the three options for handover are all in the alternative (“or”). There is <em>no “default” mode</em> of handover among these options.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Furthermore, the Father’s formulation did not specify <em>which party</em> – i.e., whether the Father or the Mother – would be responsible for confirming the applicable mode on each occasion of handover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Given (b) and (c) above, there will be <em>a lot of uncertainty</em> each time the Daughter is to be handed over to the Father for access. Such uncertainty can result in anxiety and inconvenience to the parties. These concerns are real – especially when that the Father has a history of giving <em>last minute notices</em> to the Mother to delay or cancel the handover due to his work commitments. The uncertainty arising from the Father’s formulation of the requested variation can lead to misunderstanding, frustration and accusations between the parties – which can in turn affect the Daughter. This is not in the child’s interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I accepted the Mother’s proposed variation in [57] above. In my view, it covers all the three options of handover requested by the Father – and thus strikes the right balance between flexibility and certainty regarding the manner of the handover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To sum up, my decision is as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"25.14%\"><col width=\"74.86%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Application</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Decision</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Prayer 3</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Dismissed</b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Mother shall continue to be the Daughter’s caregiver.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Prayers 4 and 5</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Allowed in part</b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The last sentence in clause (1)(a) and clause 1(d)(i) of the AM order are varied as follows:</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii)     <u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[variation in underscore]</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Prayer 6 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Allowed in part</b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The following clause is to be added at the end of clause 1(h) of the AM Order:</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Plaintiff shall pick the Child up prior to his access and drop the Child off at the end of his access at the Defendant’s place of residence, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Before concluding, I wish to state that during the proceedings, the Father had largely stuck to his positions and did not make much effort to address the Mother’s concerns arising from his application.

They had a child, who was nine years of age. They fell out and filed for divorce. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in January 2023. I divided the matrimonial assets 75:25 in favour of the husband, granted the husband the sole care and control of the child, and granted the wife generous access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The wife has filed an appeal against these decisions. I now provide my reasons for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The husband was a citizen of Romania and a permanent resident of Singapore. The wife was a citizen of Singapore. They married in 2013 and had the child in 2015. Apart from a year between 2017 and 2018, when the family moved to Europe, the family lived in Singapore throughout the marriage. After the family returned to Singapore in 2018, they lived in rented apartments. At the time of these proceedings, the matrimonial home was a rented apartment in the east of Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In July 2022, the relationship between the spouses broke down. The spouses began sleeping in separate bedrooms even as they continued to reside in the matrimonial home. They split their time with the child on the weekends, with the husband having the care of the child on Saturdays and the wife having the care of the child on Sundays. But the matrimonial relationship deteriorated further, and the spouses commenced divorce proceedings in August 2022. They split their time with the child further: each parent had the care of the child on alternate days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2022, the spouses agreed to share the custody of the child following their divorce. This agreement was recorded as a consent order of the Family Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In January 2023, interim judgment of divorce was granted on the facts that each spouse had behaved in ways that made it unreasonable to expect the other spouse to continue to live with him or her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In July 2023, the wife moved out of the matrimonial home and took the child with her. They moved into another apartment within the same residential development as the matrimonial home. The husband continued to live in the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       A court in dividing matrimonial assets was tasked with justly and equitably apportioning the economic fruits of the marriage between the former spouses (see <em>VIG v VIH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25105-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 16</a> at [35]). In discharging that task, the court would first identify the assets (and liabilities) that constituted the pool of matrimonial assets then value those assets (and liabilities) to determine the economic fruits of the marriage. Having done so, the court would divide these economic fruits between the spouses based on their financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage, in line with the philosophy that marriage was an equal partnership (see <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL v TNK</em>”) at [45]). To give effect to that philosophy, “mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership” (see <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Identification of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Here, there were no assets that were held by the spouses jointly. The only relevant assets (and liabilities) were thus those that were held by each spouse solely in his or her name (or jointly with non-parties to the marriage). I list these assets and the positions of each spouse on the values of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Based on these submissions, there were four main areas of disagreement between the spouses. These were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the value of the husband’s DBS and OCBC (Bonus+) accounts and wife’s DBS account that were in each of their sole names;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the status of the wife’s DBS account that she held jointly with her mother and the value of the account if it was a matrimonial asset;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the status of the wife’s watches and the value of the watches if they were matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the status of the wife’s debt to her aunt and the value of the liability if it was a matrimonial liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Bank accounts in sole names of husband and wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The divergence between the spouses over the value of the bank accounts concerned the date on which those bank accounts were valued. The husband valued those bank accounts as of the date of the interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, January 2023). The wife valued those bank accounts as of the date of these proceedings on the ancillary matters (<em>ie</em>, April 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [1], Choo Han Teck J observed that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets was typically the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. Nevertheless, bank account balances and Central Provident Fund account balances were be valued as of the date of the interim judgment. For such money accounts, the economic fruits of the marriage were the monies in the accounts rather than the accounts themselves. The quantum of the monies that represented the fruits of the marriage crystallised at the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. In consequence, except for run-of-the-mill expenses, sums expended by a spouse from these money accounts between the interim judgment and the hearing of the ancillary matters had to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets if the other spouse had a putative interest in the monies and had not consented to the expenditure (see <em>TNL v TNK</em> at [24]). Specifically, a spouse was not entitled to use matrimonial money to fund his or her legal costs, which were not daily or run-of-the-mill expenses (see <em>WTS v WTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32208-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 33</a> at [8]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I thus preferred the values put forward by the husband on these accounts: $239 for the DBS account in the name of the husband, $129,339 for the OCBC (Bonus+) account in the name of the husband, and $55,452 for the DBS account in the name of the wife. I also agreed with the husband that the matrimonial assets in his name had a value of $455,629.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Joint account between wife and her mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The husband submitted a DBS bank account that the wife owned jointly with her mother and that had a balance of $7,980 as of the date of the interim judgment was a matrimonial asset. The wife did not deny the existence of this bank account but suggested that she had no beneficial interest in the monies therein and/or that her mother was the beneficial owner of those monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As a joint owner of the bank account, the wife was entitled to the undivided whole of the monies in that account. Those monies were thus matrimonial assets. Insofar as the wife asserted that she had no beneficial interest in the account, it was incumbent on her to obtain a determination from the civil courts to that effect because the Family Court was unable to adjudicate on a claim by a third party to a putative matrimonial asset (see <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]). But there was no such determination before me. Nor was there any objective evidence to show that, despite her legal interest in the monies in the monies in that account, she had no beneficial interest in the monies in that account. I thus included that account in the pool of matrimonial assets and valued it at $7,980.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Watches of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The husband submitted that the wife owned two Longines watches and valued them at $4,721 based on their purchase prices. The wife did not dispute her ownership of these watches and did not offer any estimate of the value of these watches. The value of these watches, even if objectively modest, was not insubstantial relative to the value of the other matrimonial assets. I thus included these watches within the pool of matrimonial assets and valued them at $4,721.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">$100,000 debt of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The wife submitted that she owed $100,000 to her aunt, which debt was a matrimonial liability that had to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. She claimed that she had been compelled to borrow that sum in November 2022 because the husband had stopped maintaining her since February 2022. The husband disputed these claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The aunt deposed an affidavit in support of the claim that the wife had incurred a $100,000 matrimonial liability by borrowing that sum from her. The aunt added that she had loaned a total of $160,000 to the wife in two tranches: $100,000 on 17 November 2022 and $60,000 on 10 July 2023. The aunt exhibited a document dated 28 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> in which the wife “confirm[ed] and acknowledge[d]” a loan of $160,000 from the aunt. The aunt described this document as a “Debt Acknowledgement Note”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I placed little weight on this affidavit. Although the affidavit exhibited a bank statement that recorded a $100,000 disbursement from the aunt to the wife on 17 November 2022, it contained no contemporaneous documentation of any liability on the part of the wife in respect of that disbursement. The Debt Acknowledgement Note, which was the only document that purported to record an obligation to repay that disbursement, was created only eight months later. This record was belated, convenient, and self-serving. The aunt deposed that she had not procured a formal “loan agreement” on or around 17 November 2022 because there had been a “common understanding” of repayment and because the wife was “family”. But this claim sat uneasily with her procurement of such a formal “loan agreement” after the subsequent $60,000 disbursement. Indeed, up until 10 July 2023, which was the date of that $60,000 disbursement, the correspondence between the wife and the aunt did not reflect any expectation of repayment of the $100,000 disbursement or the $60,000 disbursement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Only on 28 July 2023, which was two weeks after the $60,000 disbursement did the wife sign the Debt Acknowledgement Note. It was thus unlikely that the $100,000 disbursement had created a liability on the part of the wife to the aunt. It was more likely that the $100,000 had been disbursed to the wife without any expectation of or obligation for its repayment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The absence of detail beyond the Debt Acknowledgement Note on how and when the $100,000 disbursement was to be repaid reinforced this conclusion that it had been made without any obligation for its repayment. Moreover, the Debt Acknowledgement Note itself was equivocal on any such repayment obligation. Therein, the wife simply stated that the monies “will be repaid when my parents sell their current house and manage to get the cash on hand, or a partial repayment may be paid earlier by myself the moment I am able to do so.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Such an equivocal undertaking fell short of establishing a liability of $100,000 on the part of the wife to the aunt. I was thus unable to include any such liability in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Valuation and division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Given my findings above, the value of the matrimonial assets in the name of the husband was $455,629 while the value of the matrimonial assets in the name of the wife was $71,815. Accordingly, in the aggregate, the value of the pool of matrimonial assets was $527,444.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     There was little dispute that for most of the marriage, the husband was the breadwinner while the wife was the homemaker. Further, the husband had given the wife a monthly allowance of $1,000 up until the wife found employment as a financial advisor in 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The wife admitted that the husband had financed the bulk of the matrimonial assets but claimed a 30% share of them based on her indirect contributions to their acquisition. She argued that pursuant to the structured approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em>, the direct contributions were 100:0 in favour of the husband, the indirect contributions were 40:60 in favour of herself, and the final ratio was thus 70:30 in favour of the husband. She submitted in the alternative that insofar as the marriage was a single-income one and <em>ANJ v ANK</em> did not apply, she should receive 25–35% of the matrimonial assets on the authority of <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (“<em>BOR v BOS</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The husband submitted that the matrimonial assets should be divided 80:20 in his favour. He explained that he had been more than just a breadwinner and had helped to care for the child while working a full-time job. He added that he had even taken on primary caregiving responsibilities in addition to his breadwinning role in the later years of the marriage, when the wife was focusing on embarking on a career in financial advisory services. He alleged too that the wife had in those later years of the marriage embarked on extra-marital affairs that compromised her homemaking and her care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In my judgment, this marriage was substantially a single-income marriage with the husband as the breadwinner and the wife as the homemaker. Even if the wife had started work as a financial advisor at the time of the divorce, that period of work was insignificant in the context of the nine-year marriage. The approach to the division of matrimonial assets in single-income marriages as set out in <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>BOR v BOS</em> was thus the appropriate one to take. Thereunder, the weight to be ascribed to indirect contributions would be proportionate to the length of the marriage. Hence, the final ratios of division ranged from 50:50 (in long single-income marriages of 25–35 years’ duration) to 75:25 in favour of the breadwinner (in shorter single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration). I reproduced the observations in <em>BOR</em> at [111]–[113].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">111    … In <em>TNL v TNK</em>, this court observed that the trend in long single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but different considerations may attach to short single-income marriages (at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <em>TNL v TNK</em> itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112    The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <em>TNL v TNK</em>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">113    We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <em>ATT v ATS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0859.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 859</a> at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <em>UGG v UGH (m.w.)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 25</a>, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <em>ABX v ABY and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0969.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 969</a>, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Here, the marriage was a short one of only nine years. For most of it, the husband had been the breadwinner while the wife had been the primary caregiver for the child. Yet the husband had, over and above his breadwinning, made significant indirect contributions to the family especially in the later years of the marriage. In the words of the wife, “Overall, the [husband] had indeed been a supportive spouse during those years prior to the Divorce Proceedings, for which I am grateful and I fully acknowledge”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> By contrast, as the wife recorded in her diary, she sent text messages to her male companion(s) “all the time”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and “g[a]ve up my time with my son” for those companion(s).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To be clear, I made no finding on the allegation that the wife had embarked upon extra-marital affairs. The grounds of this divorce were that the behaviour of each spouse had made it unreasonable to expect the other to continue to live with him or her (see [6] above). It was thus unnecessary to make any finding on extra-marital affairs here. The diary entries of the wife were relevant only insofar as they showed the time and energy that the wife had spent other than on her role as a full-time homemaker. Still, those expenditures of time and energy were extensive and would have distracted the wife from her homemaking duties. Taking account too that this marriage spanned only nine years, the indirect contributions of the wife were at the lower end of that of homemakers in single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration as set out in <em>BOR</em> (see [25] above). A just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets was thus 75% to the husband and 25% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child custody, care and control, and access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The spouses had since December 2022 agreed to share the custody of the child. They had also agreed to jointly make all applications for “Citizenship, Permanent Residency, Long Term Visa and/or any other immigration-related documents (save for travel visas) in any other jurisdiction on behalf of the Child” (see [5] above). I thus made no further order on the custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Each spouse sought the sole care and control of the child for the immediate future, even as the wife suggested that they could share the care and control of the child when the child was older. The wife submitted that she had been the primary caregiver for the child, particularly in the years after the child was born and in the months after the breakdown of the marriage. The husband agreed that the wife had been the primary caregiver for the child after the child was born but submitted that he had become the primary caregiver in the final years of the marriage when the wife was focused on embarking on a financial advisory career. He added that the fact that the wife was the primary caregiver for the child after the breakdown of the marriage should be disregarded because that was a <em>status quo</em> that the wife had engineered by removing the child from his care and depriving him of access to the child thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, each spouse had played an active role in the upbringing of the child, and the continued involvement of both parents in the care of the child conduced to the best interests of the child. Nevertheless, the spouses were adamant that an order of shared care and control would have been unworkable in the immediate future due to the animosity between them, and I saw no reason to disagree with this position. Hence, the interests of the child were best served by placing the child in the care and control of the parent that would best promote the co-parenting of the child. As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [82], “it is in a child’s best interests post-divorce for him to maintain a good relationship with both his parents.” Accordingly, “[t]he court, in deciding which parent to award care and control to, therefore generally takes into account the extent to which the prospective carer will maintain and facilitate the child’s relationship with the other parent.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At the outset, I placed little weight on the <em>status quo</em> that had arisen following the breakdown of the marriage, where the wife had been the primary if not the exclusive caregiver for the child. This was an artificial situation where the husband had been substantially excluded from the care for the child even as he lived in the same residential development as the child. At all times, the husband had been ready and willing to care for the child and would have cared for the child had he been permitted to do so. As the Family Court held in <em>UGO v UGR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20965-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 125</a> at [46], the significance of continuity of care in deciding the care and control of a child was diminished when the <em>de facto</em> non-care parent had been deprived of the opportunity to care for the child, especially when that <em>status quo</em> had been unilaterally created by the <em>de facto</em> care parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On the evidence, placing the child in the care and control of the husband would conduce to the co-parenting that promoted the best interests of the child. Even as the wife had cared for the child, she was prone to emotional instability that had hurt the child. In her diary, she lamented: “It’s getting harder to control my frustrations on long days and especially when I’m tired”, “I find myself saying certain things which I know aren’t good for him”, “I need to really ensure that I control my temper … The damage done to his self-esteem just ain’t worth it”, and “Maybe there is something wrong with me after all”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> These laments corroborated the claims of the husband that the wife would, when frustrated, taunt, scream, and hit child. These laments were also not inconsistent with the claims of the husband that the wife would make “racist, xenophobic and other insensitive remarks” about the Romanian heritage of the husband in front of the child that were “harmful for the Child’s esteem and identity since he is half-Romanian himself”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The husband deposed, and wife did not deny, that she would call him a “gypsy”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and a “foreigner” who should “go back home”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The text messages exchanged between the husband and the wife showed just as much. As much as the laments of the wife about her behaviour revealed her recognition of its adverse impact on the child, it was hardly reassuring for the purpose of care and control that she took few steps beyond such lamenting to improve her management of her emotions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Further, the male companionship that the wife enjoyed alongside her homemaking compromised her time with and care of the child. As she diarised, she communicated with her male companions “all the time”, left the home to meet them “impromptu”, and even had to “give up my time with my son” for them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He is back in SG today.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And texted me at 9am. 9.30am to be precise. Turns out that he wanted to meet me today! omg. I was definitely not expecting to meet him today, and for sure not expecting him to want to meet me either! I think he must really miss me gosh. :) :) :)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He was worried he would be tired and hence didn’t dare to commit, and wanted to surprise me instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(Night time now)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Found out why it was so impromptu that he wanted to meet – he got home and could not sleep. And his requests for me to <em>meet him and give up my time with my son</em> was just because he could not sleep due to jet lag. How disappointing. I had expected better and looks like I will be his social escort and pretend to be happy :)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Most worryingly, the wife appeared to have since July 2023 unilaterally removed the child from the care of the husband and neglected to facilitate the co-parenting that would have been in the best interests of the child. Still, she claimed that she had encouraged the child to spend time with the husband. She clarified that the husband had from July to September 2023 accompanied the child to and/or from school three to five times each week and spent “reasonable amount of time” with the child “for breakfast, showering, dinner, showering and settling down”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She added that despite her differences with the husband, she “kept a limited channel open with the Husband via Whats[A]pp for the sake of [the child]” by “unblock[ing] the Husband at specific times of the day to allow for communication on essential matters”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> But these clarifications showed that the child had scarce opportunity to spend time with the husband for meaningful durations. These clarifications showed too that the wife had, after seizing the <em>de facto</em> care and control of the child, insisted on parenting the child on only her terms and was unamenable to co-parenting the child with the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In comparison, the husband had despite his differences with the wife taken steps to ameliorate those differences and to promote the bond between the child and the wife. After discovering the time and energy that the wife had spent on male companionship outside the marriage, the husband went for therapy to manage his emotions and learn to co-parent the child despite the breakdown in the marital relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He maintained good terms with the relatives of the wife and encouraged the child to meet with them. Even after the wife removed the child from the matrimonial home in July 2023, he worked with the wife to ensure that the child was fed, washed, and clothed. The wife painted these interactions as her facilitation of access between the husband and the child. Yet these interactions were equally the product of the husband adjusting his schedule and working around the schedule of the wife to ensure that the needs of the child were not compromised, especially when the work and other commitments of the wife took her away from the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed: “switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent.” These observations were apposite here, where the <em>status quo</em> was the wife as the <em>de facto</em> care parent of the child. This <em>status quo</em> complicated the co-parenting of the child by interfering with the bond between the child and the husband. Placing the child in the care and control of the husband, who was a capable parent that placed the interests of the child before his differences with the wife, would facilitate the co-parenting that conduced to the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I was confident that any ensuing disruption to the <em>status quo</em> here would not prejudice the child for three reasons. First, the duration of the <em>status quo</em> was short: less than a year had elapsed since July 2023. Second, the husband had been immersed in the care of the child up until July 2023 and accompanied the child to and/or from school and over “breakfast, showering, dinner, showering and settling down” up until September 2023. Third, the husband had a viable plan to care for the child from day to day: his flexibility in his job enabled him to take care of the child when the child was not at school while his proposal to rent an apartment with multiple bedrooms near the child’s school would provide the child with a dedicated bedroom, study area, and play area. This would be more conducive for the child, who was a soon-to-be teenager, than sharing a room in an apartment with the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I thus placed the child in the sole care and control of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     To preserve the relationship between the wife and the child, I made generous orders for her access to the child. These orders were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife shall have access to the child on one day each weekend, and this day of access will alternate between Saturdays and Sundays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The wife shall have access to the child on half of the child’s school holidays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife shall have access to the child on all gazetted public holidays from 0930hrs to 2000hrs, other than on public holidays falling within the husband’s share of the school holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The wife shall have access to the child on the child’s birthday on every alternate year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To facilitate these access orders, I ordered the wife to pick the child up from and drop the child off at the residence of the husband for each access session. For the avoidance of doubt, I specified that the wife was free to travel with the child during her access sessions during the child’s school holidays. When the wife had communicated her travel plans to the husband, the husband was to provide the passport of the child to the wife seven days in advance of the departure date and the wife was to return the passport of the child to the husband three days after the return date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     To allow each parent to bond with the child when he or she did not have the physical care of the child, I also granted each parent virtual access to the child as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife shall have virtual access to the child three times each week, with the husband to facilitate such access; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband shall have virtual access to the child three times each week during the wife’s half of the school holidays, with the wife to facilitate such access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In my view, these orders would grant the wife the space to adjust to her new job as a financial advisor and work on managing her emotions without the responsibility of caring for the child from day to day. To that end, the fact that she had acknowledged that her expressions of frustration at the child had adversely impacted the child (see [32] above) was a good start. After she had settled into her new role as a financial advisor and gained the tools to manage her emotions are frustrations, it was open to her to apply for a variation of these care and control and/or access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The wife did not seek any order of maintenance for herself. I therefore declined to order the husband to maintain the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Given my decision to place the child in the sole care and control of the husband, I was not inclined to make any order of maintenance in respect of the child. The income of the husband dwarfed that of the wife. Based on their latest Notices of Assessment, the husband earned $174,900 per annum (or $14,575 per month) while the wife earned $34,956 per annum (or $2,913 per month). The husband was well able to maintain the child on his own. It was neither just nor equitable to order the wife to maintain the child, especially when she was finding her feet in her new job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Speaking extra-judicially, Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, Presiding Judge, Family Justice Courts, recently reiterated that parents working together, and not the court, were the best persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child (see “From Confrontation to Collaboration: A Decade in Transforming The Family Justice Paradigm”, Keynote Address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 delivered at Family Conference 2024 (3 September 2024) at paragraphs 27–28):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The centrality of parenting obligations was emphasised in <em>CVC v CVB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30092-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 28</a>. Citing s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter, the court observed that “parental responsibility [was] one of the most fundamental obligations of a married couple”. The corollary of this is that the court must naturally be the last resort for the resolution of parenting matters. As the Appellate Division of the High Court recently emphasised, “[i]nstead of litigating in the courts for the variation of orders, parents should endeavour to make adjustments by agreement to the care and access orders where necessary… While the court remains accessible to parties who require a resolution to disputes that they are unable to resolve despite their best efforts, we stress that this course of action should be the last resort”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parents must therefore intentionally endeavour to make parenting decisions for themselves instead of fighting it out in court. They must work on reducing conflict instead of expending energy and resources to disparage each other. A divorce does not mark the end of one’s parenting obligations. After all, <em>parents know their child best and are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child. The court is no substitute for a child’s parent, and the task of making decisions for a child should therefore be undertaken by the parents working together, rather than by the force of a court order.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Even as I prescribed detailed care and access orders to give the spouses clarity on their rights and obligations after the divorce, I emphasise that they are always welcome to agree to different care or access arrangements for the child, just as they had agreed to share the custody of the child. Any such amicable agreement would conduce to the best interests of the child more than any formal order of court.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Signed Consent Order dated 2/12/2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at p 25</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at p 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [17]–[18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>2WAOM at [28(g)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>2HAOM562–563</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>2HAOM565</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>2HAOM551–567</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>H’s Subs at [44]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>1HAOM717–720</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>1HAOM at [218]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>2HAOM565</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [38(d)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [38(e)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>4HAOM at [11]–[12]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Cross-applications – Approach to assessing whether family violence under the “continual harassment” limb in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 is likely to be committed","Evidence – Admissibility of evidence – Admission of further evidence during trial for personal protection order","Evidence – Proof of evidence – Both applicants for personal protection orders alleging that the other party has committed multiple acts of family violence – Whether a court must assess the credibility of each of these allegations before determining whether to issue personal protection orders","Evidence – Proof of evidence – Evidential value of police reports in proceedings for personal protection orders"],"date":"2024-10-25","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 864 of 2024 & SS No. 867 of 2024","title":"XEP v XEQ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 95","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32394-SSP.xml","counsel":["Wife and Husband in person."],"timestamp":"2024-11-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XEP v XEQ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEP <em>v</em> XEQ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Under s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”), “family violence” covers the following types of conduct:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member. To prove family violence under this limb, the following must be established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The respondent has continually harassed the applicant intending or knowing that it is likely to cause the latter to suffer “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Thus, repetitive conduct that causes worry, emotional distress or annoyance can amount to “continual harassment”: see e.g., <em>Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> (“<b><em>Yue Tock Lim</em></b>”) at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7        <em>Second</em>, the applicant must prove that a PPO/DEO “is necessary”. One way of assessing whether this requirement has been proved is to ask the following question – <em>Is family violence likely to occur in future against the person(s) sought to be protected?</em> If the answer is “no”, a PPO/DEO will not be appropriate even if family violence has been committed. An example where a PPO was denied for this reason is <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [13] to [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I now return to the Wife’s and Husband’s applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the end of a trial –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found that the Wife and Husband were likely to continually harass each other, and that it was necessary to issue a protection order. Accordingly, I allowed (i) the Husband’s application and (ii) the Wife’s application (to protect herself).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I found that the Wife had failed to satisfy the requirements for a PPO/DEO to protect the Daughter from the Husband. Accordingly, I declined to make any such order against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I will now explain my decision. For a start, I wish to state that during the trial, the parties had made many accusations of family violence against each other.

Both parties relied on this incident to support their respective application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The 1 May incident was recorded on video.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This video revealed that for about 20 mins, <em>each party</em> had knowingly harassed each other. In the video –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband and Wife could clearly be seen recording each other during their altercation – while concurrently and repeatedly accusing each other of provocation. This is a highly provocative conduct: <em>VWT v VWS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26733-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 111</a> at [36].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife could be observed raising her voice and repeatedly confronting the Husband – even when the latter walked away from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband could be seen entering and remaining in the Wife’s and Daughter’s shared bedroom – despite being repeatedly told that he was invading their privacy and that he was to leave the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband could be seen repeatedly telling the Wife that she was prohibited from entering his bedroom and using its ensuite toilet – despite the latter being upset by this prohibition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband could also be seen telling the Wife that she was a mere occupier in the Flat and that she had no right to stay there legally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The 1 May incident is not an isolated incident of harassment between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It is not disputed that there is <em>deep and long-standing animosity</em> between them. During their marriage, the parties have filed numerous police reports accusing each other of having committed family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Back in 2013, the Wife filed a police report accusing the Husband of hitting her head. In 2018, she accused him of hitting her clavicle. In 2019, the Wife applied for a PPO against the Husband. (This application was subsequently withdrawn.) The evidence showed that the Wife had no qualms in summoning the Police to intervene in her altercations with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between December 2023 to early October 2024 (11 months), the Husband filed 31 police reports against the Wife for abusive, threatening, and harassing conduct committed against him. The Police had classified the incidents in four of these reports under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I pause to make a few observations regarding the evidential value of police reports in PPO/DEO proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The filing of a police report and the offence classification of the report by the Police do not prove that the act alleged in the report has been committed. This is because a police report is a self-interested statement, and its contents have not been tested in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The filing of a police report <em>per se</em> does not constitute harassment of the person complained against in the report: <em>Yue Tock Lim</em> at [80] to [83]; <em>GFS</em> at [61]. A contrary view can have the undesirable effect of deterring a person from genuinely reporting a wrongdoing or seeking police assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     However, where <em>both</em> parties <em>repeatedly</em> file police reports against each other, then one cannot exclude the possibility that they could have done so to improperly cause the other party to be investigated (and thus be harassed) in a game of tit-for-tat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s request to admit further evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the trial, the parties wanted to refer to some of the allegations of family violence in [14] above. In fact, the Wife had requested to admit <em>further</em> evidence – in the form of three videos – to support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I disallowed the Wife’s request. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a starting point, the evidence in a PPO trial should be confined to those that support or rebut the allegations of family violence contained in an applicant’s complaint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there are good reasons to depart from the starting position, then notice to admit the further evidence must be given as soon as possible. It is important that the other party (i) is not taken by surprise and (ii) has sufficient opportunity to respond to the further evidence: <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> (“<b><em>Lai Kwok Kin</em></b>”) at [57] – [60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In this case, the Wife’s request to admit the further evidence was belated. It was made (i) more than three months after the matter was fixed for trial, (ii) during the second tranche of the hearing, and (iii) while the Husband was being cross-examined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There is no evidence that the Wife had given advance notice of her request to admit further evidence to the Husband. To admit the further evidence in such circumstances is highly prejudicial to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Furthermore, the Husband shared that he had refrained from admitting further video evidence <em>of his own</em> to rebut the Wife’s case (when she testified at the first tranche of hearing about six weeks earlier) and to support his case. This was because he did not want to prolong the trial. However, if the Wife was permitted to admit the three videos, then he should also be allowed to admit his video evidence. In my view, the admission of further evidence by both parties in such haphazard circumstances is not desirable. If discipline is not imposed in the admission of further evidence, then a PPO trial can descend into chaos and end up being protracted. This is not in anyone’s interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, my decision to disallow the admission of further evidence did not prejudice the Wife. This is because I had eventually acceded to her request for a PPO and DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether there is a need to assess each allegation of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I take this opportunity to address a related issue – i.e., in cases where parties in cross-applications for PPO allege that the other party has committed multiple acts of family violence, must a court assess the credibility of <em>each</em> allegation in determining whether the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement for PPO is proved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the answer is no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On a plain reading, all that s 65(1) needs to be proved (for the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement) is that “family violence has been committed <em>or is likely to be committed</em> against a family member”. [emphasis added] In other words, the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement can be met if an applicant can prove that family violence “is likely to be committed” – there is no need for him/her to prove that such violence has in fact been committed prior to the PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from s 65(1), there are also good reasons why, in principle, a court should not be obliged to make findings as to whether family violence has been committed for every allegation raised by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The purpose of a PPO is <em>not to punish</em> a party for past acts of such violence: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him</em> at [10]; <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“<b><em>GFS</em></b>”) at [31]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]; <em>UMI v UMK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [37] to [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Instead, a PPO is “<em>pre-emptive</em>” in purpose – i.e., it protects an applicant from <em>future</em> family violence. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is in danger of family violence, then a PPO should be issued even if such violence has not been committed on the applicant previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, in the case of cross-complaints involving parties in a highly acrimonious relationship, there is a real risk of the parties expecting the court to adjudicate on who was “right” or “wrong” regarding their past differences. A PPO trial is not a forum to settle personal scores. There is little utility in expending court resources to scrutinise each allegation of family violence when it is already clear from the evidence or from a party’s conduct in court that he/she is ready to engage in escalatory “tit-for-tat” for the most minor slight perceived from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum up – in view of [12] to [14] above, I am satisfied that the Husband and Wife are likely to cause continual harassment knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement – Protection orders are necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I now come to the 2<sup>nd</sup> requirement. In my view, a PPO/DEO is “necessary” in the present case. My reasons are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Once it is proved that family violence “is likely to be committed”, then it must logically follow that a PPO is necessary to protect an applicant from such violence. In other words, a PPO is <em>presumptively</em> necessary: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     To displace this presumption, a respondent will have the <em>burden</em> of adducing evidence to prove that a PPO is in fact not necessary to protect the applicant. If the respondent fails to discharge this evidential burden, then a PPO ought to be issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the present case, the parties have failed to displace the presumption that a PPO/DEO is necessary. In fact, the evidence shows otherwise:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       As stated earlier, there is a deep and long-standing animosity between the parties. They are still living together and the Wife is unemployed. This means that the risk of friction between them is very real.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Just one month after the Wife commenced divorce proceedings in April 2024, both parties promptly applied for PPO/DEO against each other. <em>After</em> these applications were filed, the Husband had made 10 police reports against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Each party have resorted to recording the other party’s conduct during their arguments. Such acts can escalate the tension between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Husband’s conduct in [12(e)] above suggests that he believed that he was entitled to evict the Wife – despite the Flat being their matrimonial home. A DEO is necessary to make it clear that the Husband is not to either (1) intrude into the privacy of the bedroom of his estranged Wife or (2) evict her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To summarise – I have found that the Wife and Husband are likely to continually harass each other, and that a PPO/DEO is necessary for their protection. Accordingly, I allowed (a) the Husband’s application and (b) the Wife’s application (to protect herself).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO application for the Daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Requirements not met</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to the Wife’s application for a PPO to protect the Daughter from the Husband. I have declined to make the order. This is because in general, the Wife’s accusations that the Husband had committed family violence against the Daughter (a) are sweeping in nature, (b) lack particulars (such as time and place of the alleged violence), (c) do not fit the definition of “family violence”, and (d) are not borne out by the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Let me give an example. During the trial, the Wife alleged that the Husband had “scolded” the Daughter during the 1 May incident. According to her, this scolding is recorded in the video. The Wife’s claim is contradicted by the video.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It showed that at all material times during the 1 May incident, the Husband did not scold or behave in a threatening manner to the Daughter. On the contrary, whenever he spoke to her, the Husband was gentle – at times calling her “princess”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s request for the Daughter to testify</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     During the trial, the Wife requested that the Daughter be allowed to testify that she had felt threatened by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I rejected this request. My reasons are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In the video relating to the 1 May incident, the Daughter did not appear to be fearful of the Husband. In fact, she was outspoken and can clearly be seen to be confronting him regarding his decisions that she disagreed with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had tendered two handwritten notes from the Daughter dated 13 and 14 June 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It is also evident from these notes that the Daughter was not fearful of the Husband. In fact, she had levelled several accusations against him, including of him lying and “defaming” the Wife and her. The Daughter even threatened to call the Police if the Husband were to allege that the Wife had instigated her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Based on the tone and contents of her notes, it is not clear to me that the Daughter can be an objective witness. She seems to be siding with the Wife and parroting language that had been used by the latter. (See e.g., the Wife’s statement dated 27 August 2024 where the Wife accused of the Husband of “defaming” her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>) It is not disputed that the Daughter occupied the same bedroom with the Wife at all material times. In the circumstances, I cannot discount the possibility that the Wife might have alienated the Daughter against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, and in any event, I am of the view that it would not be in the Daughter’s interests to testify. Because of the acrimonious situation at home, she was already seeing a school counsellor. The Daughter should not be placed in a situation where she needs to – as a witness – take sides between her parents at the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The above are the reasons for my decision in the Wife’s and Husband’s applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Before concluding, I wish to convey the following <em>directly to the parties</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     You should not see the PPO/DEO made against each of you as “punishment” for your past conduct or as a judgement of your character. You should also not view the making of these orders as a sign that you have either “won” or “lost”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You live in a combined house consisting of two HDB units. You have ample living space. Keep out of each other’s way. Stop turning the home into a battleground for your contest of wills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It is an offence to contravene the orders that I have made. In other words, moving forward, you are not to commit any act can comes within the definition of family violence in [6] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If you intentionally or knowingly contravene the order(s), then you can be arrested by the Police and be punished with a fine and/or imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The PPO/DEO is purely a shield for your protection. Do not turn it into a sword by using it to provoke family violence. If you do so, the law will not be sympathetic to your cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, your acrimony towards each other affects your daughter.

As parties are siblings, I refer to the complainant as the “Brother” and the respondent as the “Sister”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties came before me with cross applications. The Brother’s chief complaint was that the Sister repeatedly went into his bedroom to clean it. He felt that his privacy was intruded and it had caused him stress such that he was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) a few times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Sister, in her defence, explained that she merely wanted to clean the room as her siblings did not clean their rooms.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Sister’s application related to an incident when tensions erupted over the aforesaid issue and the Brother assaulted her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties appeared in person. They were guided through the trial process. Parties were afforded the opportunity to cross-examine each other and make closing submissions. The Sister was in particular afforded multiple opportunities to cross-examine the Brother as she had attempted to state her case in detail instead of putting questions to the Brother during her cross-examination of the Brother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I granted the Sister’s application for a PPO against the Brother as it was not disputed that the Brother had physically assaulted her. The Brother did not appeal against my decision. I also granted the Brother’s application for the reasons stated below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The applicable law is clearly set out in the decision of the High Court (Family Division) in <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> and I reproduce the relevant parts in the next few paragraphs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Court is empowered to make a protection order under s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Protection order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.</b>—(1)    The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are thus two threshold requirements that must be met before a court may grant a PPO:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the court must be satisfied that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Family violence is defined in s 64 of the Charter as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member</em>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The civil standard of proof that is applied in determining whether PPOs ought to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The sole issue is whether the Sister’s acts in repeatedly entering the Brother’s room to clean it amounted to “continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to [the Brother]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I accept that ordinarily, a sibling cleaning another sibling’s room would be harmless (and indeed a loving act) and most certainly not amount to harassment. However, each case turns on its own facts. What may be harmless under one set of circumstances might be highly distressing in other circumstances. It is important not to make quick judgments without analysing the facts holistically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A pertinent point to note is that, according to the Brother, the Sister would enter his room sometime between 10pm or 11pm until 4am.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This was corroborated by a witness, who is the parties’ sister (“the Witness”), who shared a bedroom<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> with the Brother:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yah, because she---she choose the wrong timing to clean the room.

The Brother indeed stated that he had been admitted to IMH due to stress (see [2] above). Thus, I accepted that the Sister’s conduct had caused him anguish. Indeed, I note that the tensions erupted one day such that the Brother assaulted the Sister. While this was unacceptable (and was the reason why I granted the PPO for the Sister), it provided further support for the finding that the Sister’s conduct had caused the Brother deep distress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The next question is whether the Sister intended to or at least knew that her conduct would cause the Brother anguish. The evidence showed clearly Sister was aware that the Brother did not want her in his room. The Sister confirmed that the Brother had told her the same “numerous” times, which also confirmed that there were many instances of her entering the Brother’s room despite his protests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Witness also confirmed that the Sister would not take “no” for an answer, and when she (<em>ie</em>, the Witness) tried to lock the bedroom door (as stated at [12], the Witness shared a room with the Brother), the Sister would attempt to enter their room through other means.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In light of the evidence of both the Brother and the Witness, I was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Sister knew that her conduct in entering the Brother’s bedroom against his will would cause him anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I did not accept the Sister’s case which was essentially that she had to clean the room for the sake of hygiene. For example, she said:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">No, if the person does housework themselves, clean up their own room themselves, it’s fine. But they don’t even do so at all after 40 years of age. Not even one finger, not---don’t even lift, they---the whole window frame can be black colour. Okay. Because it’s very windy and we---we are on a low floor, and low floor unit, bad thing about that is there’s a lot of pests. They---they can even let a lizards go into the cupboard and stay inside there and---and breed and let cockroach, um, lay eggs all these things. And then---and then the cupboard mood---turned mouldy with yellow dots itself. So, when things is spoil, who is the one who repair? I am the one who repair and pay for everything. Huh? They don’t even pay a cent, they don’t even they---bother. When light is spoil, I repair. Everything I do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     However, there was no evidence to show that the Brother’s room was in such a squalid state that it had to be cleaned frequently against his will. There was also no evidence of pests in the Brother’s room or the house. To be clear, the photographs tendered by the Sister only showed at most a messy house;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> certainly not a house in such a state that she had to clean the Brother’s room in the wee hours of the night against his will. In any event, both parties are adults and it was not necessary for the Sister to impose her own hygiene standards on her Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To sum up, this was a case where the Sister entered the Brother’s room numerous times despite him making it clear many times that this intruded his privacy. The Sister would do so in the wee hours of the night, disrupting his rest. The Brother was so stressed that he was admitted to IMH (see [2] above). All these while, the Sister was aware that the Brother did not like her in his room. I was therefore satisfied that the Sister’s conduct amounted to continual harassment knowing that it was likely to cause anguish to the Brother. I was hence satisfied that the Sister had committed family violence against the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn to the question of whether it was necessary to grant the orders sought. It was clear from the evidence that the Sister had no insight into the impact of her conduct on her Brother. When queried whether she was willing to stop going into the Brother’s room given his discomfort, she replied:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">No, because---because he---because this unit belongs to my dad, not him. If he’s not comfortable, he can stay out. You ask him to stay out or get his own place. Because literally, he don’t upkeep his room and he’ll breed all the pest. Uh, because 2nd floor got a lot of pest. Whatever pest you name it, we got it. My mum’s ha---my mum’s room even got a cluster cockroach staying, yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As a result of the lack of insight and her clear insistence that she would continue entering the Brother’s room despite knowing the Brother’s distress, I found it necessary to grant both a PPO and a partial DEO (covering the Brother’s bedroom) for the Brother’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the above reasons, I allowed the Brother’s application for both a PPO and a partial DEO.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Brother’s Complaint Form;

The Defendant alleged that I had demonstrated bias by refusing his request to adjourn the contested divorce hearing of 9 September 2024 despite his medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The recusal summons was fixed before me together with an adjourned session of the contested divorce proceedings on 30 September 2024. The Plaintiff Wife had earlier indicated on 26 September 2024 that she would not be filing an affidavit in response to the recusal application. While the Defendant requested at the hearing on 30 September 2024 to be granted leave to file an additional affidavit, I did not think this to be necessary. The basis for his application was sufficiently laid out in his supporting affidavit, and there was no need for a rebuttal as the Plaintiff had chosen not to respond substantively. I therefore proceeded to hear the recusal application and dismissed it, with brief grounds provided later that day. The Defendant has appealed against the recusal application, and my full grounds are provided as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Defendant’s Case for Recusal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is trite that to succeed in a recusal application, the applicant must either show actual bias on the part of the judge, or apparent bias, i.e. that a fair-minded observer with reasonable knowledge of the facts would conclude that the judge was so biased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There is no evidence raised in the defendant’s affidavit in support of any actual bias on my part with regard to the Defendant. I therefore take it that the applicant’s case is based solely on apparent bias. The thrust of his complaint is that I had ordered him to attend the contested divorce hearing over Zoom on 9 September 2024 despite the existence of a medical certificate from his cardiologist, one Dr Lim Choon Pin, which recommended that he be exempted from attendance at court. The Defendant also complains that I had proceeded with the hearing until the arrival of paramedics (whom the Defendant had pre-arranged to fetch himself to hospital) heralded the end of the session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Threshold for Apparent Bias</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The law on recusal for apparent bias is set out in the case of <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0085.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85</a>, and was elucidated by Aidan Xu @ Aedit Abdullah J in <em>TOW v TOV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19792-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 16</a> at [31]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The test is whether the circumstances complained of would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the judge is biased. The assessment is made on an objective basis, but with the actual knowledge of the relevant facts. The fact that the yardstick is the perception of a fair-minded and reasonable person excludes any particular sensitivity or brittleness as to how the judge’s actions or statements should be judged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The threshold is not passed simply because a judge has made adverse findings or ruled against the interest of the applicant. The learned Judge further observed in <em>TOW v TOV</em>, at [34] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A judge in our adversarial system would be expected to sift through the evidence, choose one side’s version of the facts to the other’s, and normally, in the absence of objective evidence, reach conclusions on credit and credibility. If the judge considers that witnesses have been mistaken, deficient, or untruthful, the judge should make the necessary findings. The judge is not expected to be gingerly or tactful to the point of obscuring necessary findings. The courtroom is certainly not an arena for trial by combat, or for the flagellation of witnesses, but there is no safe zone against adverse findings in the courtroom: the court is concerned with the proof of a case, and will need to evaluate the credit and credibility of the witnesses who testify.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At [42], the court went on to observe that the mere fact that a judge had previously made adverse comments or findings against a litigant is not, on its own, sufficient for a recusal application to succeed. It should also be noted that even if the judge were wrong in his reasons or conclusion, that should not itself be reason to allege prejudice on his or her part (per <em>Werner Samuel Vuillemin v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21684-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHC 92</a> at [67]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Apparent Bias was Established on the Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The litmus test in the present appeal is whether the decision would lead an objective and omniscient onlooker to conclude that the judge was biased in the conduct of the matter. If so, this court should recuse itself of its own accord.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       To address the perception of my refusal to adjourn the contested divorce hearing, one needs to have regard to the long-drawn chronology of this matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjournments granted prior to the contested divorce hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Plaintiff’s writ of divorce was filed more than two years ago, on 4 August 2022. After the Defendant entered appearance on 20 October 2022, mediation and counselling was conducted from December 2022 to January 2023, but did not prove successful. Directions were then given for the case to proceed to a contested divorce hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Defendant next filed FC/SUM 734/2023 on 7 March 2023 to strike out the Plaintiff’s reference to a mutual agreement in the divorce proceedings. The summons was heard on 12 June 2023 and dismissed in part. The Defendant appealed against this decision in FC/RA 11/2023, which was heard by the District Judge in chambers and dismissed on 1 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant then filed a further appeal against the dismissal of his striking out application on 4 August 2023, in FC/RAS 14/2023. The appeal hearing was initially fixed for hearing before the High Court Family Division on 20 September 2023, but this was eventually adjourned six times over a period of about ten months to 18 July 2024 on account of the Defendant’s heart condition. The full details of these adjournments are provided to give a flavour of the latitude granted to the Defendant for his medical condition for the interlocutory appeal.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"15.3430686137227%\"><col width=\"16.3432686537307%\"><col width=\"16.9833966793359%\"><col width=\"21.1842368473695%\"><col width=\"30.1460292058412%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Case / Type of Hearing</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date of Hearing</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Correspondence</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Whether Medical Certificate (“MC”) tendered</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reason for adjournment</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">RAS 14/2023 (Hearing)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">20 September 2023</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">17 September 2023</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">MC dated 17 September 2023 exempting Defendant from court hearing from 16 to 20 September 2023.

This was nearly a year after it had been filed on 4 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjournments granted in the course of the contested divorce hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The matter first came before me for hearing of the contested divorce on 13 August 2024. It would eventually be adjourned six times over the course of the next ten weeks to accommodate the Defendant’s medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The First Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the first hearing date of 13 August 2024, the Defendant was absent from court. It transpired that he had sent an e-mail to the Registry fifteen minutes prior to the hearing, informing that he had just undergone an angioplasty procedure that day. The e-mail attached Dr Lim Choon Pin’s memo, which requested the court to adjourn his case for three months until after 30 November 2024. No explanation was given why advance notice was not provided for the Defendant’s absence, given that the hearing date had been fixed since 17 July 2024. The memo also did not comply with the Family Justice Court’s Practice Directions (“the Practice Directions”), as it did not state specifically <em>whether and when</em> the Defendant was unfit to attend court. The court accordingly directed that the matter be adjourned to 27 August 2024, and that the Defendant resubmit a medical certificate which excused his attendance for that day as well as any further date, accompanied by a full medical report explaining his medical history in relation to his heart problems. The Defendant was also instructed to ensure that his medical certificate be in compliance with paragraph 162(3) of the Practice Directions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Second Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Defendant next wrote in with a medical report from Dr Lim Choon Pin dated 17 August 2024. The doctor observed that the Defendant had had some bruising and swelling at the right groin access site for his recent angioplasty procedure, and was still being monitored to see if his chest pain symptoms had resolved. The doctor recommended that the Defendant was medically unfit to attend court for the period from 13 August 2024 to 30 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, the court converted the hearing from an open court hearing to a hearing over Zoom, and adjourned the hearing (for a second time) from 27 August 2024 to 9 September 2024. The registry’s reply via email on 26 August 2024 emphasised to the Defendant that the change of mode of hearing was in deference to his medical condition, noting as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Should you feel concerned about your medical condition, you may locate yourself either in a hospital or in a place where you can be readily assisted should any medical emergency arise. You may wish to consult with your medical doctor on how best to make arrangements for such attendance. As family proceedings are confidential, you are reminded to ensure that you attend the Zoom hearing in a private room, although you are at liberty to call on assistance in the event of any medical need or emergency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In a further response on 5 September 2024 to the Defendant’s repeated requests to further adjourn the divorce hearing, the Defendant was also offered the option of attending the Zoom proceedings from a room in court, so that ready assistance could be provided in the event of any medical emergency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Third Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The adjourned hearing was next held on 9 September 2024, with the Defendant choosing to attend the proceedings over Zoom from his residence. He repeated his request for an adjournment, which was denied on the basis that he could call for medical assistance if needed. Over the course of the hearing, the Defendant revealed that he had made a prior arrangement for an ambulance to pick him up from his residence at 10.30 am on the day of the hearing. He admitted that this had been arranged some four to five days prior to the 9 September hearing (i.e. on 4 or 5 September). He also revealed that the ambulance service had contacted him on the night of 8 September and that he had confirmed the appointment. When the paramedics eventually arrived at 11 am during the morning hearing, the court had little choice but to adjourn the hearing (for the third time) to 18 September 2024, 2:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Fourth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Defendant next wrote in on 10 September 2024 with a medical certificate indicating that he was unfit to attend court from 9 to 22 September 2024. As a result, the hearing was adjourned (for the fourth time) to 26 September 2024, at 2:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Fifth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the morning of 26 September 2024, the Defendant wrote in at 10:23 am claiming that he had suffered a heart attack in the morning and was currently warded in Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. The hearing was adjourned (for the fifth time) to 30 September 2024, with fresh directions given to tender a medical report and medical certificate in compliance with Practice Directions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Defendant next submitted a clinical discharge summary, a medical report and medical certificate on 27 September 2024. The clinical discharge revealed that he was admitted and warded at the Mount Elizabeth Novena hospital from 26 to 27 September 2024 for chest pain, right groin pseudoaneurysm and right subconjunctival haemorrhage. No mention was made of him having suffered a heart attack as had been claimed. He was discharged with a medical certificate granting hospitalisation leave and which stated he was not fit for court attendance, for a period of 18 days from 26 September to 13 October 2024. As directed by the court, Dr Lim Choon Pin submitted a medical report dated 27 September 2026 which re-iterated his earlier recommendation that the Defendant was medically unfit to attend court until 30 November 2024 (when his prescription of double blood thinners ends). It is not clear if there was actually a consult conducted by Dr Lim with the Defendant in the course of the latter’s recent admission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Sixth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The hearing next proceeded on 30 September 2024, with the Defendant attending under protest. The recusal summons was mentioned first, with the Defendant seeking leave to file a further affidavit in support of his application. This was declined as the Plaintiff had earlier indicated on the hearing of 26 September 2024 that she was not filing an affidavit. An opportunity was given for the Defendant to orally submit on the recusal application, which he declined to do on the basis that his doctor had advised him that he could not be involved in any argument or hearing. I noted that the Defendant had clearly stated his position in his supporting affidavit, and being satisfied that he had sufficiently put forward his case, proceeded to hear and dismiss the recusal summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The court did not proceed thereafter with the contested divorce hearing. Instead, special directions were given on account of the Defendant’s medical condition. Each party was directed to file a list of questions via correspondence by 7 October 2024, with leave to file a final reply affidavit solely restricted to answering the questions posed by 18 October 2024. It was also directed that if no questions were tendered, the court would take it that the party had no questions to be raised in cross-examination. Mindful that the Defendant’s latest medical certificate (dated 27 September 2024) recommended absence from court until 13 October 2024, the hearing of the matter was adjourned to 22 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether a reasonable person would have a reasonable suspicion of bias</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As can be seen from the above, the Defendant was given ample latitude since September 2023 due to his medical issues, with six adjournments given over the course of his interlocutory appeal, and another six adjournments over the course of the present contested divorce hearings (two of which were <em>prior</em> to the 9 September 2024 hearing which is the subject matter of the recusal). It is noteworthy that despite being given respite since September 2023 to July 2024 from court proceedings, the Defendant had chosen to put off his angioplasty procedure throughout this period, even though his own doctor had recommended that he undergo this procedure. This was evident from Dr Lim Choon Pin’s medical report dated 8 April 2024, which provided the following assessment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I first saw [Defendant] on 13 October 2023 in my outpatient cardiac clinic. He reported symptoms of chest tightness and had undergone a CT coronary angiogram at Starmed under Dr Peter Ting that had showed significant blockage in one of his heart arteries (left anterior descending artery). He came to see me for further management of his cardiac condition. He subsequently underwent a coronary angiogram on 17 October 2023 which showed that he indeed has significant coronary artery stenosis in the mid to distal left anterior descending artery and fractional flow reserve was impaired (0.73) with adenosine challenge. <b>He was recommended to undergo angioplasty and stenting of this artery, but chose medical therapy instead.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Currently, [Defendant] has decided to postpone his decision for angioplasty and stenting of his narrowed heart artery.</b> He wants to pursue medical therapy, but still complains of chest tightness when he gets angry, hence my recommendation that he be excused from court proceedings until end of May 2024 when I review him again for the effectiveness of his treatment. If his chest pain is better controlled, he can resume attending court. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Defendant then curiously fixed the angioplasty procedure on the first date of the hearing of the contested divorce hearing on 13 August 2024, with only 15 minutes’ prior notice given to the court. It also bears mention that he had arranged in advance for an ambulance some four to five days before the next proceeded hearing date of 9 September 2024, even before he faced any actual emergency on that day. The recording of the proceedings conducted over Zoom will also show that despite the Defendant’s repeated insistence that he was unable to conduct the proceedings, he appeared calm and was able to advance his case, at least until the pre-arranged arrival of paramedics compelled an adjournment of the session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Despite the multiple delays occasioned by the Defendant’s medical condition in the interlocutory appeal, this court had adjourned the present hearing six times over a period of ten weeks from 13 August to 22 October 2024. It had also given the Defendant the leeway to attend the hearing on Zoom from a hospital, clinic or any location where he could be assured of medical assistance if needed. These special arrangements were granted because there was a clear and pressing need to move the proceedings forward in this case, given that more than two years had passed since the filing of the divorce writ. It is apposite to remember that justice delayed is also justice denied. This is underscored by the judge-led approach under Rule 22(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014, which exhorts the court to “make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economic disposal of the cause or matter.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It should also be remembered that the pith of the recusal application is not the correctness of the directions given by the court. It is whether, from an objective viewpoint, such directions reveal bias or prejudice on the part of the court such that it should remove itself from further conduct of the proceedings. Given the extensive delay occasioned in this case, I did not find the directions made to be unreasonable in the mind of an objective bystander. Quite to the contrary, every latitude had been extended to the Defendant to manage his medical conditions and to proceed with reasonable despatch with the present proceedings. It should be remembered that the court is not bound to abdicate its management of court proceedings at the behest of medical practitioners, no matter how well intentioned. The court remains the master of its own procedure, and is solely responsible for balancing the needs of justice with the demands of efficiency. In the present case, every reasonable accommodation has been made in view of the Defendant’s medical issues, including multiple adjournments and a shift in the modality of hearing, first to a remote hearing, and finally to an exchange of questions and answers by way of affidavit. There is no indication that the Defendant is unable to pen thoughts to paper to further his case, and these special directions have been given to move proceedings along in a manner that minimises any risk posed to the Defendant’s health. It bears noting too that considerable prejudice has already been suffered by the Plaintiff, who has waited two years for the divorce proceedings to move forward. Under the circumstances, I do not think that the directions given in the conduct of this case would give rise to an impression in the mind of an objective bystander that the court had been biased against the Defendant in the conduct of these proceedings. Quite to the contrary, a court which adjourns <em>ad infinitum</em> on medical grounds may be perceived as being unjust to the other party stranded in adjudicative limbo through no fault of their own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I accordingly dismissed the application for recusal, as well as the attendant prayer that the divorce proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of the recusal summons, since this was no longer necessary.

They were married in June 2002 and have four children. After 21½ years of marriage, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in March 2023. The divorce was uncontested and interim judgement was granted in November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The matter came before me for a decision on ancillary matters. My decision on these matters is summarised as follows (for the details of my orders, see <b><u>Annex B</u></b>):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Both parties shall have <b>joint custody</b> of their four children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall have <b>sole care and control of the children</b> – with reasonable access being granted to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The <b>matrimonial assets</b> shall be divided in the proportion of <b>30% (to the Husband)</b> and <b>70% (to the Wife)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To implement this division –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband shall be entitled to <b>$192,696.80</b> in the Wife’s CPF accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband shall transfer his rights, title and interests in the matrimonial home to the Wife upon the transfer of the monies above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Aside from the matrimonial home, each party shall retain their assets in their sole names. There shall be no further claims against Parties and/or their assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband shall pay to the Wife <b>$700/month for each child’s maintenance</b>. (Total child maintenance for four children: $2,800.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children – Custody, care and control, and access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the ancillary matters relating to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The four children are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>1<sup>st</sup> Child</b> – Female, 15 years (D.O.B. xx January 2009).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Child</b> – Female, 13 years (D.O.B. xx November 2010).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>3<sup>rd</sup> Child</b> – Male, 7 years (D.O.B. xx March 2017).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>4<sup>th</sup> Child</b> – Male, 7 years (D.O.B. xx March 2017).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In this judgement, the children will be referred to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The 1<sup>st</sup> Child and 2<sup>nd</sup> Child – collectively as the “<b>Daughters</b>”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The 3<sup>rd</sup> Child and 4<sup>th</sup> Child – collectively as the “<b>Twins</b>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Interim child orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At this juncture, it is important to note that on 4 March 2023, the Husband had removed the Daughters from the matrimonial home and made them stay with him at his parents’ flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As a result of the Husband’s actions, the Wife took out an application to seek, among others, the Daughters’ return to the matrimonial home. Following mediation, a consent order was entered in February 2024. It provided, among others, that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties were to have interim joint custody of all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was to have interim care and control of the Daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife was to have interim care and control of the Twins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Each party was to have access to the children not under their interim care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the hearing before me, it was agreed that the parties should continue to have joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Each party however wished to have sole care and control of all the children. It was agreed that the children should not be split between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Given the parties’ position, each of them would have to prove that he/she was a <em>more suitable parent</em> to take care of all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     To discharge such a burden, a parent should generally avoid a character assassination of the other parent. This is because such conduct creates needless acrimony without necessarily proving that one parent is a better caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Instead, a parent should show why <em>he/she</em> can better act in the child’s best interests. (This mirrors the approach for assessing the extent of a party’s indirect contributions to the marriage – i.e., to focus on the strengths of one’s case rather than to highlight the weaknesses of the other party’s case: <em>ARY v ARX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> (“<b><em>ARY</em></b>”) at [59].) In line with this approach, the parent should focus on proving why <em>he/she</em> can better <em>–</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Attend to the child’s emotional, developmental, and material needs,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Provide for the child’s daily care, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Make day-to-day decisions for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>See, e.g., <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> (“<b><em>TSF</em></b>”) at [67] – [69]; <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [72].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Relevant considerations</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14      <b><em>Considerations relating to the applicant-parent</em></b>. In line with [13] above, it will be helpful for a parent to specifically address the following when seeking to be a child’s sole caregiver:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Past and present interactions with the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Demonstrate, with concrete examples that are supported by contemporaneous evidence (and not just generic statements), how the parent has been showing concern, interest and responsibility for the child. See <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (“<b><em>ABW</em></b>”) at [23(b)]; <em>Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1987] SLR(R) 0725.xml')\">[1987] SLR(R) 725</a> (“<b><em>Tan Siew Kee</em></b>”) at [16] (where a father, who had taken the initiative to seek his son’s custody after removing him from the mother, was found to be more concerned for the child’s interests than the mother who took no step to resume custody of the child).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Identify which parent has been the child’s primary caregiver, especially when the child was young: <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29392-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 5 SLR 301</a> at [18]. If a parent claims to be the primary caregiver, he/she should produce concrete examples of, among others, (i) his/her involvement in significant events in the child’s life and (ii) occasions when he/she had made sacrifices to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The extent of the parent’s bond with the child: <em>UFZ v UFY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a> at [22]; <em>AAV v AAW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0488.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 488</a> (“<b><em>AAV</em></b>”) at [24] and [26]. Where <em>both</em> parents hold full-time jobs, then the fact that the child is closer to one of them can be a relevant consideration. The element of the maternal bond can be significant –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the child is very young: <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a> at [43] – [45] (the child was four years old); <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> (“<b><em>Wong Phila Mae</em></b>”) at [22(c)] and [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where all the other considerations are finely balanced: <em>Re W (A Minor) (Custody)</em> (1983) 4 FLR 492, cited with approval in <em>Chan Kah Cheong Kenneth v Teoh Kheng Yau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 2 SLR(R) 0595.xml')\">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 595</a> at [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The child’s wishes. This is relevant if the child is of an age to express an independent opinion: s 125(2)(b) of the Charter; <em>WKM v WKN</em> [2024] 1 SLR 15 (“<b><em>WKN</em></b>”) at [60] and [61]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(b)]; <em>ABW</em> at [23(d)]; <em>ZO v ZP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0647.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 647</a> at [15] and [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Future caregiving arrangements</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Demonstrate, with concrete examples, why the parent can provide better care if he/she is given sole care and control of the child. Examples of this can include the parent’s plans for the child’s care arrangements. It bears highlighting that a parent’s ability to provide for the child <em>financially</em> is a relevant – but not conclusive – consideration: <em>Re C (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0502.xml')\">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 502</a> (“<b><em>Re C</em></b>”) at [18]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [23]. The parent’s ability to care for the child is especially significant, for instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the child has special needs: <em>TSF</em> at [68] (where a father, who had in place an effective system to address the needs of his autistic child, was found to be a better caregiver).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where the parent has a physical and cognitive condition. In such a case, the parent should clarify whether the condition will impede his/her ability to care for the child, and if so, how this can be mitigated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Where the parent is working full-time and will need to enlist others to help care for the child. Where <em>both</em> parents are working, it is preferrable that a parent arranges for caregivers who are familiar to the child rather than relies on strangers to be the caregivers: <em>TSF</em> at [67] and [69]; <em>Re C</em> at [16] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parent’s ability to provide a secure and stable home environment for the child: <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(d)]. The parent’s occupation can sometimes be relevant to this consideration. See <em>Re C</em> at [4] and [19], where a mother, whose occupation involved fortune-telling, performing religious rituals, and frequent travelling, was found to be a less suitable caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Whether the parent can ensure a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent: <em>WKM</em> at [82], [83] and [85]; <em>ABW</em> at [45]; <em>TSF</em> at [82].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <b><em>Considerations relating to the other parent</em></b>. After the parent has demonstrated why he/she is suitable to be the sole caregiver, the parent can then, if necessary, show why the other parent may be an unsuitable caregiver. Some of the relevant considerations have been highlighted in [14] above. Others include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Evidence that the other parent has an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook on matters which can affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child. Cases where a parent has been found to be a less suitable caregiver on this basis include the following: <em>Tan Siew Kee</em> at [13] to [15] (a mother who was a habitual mahjong gambler and had no time to look after her child); <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [25] (a father who caused his children to lose out a year’s education because of his unconventional and informal education method); <em>AZB v AYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a> at [40] to [44] (a father who had a proclivity for pornography and had left pornographic materials in areas accessible to his child, had used foul language in the child’s presence, and had spoilt the child by lavishing her with gifts); <em>AAV</em> at [24] to [26] and [29] to [31] (a father who had a materialistic outlook and had ongoing relationships with two women).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Evidence that the other parent had intentionally or knowingly acted against the child’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <b><em>General considerations</em></b>. Finally, depending on the facts, the following considerations can also relevant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being: <em>ABW</em> at [20] and [21]. Thus, an order that will result in the child having to be uprooted and to reside in a different environment will not be lightly made: <em>Re C</em> at [17(a)]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [26] and [27]; <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> (“<b><em>VZJ</em></b>”) at [9] and [10]; <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27401-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 598</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Siblings should generally not be separated: <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(e)]; <em>ABW</em> at [23(e)]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> at [24].

The potential adverse impact that this can have on them is just too difficult to predict and manage. It is unnecessary to take such a risk.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) As for the Twins, they are only about 7 years old.

id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For completeness, I did not accept the Wife’s submission to deduct from the pool of matrimonial assets her legal fees ($30,000) in connection with the ancillary matters hearing. I agreed with the Husband that such a deduction is unprincipled and is akin to ordering costs against him. As the High Court had observed in <em>AQT v AQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0138.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 138</a> at [37]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It was highly unusual for the legal fees for these very matrimonial proceedings to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. It would be an unwise precedent to allow parties to deduct their hefty legal costs from the pool of matrimonial assets. Whatever liability parties owe their solicitors for the matrimonial proceedings should be settled from their own share of the matrimonial assets after division. To deduct the legal fees from the joint pool of matrimonial assets during the proceedings would be to render any cost order the Court made in the judgment largely nugatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">“Just and equitable” way to divide the assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Based on [24] to [26] above, the total value of the matrimonial assets for division is <b>$1,795,054.03</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The next question is what is a “just and equitable” way to divide these assets: s 112(1) of the Charter?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In answering this question, I noted that the parties (a) had a long marriage lasting 21½ years and (b) had both been working at all material times. In the circumstances, the “structured approach” to the division of matrimonial assets in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> at [22] and [26] (“<b><em>ANJ</em></b>”) would be applicable. Under this approach, a court considers two types of contributions when dividing the assets, giving them equal weightage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Direct contributions.</em> This is the “amount of financial contributions each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets”. In the case of the matrimonial home, this will include downpayments, deposits, cash payments and monthly payments towards the acquisition of the home, as well as renovation costs that are substantial and add a lasting value to the property: <em>Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1276.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1276</a> (“<b><em>Sim Kim Heng</em></b>”) at [82].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Indirect contributions</em>. This is “each party’s indirect contributions to the well-being of the family”. The following considerations apply to this type of contributions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Indirect contributions can be monetary, e.g., moneys that a spouse spends on (1) re-painting, repair of electrical wiring, and fittings (such as furniture) for the home, (2) maintaining the home, and (3) household expenses and payment of a child’s school fees: <em>Sim Kim Heng</em> at [82]; <em>ANJ</em> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Indirect contributions can also be non-monetary, e.g., where a spouse (1) attends to the care of the child (<em>VZJ</em> at [57] to [59]), (2) devotes time to look after an aged or dependent in-law (<em>Sim Kim Heng</em> at [82]), (3) makes personal sacrifices to advance the other spouse’s career and endeavours (<em>ARY</em> at [61]; <em>TIT v TIU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> at [36] and [37]; <em>UAP v UAQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21471-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 319</a> (“<b><em>UAP</em></b>”) at [80]); (4) supports the other spouse in times of the latter’s personal crisis (<em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [43]; <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [21]), and (5) carries out maintenance, repairs and improvements to the household appliances: <em>ANJ</em> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       A spouse’s indirect contributions <em>can be reduced</em> if there is undisputed evidence that he/she has acted in an extreme (i.e. manifestly serious) manner that harms the well-being of the family. It bears highlighting that the reduction is not intended to punish a spouse. The threshold to reduce a spouse’s indirect contributions is a “<em>high one</em>”. All factors must be considered in a holistic manner, and a reduction will not be made where both sides are engaged in a mutually destructive exercise: <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17048-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 195</a> (“<b><em>Chan Tin Sun</em></b>”) at [25], [27] and [28]; <em>UAP</em> at [82]; <em>TQU v TQT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24198-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 8</a> at [131]. Courts have reduced a spouse’s indirect contributions where, e.g., he/she (1) had sought to poison the other spouse (<em>Chan Tin Sun</em> at [25], [27] and [55]), or (2) had engaged in marital affairs (<em>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17978-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 52</a>).</p> <p

This decision was upheld on appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Court of Appeal however noted that the wife had a <em>known</em> pre-existing medical condition of a slipped disc. The court decided to award nominal maintenance – to preserve the wife’s future right to obtain financial support from the husband should she become unable to work on account of that medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em><u>AVM v AWH </u></em> <u><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17941-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1274</a> at [96] to [98]</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In this case, the husband was unemployed and an undischarged bankrupt. The wife, on the other hand, was economically independent. Given the circumstances, the court decided not to order spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_g\"></a>(g)     However, the court granted the wife liberty to apply for maintenance if the circumstances changed. In my view, although the court did not award nominal maintenance, the effect of its decision (i.e., the grant of liberty to apply) is similar in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Applying the principles in [52] and [53] above, I found that it was inappropriate to award nominal maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Reason A</em>. There is no evidence that the Wife was at risk of losing her job. In any event, an award of nominal maintenance based on Reason 1 is akin to making the Husband insure against the risk of the Wife losing her job. This is not the purpose of such maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Reason B.</em> I had already decided to award the matrimonial home to the Wife. As such, Reason B is moot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Reason C</em>. Awarding nominal maintenance based on Reason C is unprincipled and unprecedented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In my view, the Wife would be able to take care of herself financially after the divorce. She had been gainfully employed throughout her marriage and had been earning a relatively good income. Prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings, the Wife’s income was comparable to the Husband’s. At the time of the ancillary matters hearing, her income was higher than the Husband’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance – For the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’

The following part of this judgement is addressed to them directly as parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Many events have taken place since 4 March 2023. During the past 18 months, family members – who used to be close – have grown apart. From the CER, it appears that even before 4 March 2023, there were already cracks in your relationship between you and your children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Moving forward, you should seriously reflect on the effect of your actions on your children’s wellbeing. It is obvious to me that each of you love your children dearly. It is however less clear to me, and perhaps even to you yourself, whether you have expressed that love and acted in your children’s interests in the best way possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the current state of the family as well as the orders that I have made, you cannot adopt a “business as usual” mindset in your parenting approach. You must look within themselves – and seek professional help if possible – to see how you can salvage your relationship with your children. Now is the time for course correction. For instance, <em>be less controlling</em> of your children – and <em>be more conscious and sensitive</em> of their feelings and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_d\"></a>(d)     While you may be anxious to focus your attention on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Child, please do not forget that you have three other children. Each of them needs your personal care and attention. As all parents and educators know – <em>each child is special</em>, and each parent-child relationship is dynamic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In the coming weeks and months, you will make new discoveries about your children – especially with those who have not been under your care for the past 18 months. Be <em>less comparing</em> between the children – and <em>more cherishing</em> of their individuality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_f\"></a>(f)     One thing is clear. The next lap of your children’s life will be tough. <em>They will need all the emotional support that you can provide. They will also need both of you to work together to act in their best interests.</em> Now is your opportunity to make things right. Please be there for them.

Interim Judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was thus granted on 5 August 2021 where the orders relating to the ancillary matters (“AM Orders”) of divorce were made “<em>by consent</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Certificate of Final Judgment was granted on 9 November 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In June 2024, more than 2½ years later, the Defendant filed the present application, <em>ie.</em> FC/SUM 1758/2024 (“SUM 1758”) seeking to revoke or vary some of the AM Orders contained in the IJ. The Defendant claims that he was labouring under certain “mental disorders” at the time the IJ was granted and thus – according to his counsel – the IJ was obtained despite the Defendant’s “<em>mental incompetence and mental incapacity</em>”, or that the IJ should be set aside on the grounds of “<em>unconscionability</em>” because the Plaintiff had taken advantage of the Defendant’s situation at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For completeness, the Defendant seeks to set-aside Orders 3(c), 3(d)(a) – (f) of the IJ (“Disputed Orders”). In gist, these are the Orders relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets which the Defendant says do not reflect a “<em>just and equitable</em>” division of the parties’ assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant says these orders were not “<em>fair</em>” because they were made “<em>totally for the benefit of</em> [the Plaintiff]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To be clear, the Defendant does not seek to set aside the other orders in the IJ relating to: (i) custody, care and control, and access to their child, [K]; and (ii) the maintenance payable to the Plaintiff and [K].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Based on the parties’ written submissions and the counsel’s oral arguments, the issues before this Court are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Does the Family Court have the power to vary or revoke the IJ on account of a parties’ alleged mental “incompetence” or “incapacity, and/or on account of alleged “unconscionability” by one party?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Has the Defendant satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify revoking or varying the Disputed Orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I will discuss each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Basis For Revoking Or Varying Consent Orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I start by providing a brief overview of the applicable principles in relation to an application to revoke (or set-aside) orders dividing the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the WC (for ease of reference, I will refer to such orders as, “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) allows the Court to “<em>extend, vary, revoke or discharge</em>” at any time such division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     While s 112(4) appears, on first glance, to be broadly drafted, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> has made clear that this statutory provision does not give <em>carte blanche</em> to the Court to vary division orders given the need to ensure finality in ancillary matters proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal then proceeded to explain that the court may intervene to <em>vary</em> division orders where the order was unworkable, or has become unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This is the oft-cited “unworkability” test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The relevance of contractual vitiating factors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     What is less clear are the situations where the court may <em>revoke</em> division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In <em>AYM</em>, the Court of Appeal recognised that fraud may be a sufficient basis to vary or set-aside a division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal also referred to its earlier decision in <em>AOO v AON</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 1169.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</a> (“<em>AOO</em>”) where a division order made by consent may be set-aside if there has been a lack of full and frank disclosure.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal alluded to the fact that in the commercial sphere, the courts have recognised specific vitiating factors – <em>eg.</em> misrepresentation, mistake, duress, undue influence and unconscionability – which may operate to unravel a binding contract or agreement between the parties concerned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, the Court of Appeal made clear that because the issue before the court did not relate to these vitiating factors, the Court of Appeal declined opining on the precise application (if at all) of each of these vitiating factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Indeed, the Court of Appeal expressly noted that in its earlier decision of <em>AOO</em>, it also “<em>left open the issue as to whether or not a consent order could be set aside on grounds other than the absence of full and frank disclosure of the material facts…”</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the subsequent decision of <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a>, the High Court (Family Division), referring to <em>AYM</em>, held that the power to set aside or vary a consent order on the division of assets must be exercised narrowly and observed in passing that the applicant must provide one of the “<em>vitiating factors</em>”, or that the order was or has become unworkable. However, the High Court did not specify which “vitiating factors” it was referring to, although the parties’ allegations in <em>UMM</em> related to claims involving “<em>duress or misrepresentation</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Finally, it is also useful to have regard to the earlier decision of the High Court in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46305-M.xml')\">[2004] SGHC 275</a> (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”), where the High Court opined that s 112(4) of the WC “<em>should not be construed be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact more equitable in the objective opinion of the court</em>” and that what the court should be alert to is that “<em>one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As <em>Lee Min Jai</em> was decided well before the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>AYM</em> or <em>UMM</em>, it is not entirely clear whether the High Court was referring to the same vitiating factors noted in the latter decisions when it had referred to concept of one party having taken “<em>unfair advantage</em>” over another.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The upshot of the above discussion is that the issue of whether an otherwise binding consent order on the division of matrimonial assets could be set-aside (or varied) on the ground of undue influence and/or unconscionability has not been definitively addressed by the Court of Appeal or by the High Court. Although the High Court in <em>UMM</em> and <em>Lee Min Jai</em> alluded to the possible relevance of contractual vitiating factors and/or just and equitable grounds, the exact contours as to how these principles are to be applied were not discussed in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The doctrine of unconscionability </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the purpose of the present case, <em>both</em> parties’ counsel took the position that the doctrine of unconscionability may apply to set-aside division orders made by consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In particular, both counsel cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>BOM v BOK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22844-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 349</a> (“<em>BOM v BOK</em>”) as providing authoritative guidance of the doctrine in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given both parties’ position on the applicability of <em>BOM v BOK</em>, I will proceed on the basis (without deciding definitively) that unconscionability represents a vitiating factor which allows this court to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In this regard, the Court of Appeal – after undertaking a comprehensive review of the different conceptions of the doctrine of unconscionability in various Commonwealth jurisdictions – held as follows (at [142] – [143]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">142    In summary, and at risk of oversimplification, the <b>narrow doctrine of unconscionability applies in Singapore</b>. To invoke the doctrine<b>, the plaintiff has to show that he was suffering from an infirmity</b> that <b>the other party exploited in procuring the transaction</b>. Upon the satisfaction of this requirement, the <b>burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable</b>. In this regard, while the successful invocation of the doctrine does not require a transaction at an undervalue or the lack of independent advice to the plaintiff, these are factors that the court will invariably consider in assessing whether the transaction was improvident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">143    It is important, though, to reiterate that the application of <b>the criteria of infirmity must not be overly broad</b>, lest we be led back, in effect, to the broad doctrine of unconscionability. It is also important to note that although there might be overlaps between our approach and the broad doctrine of unconscionability – at least because the latter would, by its very nature, encompass situations falling within the former – the broad doctrine of unconscionability still goes further than our approach because it may potentially encompass fact situations where the “special disability” concerned (see Amadio, per Deane J at [132] above) is something broader than the type of infirmity we referred to in the preceding paragraph. That said, an overly broad application of the narrow approach we have endorsed might assist in stretching our narrow approach to cover a fact situation that is not intended to fall within it. We therefore find it imperative to caveat at this stage that our approach ought not to be utilised in such a manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Additionally, the Court of Appeal noted that whether there has been an infirmity on the part of party asserting unconscionability is an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry, and that not every infirmity would be sufficient to invoke the doctrine. The Court of Appeal also noted that “[s]<em>uch infirmity must also have been, or ought to have been, evident to the other party procuring the transaction</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will thus apply the aforesaid legal principles in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Setting-aside a contract due to mental incapacity </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Apart from alleged unconscionability, the Defendant also submits that the Disputed Orders should be set-aside or varied on account of his alleged “incapacity” and mental “incompetence” at the time they were made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As with the issue of unconscionability, neither counsel expressly addressed in their submissions the question of <em>what</em> is the exact legal nature of this assertion and the context under which it was made; counsel appeared to assume that “incapacity” or “incompetence”, if proven, are reasons to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While it might appear obvious, it remains relevant and important to properly situate the Defendant’s arguments. As I would allude to below, the gist of the Defendant’s case is that he was suffering from Adjustment Disorder (with Depressed Mood) and Alcohol Use Disorder (collectively, referred to as the “Disorders”). He therefore argues that he “<em>did not fully understand and comprehend or know the ramifications of what</em> [he] <em>was signing</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In effect, the Defendant is saying that the draft IJ he had signed (which resulted in Disputed Orders being part of the AM Orders) was voidable due to his mental incapacity at that time under the common law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     To be clear, I did not consider the relevance or application of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 as neither party raise the same for the Court’s consideration. I have also proceeded on the assumption that mental incapacity is a contractual vitiating factor which applies to matrimonial division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In <em>North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Megatrucare Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25970-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 110</a>, the General Division of the High Court (“High Court”) noted that the legal test of determining whether a contract is voidable due to a party’s incapacity (as set out in the earlier decision of <em>Che Som bte Yip v Maha Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1989] 2 SLR(R) 0060.xml')\">[1989] 2 SLR(R) 60</a>, a case cited in the Defendant’s Bundle of Authorities) required the party asserting a lack of capacity to prove that the other contracting party <em>knew or ought to have known that he was mentally disordered and had no contractual capacity</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the Defendant’s allegations also involved alcohol use, the High Court’s observations in <em>Resort World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Lee Fook Kheun</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22620-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1039</a> (“<em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>”) are also apposite. In <em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>, a case involving a claim by a casino patron to invalidate a credit facility agreement he had entered into with the casino, the High Court held (at [21]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">21    Intoxication results in impairment of mental capacity, and for that reason has been likened in the law to mental incapacity: see <em>Molton v Camroux</em> (1849) 4 Exch 17,19; 154 ER 1107,1108. A person seeking rescission must show that, first, when he entered into the transaction he was so drunk that he was unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction. This level of understanding was explained by Hallett J in <em>Manches v Trimborn</em> (1946) 115 LJKB 305, 307 as “such a degree of incapacity as would interfere with the capacity of the defendant to understand substantially the nature and effect of the transaction into which she was entering.” Second, the counterparty to the transaction must have known of his infirmity. In <em>York Glass Co Ltd v Jubb</em> (1925) 42 TLR 1 (CA) 2, the claim failed as the counterparty “did not know and had no reasons to know that [the complainant] was out of his mind at the time.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In summary, the principles which may be gleaned from the case law is where a party asserts that he lacked mental capacity (whether by reason of an alleged medical condition, or intoxication) when he had entered into an agreement, that party must show:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that he had no mental capacity at the time he entered into the contract, and that he was unable to understand its general nature and effect; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the <em>other party</em> knew about this infirmity and that he lacked contractual capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is only when <em>both</em> requirements are satisfied that the court would find that the contract is voidable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It follows from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above that the central issue before this Court is whether the Defendant was suffering from mental incapacity (<em>ie.</em> that he lacked contractual capacity when he signed the draft IJ on 7 June 2021), or some form of infirmity (in the context of the Defendant’s case under the doctrine of unconscionability), which the Plaintiff had known, and/or taken advantage, of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The key question was thus whether the alleged Disorders operated on his mind on 7 June 2021 such that it gives rise to an alleged incapacity or infirmity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant has failed to show that he was labouring under any incapacity or infirmity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Defendant has wholly failed to establish his claim that he was so infirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In support of his case, the main piece of evidence relied upon by the Defendant is the medical report which he had obtained from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) in November 2023 (“IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report”), almost 2½ years <em>after</em> he had executed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In gist, the IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report was prepared in response to a request for a medical report on the Defendant and in it, the hospital set out the Defendant medical history and the doctors’ diagnosis (<em>ie.</em> the Disorders) following his admission into IMH on 31 August 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In a follow-up report prepared by IMH dated 22 December 2023 (“IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report”), IMH provided further clarifications on the nature of the Disorders and the possible causes of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, I agree with the Plaintiff that nowhere in the IMH’s 1<sup>st</sup> Report or 2<sup>nd</sup> Report was a definitive statement that the Defendant was <em>in fact</em> suffering from the Disorders in or around June 2021. Indeed, as the Plaintiff’s counsel pointed out in their submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely opined that the <em>symptoms</em> of the Defendant’s Adjustment Disorder “appeared to have started about two to three months prior” to 31 August 2021. This was a largely tentative statement based on <em>inter alia</em> the Defendant’s <em>self-reporting</em> of increased alcohol consumption in the preceding months.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Importantly, the IMH doctor who prepared the IMH Reports expressly stated that he was “<em>not able to comment on the Defendant’s mental capacity retrospectively as</em> [the doctor] <em>had not assessed him when he signed the Consent Order of Court for his divorce matters</em>”. This was a crucial point as that meant there was no objective evidence whatsoever as to whether the Defendant was in fact suffering from the Disorders in June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     What was more critical was the complete absence of any medical opinion or evidence that the alleged Disorders did affect (or was even capable of affecting) the Defendant’s contractual capacity, or his understanding of the Draft IJ. The IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely explained that a person with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood develops “<em>emotional symptoms of depressed mood like feeling low and hopeless in response to identifiable stressor or stressors</em>” and in respect of Alcohol use Disorder, that the individual would spend a great deal of time obtaining or using alcohol and exhibit symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and tolerance. None of the IMH Reports specifically mentions any mental impairment on the individual’s ability to understand or enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It is plainly insufficient for the Defendant to merely point to his physical or mental ailments at a particular point in time, without establishing a link between those ailments and his ability to enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Dorothy Tan (“Ms Tan”), who submitted that the present case is analogous to <em>UMV v UMW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21967-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 60</a> (“<em>UMW</em>”). In <em>UMW</em>, a husband sought to set-aside a draft consent order which he had signed because <em>inter alia</em> he had been taken advantaged of as he was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Mood Disorder at the relevant time when the consent order was signed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In rejecting the husband’s application, the learned District Judge in <em>UMW</em> noted that despite all the medical reports adduced by the husband, none of them “<em>went so far as to say either that the</em> [husband’s] <em>condition had impaired his ability to make decisions at the material time or that his free will had been overborne when he consented to the</em> [consent order]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I agree with the Family Court in <em>UMW</em> that there must be a causal link or connection between a party’s mental state/condition <em>and</em> his ability to understand the draft consent order when he executed it. Otherwise, any party would be allowed to renege on his/her legal obligations years later by pointing to the existence of some mental condition at the time the contract or agreement was signed even though the said condition had no effect on that party’s ability to enter into a binding contract.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant was not exploited or taken advantage of</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The lack of objective documentary evidence in support of the Defendant’s claim of mental incapacity or infirmity must also be weighed against the surrounding circumstances leading up to, and following, his execution of the Draft IJ on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As Ms Tan had pointed out in her submissions – the Plaintiff, through her solicitors, sent draft copies of the relevant divorce papers (which included the Draft IJ) in late April 2021. This was 4 months before the Defendant was admitted into the IMH, and more than 1 month before the Defendant signed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Moreover, the circulation of the divorce papers in 2021 must not be considered in isolation. The Plaintiff also provided evidence that both parties had previously discussed the possibility of a divorce and the division of their matrimonial assets the year before, in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In text messages exchanged between the parties on or around 21 February 2020, the parties discussed the terms of a potential divorce including the transfer of their matrimonial flat to the Plaintiff with “<em>no refund to</em> [the Defendant’s] <em>cpf</em>”. The Defendant then asked the Plaintiff what this proposal meant, and after the effect of such a term was made known to the Defendant, he responded “<em>ok</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was therefore not surprising that in the divorce papers circulated by the Plaintiff’s solicitors in April 2021, clauses were included for the transfer of the matrimonial home without refunds made to the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund (or “CPF”) account, in line with the proposal made the year before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In any case, the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ email dated 30 April 2021 fairly and unambiguously stated that the Defendant was “<em>strongly encouraged</em>” to “<em>seek independent legal advice</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Defendant was also asked to identify any parts of the proposed divorce terms he did not agree with, and to provide his counterproposal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It was within this context that the Defendant responded to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, via email on 5 May 2021, indicating that he had already “<em>signed</em>” a copy of the papers and that the solicitors should verify the same with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s solicitors then replied to the Defendant informing him that arrangements need to be made for him to sign the documents in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths (“CFO”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This was followed by a series of email correspondence between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s solicitors arranging to execute the divorce documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Thus, contrary to what the Defendant’s counsel had sought to argue,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I find that there was nothing in the exchange of correspondence between the parties which suggests any pressure being placed on the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In fact, the Defendant was clear in his email responses that he had wanted to sign the documents to complete the “<em>proceeding</em>”. The correspondence also did not show the Defendant expressing any hesitation or uncertainty <em>vis-à-vis</em> the terms of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties eventually decided on 7 June 2021 as being the date the Defendant would attend before the CFO to sign the relevant divorce papers. The CFO in question was one Ms [N].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Given the seriousness of the allegations relating to the Defendant’s capacity to sign the Draft IJ, the Defendant was directed by the Court (at a Case Conference conducted for the present application) to invite Ms N to provide her response/account as to what had transpired on 7 June 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Ms N stated, in her email reply to the Defendant’s solicitors on 1 August 2024, that she could not recall specifically the event in question given that it occurred in 2021 (some 3 years ago).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> However, Ms N was clear in that it was her practice when asked to witness the execution of divorce documents (for simplified divorce track cases) that she would ask the defendant to go through the papers, especially the draft interim judgment. She will then ask if the defendant understood the contents and whether the defendant agrees with the contents. She will remind the defendant of the clause in the draft interim judgment as regards his right to independent advice. She will only request the defendant to sign the draft interim judgment if the defendant agrees. This process is then repeated for the rest of the divorce papers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In my view, there were no cogent reasons or basis provided by the Defendant to challenge Ms N’s evidence as to what she would normally do, or that she <em>did not</em> carry out the same steps in his case. In fairness to the Defendant’s counsel, he did not seek to challenge Ms N’s position at the hearing of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I thus accept Ms N’s explanation and find that she had undertaken the same process when the Defendant attended before her on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I should add that next to where the Defendant’s and Ms N’s signatures were placed in the Draft IJ, there was appended in clear type-written print the words, “<em>I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice</em>”. This puts in beyond peradventure that the Defendant was not only informed of his right to seek legal advice, he had also freely and independently provided his assent to the terms in the Draft IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, the Defendant’s conduct <em>post</em>-execution of the Draft IJ also reflected his understanding <em>and agreement</em> with the divorce terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In support of the Plaintiff’s case, she exhibited the text messages she had exchanged with the Defendant on 12 August 2021, one (1) week after the IJ was granted by the Family Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In these messages, the Defendant discussed the sale of the parties’ cars and even sought to explain to the Plaintiff how she could reduce the costs of purchasing a new car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     These discussions on the cars are relevant because part of the Disputed Orders required the Defendant to sell the cars and for the sale proceeds to be retained by the Plaintiff. This was also one of the Orders he is now asking this Court to set-aside. If the Defendant was of the view that this was an order which should not have been made, why then did he discuss with the Plaintiff how to implement it? More importantly, there was nothing in the messages disclosed which suggests that the Defendant was dissatisfied with the Disputed Orders, that he did not understand what the Orders meant, or that he was labouring under some form of incapacity or infirmity; he was clear and specific as to what he wanted to inform the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Accordingly, I find that the Defendant was <em>not</em> suffering from any mental incapacity or infirmity which vitiated (or affected) his consent when he executed the Draft IJ. He was not in a state (whether induced by alcohol or otherwise) which rendered him unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Further, and in any event, it is clear from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above (at [22] and [31]) that the mere presence of a mental infirmity on the Defendant’s part is insufficient to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability and/or mental incapacity to set-aside a legally binding contractual document. The Defendant must <em>also</em> show that the Plaintiff knew about the said infirmity and had taken advantage of, or exploited, the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In this regard, I find that the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) <em>did not</em> in any way take advantage of the Defendant in the execution of the Draft IJ. The evidence adduced showed that there were <em>no indicators</em> exhibited by the Defendant which would cause the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) to think or believe that the Defendant did not agree with the Draft IJ, or that he was labouring under any infirmity or incapacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In any event, any doubt which the Defendant could have exhibited by his behaviour or conduct (which I have found not to be present) would have been adequately addressed when the Defendant attended before the CFO and had executed the divorce documents in her presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As stated above, I find that the CFO, Ms N, had ascertained his understanding of the Draft IJ, including his right to seek independent advice and the Defendant had indicated his agreement to the terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to prove the existence of any mental incapacity on his part, or any unconscionability on the Plaintiff’s part, which justifies the Disputed Orders being set-aside or varied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     My finding that the Defendant has not proven that he was labouring under any mental incapacity or infirmity as at 7 June 2021 (or in the overall divorce process) sufficiently disposes of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     However, I will make a few more observations arising from the submissions and issues raised by counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     First, much of the Defendant’s written submissions sought to present his case as one involving some abstract conception of “unfairness”, or that the terms of the IJ was not “just and equitable”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     As Ms Tan had pointed out during her submissions, these abstract references do little to assist the Court in reaching a decision in the case. I would go further to say that a court applies the law, and the relevant legal principles; cases are not decided based solely because one party (or a court) later believes an outcome appears “unfair”. As Choo J in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> had aptly emphasised, s 112(4) of the WC should not be seen as an invitation to rewrite the terms of a settlement so that they appear “<em>more equitable</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> That is not the purpose of the statutory provision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Indeed, the Family Court’s processes and procedures have been designed to ensure that an unrepresented party would be given the relevant opportunity and information to take independent legal advice in cases under the simplified divorce track. For example, litigants are required to execute a draft consent order (or interim judgment) which contains an express clause to remind the litigant of his/her right to independent legal advice and that the terms of the draft order have been agreed to on that basis. To further reinforce this, the unrepresented litigant is required to sign the document before a solicitor or a CFO, who is not acting for the other party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the present case, all of the above procedural safeguards have been followed. Ms N, the CFO, confirmed that she had explained the relevant matters to the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s solicitors too acted appropriately and fairly by emphasising to the Defendant in their correspondence that he could seek independent advice and could even provide counterproposals if he wanted to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I am unable to see how the Defendant was treated unfairly or unjustly. If the Defendant chose to agree to the terms of the Draft IJ and had executed the relevant documents, despite numerous reminders given to him to seek independent legal advice, it does not lie in his mouth now that he had been ignorant to the terms of the Draft IJ because he had not instructed solicitors to act for him at that time. Put simply, a bad bargain is not an unfair bargain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Second, as alluded to above, both counsel appear to accept that the whole suite of vitiating factors (including concepts such as mental incapacity and the doctrine of unconscionability) applies with the same force and rigour to matrimonial consent orders as they do to contracts in the commercial sphere. This is despite the fact that the Court of Appeal has not, in fact, definitively determined the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As the applicability of these vitiating factors was not challenged by the parties, I had applied the same in my determination of the present case. However, my decision should not be taken as the court having accepted the position advanced by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In my view, one could argue that not all contractual vitiating factors recognised in the commercial sphere should apply unattenuated to matrimonial consent orders. As I had noted at [72] above, the execution of draft consent orders in matrimonial proceedings are subject to clear procedural safeguards. The legal force of the eventual order emanates from the court which does not act as a mere “rubber stamp”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This stand in contrast to commercial contracts where similar features may not be present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Further, concepts such as whether the impugned commercial transaction was at a “<em>considerable undervalue</em>” or whether it was “<em>fair, just and reasonable</em>” (arising from the application of the narrow doctrine of unconscionability) may not automatically sit well with other principles of matrimonial law. It is, for instance, not clear whether these concepts are analogous to the principle of “just and equitable” division of the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(10) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     If so, are parties then required to advance hypothetical scenarios/arguments before the variation court as to whether the marriage was a single or dual income, or what approach or methodology should be applied to divide the parties’ assets? These submissions may arguably be necessary if the court is required to assess whether what the parties had agreed under the impugned consent order was better (or worst) of than what the Family Court would hypothetically have ordered if the parties had chosen to undergo a contested hearing for the division of their assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In fact, such difficulties did arise in the present case (albeit in the form of a preliminary issue raised by the Plaintiff’s counsel). At the commencement of the hearing of SUM 1758, the Defendant’s counsel sought to provide the supposed values of the assets mentioned to in the Disputed Orders with the intention of showing how much the Defendant had unfairly “given up” as a result of what he believes to be an “unfair” order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Yet, Ms Tan rightly pointed out that the parties never had the benefit of any court-mandated disclosure or discovery process to ascertain the nature of their assets or the correct value of the same when the IJ was granted, precisely because they had already agreed to settle the divorce amicably. I note that there were also no allegations of material non-disclosure or fraud raised by the Defendant which suggest that he did not know what assets the parties owned (or the value thereof) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The Defendant’s attempt to ascribe values for assets which existed more than 2 years earlier was therefore entirely speculative. This was especially given that the Defendant’s values were unsupported by any objective evidence. There is also the question as to whether the party responding to such assertions (for <em>eg.</em>, the Plaintiff in the present case) would be prejudiced given that he or she would then be required to ascertain the value of assets which may have since been disposed of, or lost, due to the effluxion of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It follows from the above that a court may not be in a position to then use these speculative figures or arguments to ascertain the hypothetical question of whether the terms of the consent order were at an “undervalue”, or that the division order was not “fair, just and reasonable” when it was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     However, as these issues were neither fully argued by the parties nor put before me, I shall say no more on the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Finally, I had, in the analysis set out above, focused on whether the Defendant has provided sufficient basis to set-aside the Disputed Orders. As I have found that he has failed to prove the existence of any incapacity or infirmity, or that he had been taken advantage of, the Disputed Orders will not be set-aside. I will also not <em>vary</em> any of the Disputed Orders for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     To be clear, I did not consider the issue of whether the Disputed Orders (or the AM Orders generally) ought to be varied because of any alleged “unworkability” of specific terms in the AM Order. For example, the Defendant’s counsel alluded to the fact that the deadline for the sale of the parties’ matrimonial assets, as envisaged in the AM Order, has since expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In this regard, I agree with Ms Tan who submitted, in response to the Court’s clarification, that neither party made submissions on the issue of unworkability and, importantly, that the Defendant must be held to what he had specifically prayed for in SUM 1758, <em>ie.</em> for the Court to decide whether Disputed Orders ought to be set-aside or varied for the specific reasons of the Defendant’s incapacity or under the doctrine of unconscionability, and not some other reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     If there are any concerns as to the continued workability of the AM Orders (including whether there has been overpayment by the Defendant through the use of his CPF monies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>), those concerns should be properly ventilated at the appropriate forum when the appropriate application is before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In conclusion, I dismiss SUM 1758 in its entirety as the Defendant has not made out his claim that the Disputed Orders should be varied or set-aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     It leaves me to express my gratitude to counsel for their submissions and, in particular, to Ms Tan for her oral and written submissions which I had found to be clear and detailed, and from which the Court has derived much assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dd 15.07.24 (“PA1”) at [8] and [13] – [24].

I heard the application on 30 September 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       It was the Husband who filed for divorce on 9 February 2024. According to the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”), parties were married on 4 August 2019 in India. Both the Husband and the Wife are Indian citizens.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has been resident in Singapore since 2019 when he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor at one of the local universities (“X”). The Wife remained in India to complete her doctoral degree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The COVID-19 pandemic meant that both the Husband and Wife were kept apart, though they remained in touch via virtual means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties were reunited after travel restrictions had been lifted. They had a good relationship during this time. They went on many trips together. The SOP states that the Husband brought the Wife on numerous trips to Europe in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was not to last. Cracks in the relationship began to form when the Wife began to verbally attack the Husband. They quarrelled over money. The Wife accused the Husband of ruining her career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the state of their relationship, parties agreed to separate, and the Wife agreed to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This did not happen. The Wife returned to Singapore. The SOP states that she began a scorched earth campaign – this included sending complaint letters to the Dean of the local university where the Husband was employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This led to the Husband filing for divorce. The Wife filed her Defence thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> At this time, she was unrepresented. On the 10<sup>th</sup> of May 2024, she appointed counsel: Mr K Jayakumar Naidu (“Mr Jayakumar”) of Jay Law Corporation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Mr Jayakumar subsequently took out SUM 2274 to amend the Wife’s Defence. The purpose of this application was to tidy up the Defence. Mr Jayakumar had formatted the Wife’s Defence and tidied it up as best he could. In doing so, he separated the paragraphs which formed the Wife’s Defence, and the paragraphs which formed her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Pang Khin Wee (“Mr Pang”) of IRB Law explained that the Husband only had a single objection to the proposed amendment which was the inclusion of an allegation that the Husband had used research grant money to pay for the trips to Europe (see above at [5]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Mr Pang urged me to consider Rule 422(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”), which states that the court may at any stage of the proceedings allow any party to amend their pleading, in light of the applicable principles for striking out pleadings which are instantiated in Rule 405 of the FJR 2014. According to Mr Pang, Rule 405 demonstrates that pleadings should not contain scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters. Given that the proposed amendment contains scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters, it should not be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     There is much force to the proposition that the court will not allow amendments to pleadings if the proposed amendments contain matters that are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (to use the language of Rule 405 of the FJR 2014). After all, amendments are generally allowed for “the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [422.02] citing <em>The “Virginia Rhea</em>” [1983 – 1984] SLR(R) 639 at [5] citing with approval <em>GL Baker Ltd v Medway Building &amp; Supplies Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/5141-E-M.xml')\">[1958] 1 WLR 1216</a> at 1231.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     What I have said above, however, would likely only be in issue where the proposed amendment seeks to introduce new facts into the pleadings. In the present case, however, the line which the Husband took offence with was already contained in the original Defence which the Wife had filed. This was what the Wife had stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“My husband, plaintiff took me different places in Europe, using research Grant’s money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This was the proposed amendment:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had brought the Defendant to the various countries mentioned in the SOP with the money the Plaintiff was given as a research grant by [X], the school he was employed by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There is, in substance, no real difference between the proposed amendment, and what was contained in the original Defence. The only changes are, as Mr Jayakumar explained, purely cosmetic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Therefore, even if I am minded to accept Mr Pang’s argument (which, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not) – that the proposed amendment should be rejected, the allegation that the Husband had used money from the research grant to bring the Wife on trips would still remain, warts and all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the circumstances, I will therefore allow the Wife’s application to amend her Defence. The amendments correct a defect in the Wife’s Defence, namely that she had not separated matters that formed part of her Defence, and matters that formed part of her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I shall hear parties on costs. It remains for me to thank both Mr Pang and Mr Jayakumar for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife’s Defence was filed on 28 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supplementary Affidavit dated 14 August 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order – s 65, Women’s Charter – Wrongful Restraint"],"date":"2024-10-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Summons No 762 of 2024","title":"XBN v XBM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 69","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32272-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Complainant in person","The Respondent in person"],"timestamp":"2024-10-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Suzanne Chin","html":"<root><head><title>XBN v XBM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBN <em>v</em> XBM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32272-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 69</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Summons No 762 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Suzanne Chin </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Complainant in person; The Respondent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBN — XBM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">s 65, Women’s Charter</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wrongful Restraint</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Suzanne Chin:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The matter came for hearing before me in respect of cross applications for personal protection orders (”PPOs”). The ex-wife (“Wife”) had applied for a PPO to restrain the ex-husband (“Husband”) from committing family violence against her while the Husband filed an application for a PPO to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After hearing from parties on their applications for PPOs against each other, I granted PPOs in both applications i.e. a PPO in favour of the Husband in SS 640/2022 to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him as well as a PPO in favour of the Wife in SS 762/2024 to restrain the Husband from committing family violence against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has filed an appeal against my decision in SS 762/2024, the Wife’s application for a PPO against him and I set forth below the reasons for my decision. I would also mention that with regard to the Husband’s application for a PPO against the Wife in SS640/2022, during the trial, the Wife had admitted to committing family violence against the Husband on the relevant day and after considering the facts and circumstances, I granted a PPO in favour of the Husband against the Wife as I considered that it was necessary for his protection in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties married on the 4 April 2012 and divorce was granted on the 5 January 2021. The parties have 2 daughters who, at the time of the conclusion of the Ancillary Matters were 11 and 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 11 April 2022, Ancillary Orders were made by the court granting sole care and control of the 2 children to the Wife, with access to the Husband. It was as a result of the older daughter (the “Child”) not returning to the Wife’s residence after one of the access sessions that the series of events that eventually led to the cross PPO applications occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a PPO may be issued if the court finds on a balance of probabilities that (a) family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member; and (b) it is necessary for the protection of that family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 64 defines “family violence” to mean the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The section proceeds to carve out the exception of self-defence by qualifying as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While in the usual case, the first limb of s 65(1) is fulfilled by family violence having been determined to have been committed, it is important to note that a PPO may also be made pre-emptively, where family violence is “likely to be committed” and even if family violence has not in fact been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It should also be noted that the onus rests on the party bringing the application to show on a balance of probabilities that family violence had been committed and that it is necessary for their protection that a PPO be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incidents of alleged violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Both PPO applications were based on a single incident which took place on the 7 January 2024 and I set forth below the account of each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On the 7 January 2024 at around 10pm, the Wife arrived at the Husband’s home with 2 police officers as the elder daughter of the marriage (“the Child”) had not returned from access. According to the Husband, the Wife insisted that the court orders should be complied with and since she had been granted sole care and control of the Child, she wanted the Child to return to her home after the access session. The Husband recounted that the Child refused to return home with the Wife. All of this transpired while the Husband and the daughter were inside his house and the Wife and the 2 policemen were standing outside with a metal gate separating them. The Husband eventually opened the gate on the bidding of the policemen and also the daughter who wanted the gate to be opened. The parties and the Child appear to have continued their discussions and eventually the policemen left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband recounted that shortly thereafter, the Wife started pulling the daughter out of the house by holding onto the child’s body. The Husband explained that at that juncture, he grabbed the Wife’s forearm to prevent the Wife from forcing the Child to leave with her and the Wife reacted by kicking, punching and scratching him. In the meantime, the Child had been released from the grip of the Wife and stood outside the gate. The Wife then told the Child to run to the lift. The Husband recounted that that he held onto the Wife’s right hand and tried to push her out of the house with the intention of trying to stop the Wife from hitting him and also from leaving with the daughter. He maintained that he had used “some strength” but after the Wife started hitting and punching him, he reacted by holding harder onto her hand to stop her. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     By that stage, according to the Husband, the child had run to the lift and at the same time, his mother who was at home at the time surfaced and witnessed the commotion. The child then signalled to her grandmother to call the police, The Wife then told the child to run and the child then went into the lift and left the scene by taking the lift to the ground level. Thereafter the Husband still holding onto the Wife took the lift down with the Wife. He contended that the Wife had been continuously hitting him. As they arrived at the ground floor and stepped out of the lift, they found that police officers had arrived at the scene, and it was at that point in time that he let go of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband maintained that he had not committed Family Violence against the Wife as he had acted in self-defence and had grabbed her purely for the purpose of preventing her from leaving with the daughter against the child’s will and from preventing her from hitting and punching him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Wife recounted that on 7 January 2024 at around 10pm as the daughter had not come home from access with her father, she had gone to the police station and requested that the police accompany her to the Husband’s residence to help her seek the return of the Child. When she arrived at the Husband’s residence with the police, she spoke to the Child who told her that she would go back with her only if the Wife did not pursue the maintenance enforcement application she had made against the Husband. As they continued the conversation, according to the Wife, the Child then started to say that she wanted to go back with her. Shortly thereafter, the metal gate was opened and as the daughter had agreed to go home with her, the daughter put on her shoes and stepped through the entrance of the Husband’s residence into the corridor outside of the house. At that point in time, the Husband grabbed the Child’s hand and started to pull her. The Wife explained that to stop him from pulling the Child back in, she hugged onto the Child and pulled at her. At the same time, she stepped on the Husband’s feet and pressed down hard in the hope that he would let go of the Child’s hand. The Child managed to break free and the Wife then told her to quickly run to the lift to take the lift down. At that point in time, the Wife maintained that she tried to block the Husband and he then grabbed her upper arms forcefully to try to stop her. She then kicked him on the stomach area in a bid to get him to release her. The parties continued in their positions until the Husband’s father came out to try to stop them but the Husband flung off his father’s hand. When the lift door opened, both of them entered the lift and took the lift to the ground floor where they found the police with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife did not deny that she had caused the Husband “hurt” and admitted that she had inflicted family violence on him. She maintained that by the same token, the Husband had also caused her hurt by grabbing onto her upper arms and in this regard she provided photographs of bruises as well as a referral letter written by the medical clinic she had attended on the 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Witnesses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In addition to his account of the incident, the Husband had called his parents as witnesses to provide their version of the incident. The Husband had at the trial indicated to the court that he had intended to call the daughter as a witness in support of his case but just before the trial, the daughter had been warded into hospital as a result of a mental breakdown and remained in hospital for observation. In light of this he could not call his daughter to appear as a witness for the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In contrast, the Wife did not call any witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Family Violence had been committed by the Husband on the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Based on the Husband’s own account, he contended that he had not hit the Wife back but had merely held onto her to restrain her so that she could not force the child to go back home with her. He was also contending that he had restrained her also to stop her from hitting him and accordingly he had not committed any family violence on the Wife but had acted in self-defence. The Wife’s case was that the Husband had caused her hurt by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt and this was evidenced by the bruise she had suffered on upper arms. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, I also thought it relevant to consider if the Husband had inflicted family violence on the Wife by “wrongfully confining or restraining [her] against ..her will”. Accordingly, the questions to be considered are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Husband had caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Upon consideration of the accounts provided by each of the parties as well as the account provided by the Husband’s witnesses, I noted that the Child had clearly been conflicted on the day. I accepted that the Child had spoken to the Wife about dropping the maintenance enforcement claim she had filed against the Husband and appears to have indicated to the Wife that this was a precondition to her returning home. This was not challenged by the Husband but he also explained that the Child had only been willing to return home provided she was allowed to live with both of her parents. Regardless of the actual reason, it was clear that the Child was in two minds about returning to the Wife’s residence but was also not averse to this. The fact that the Child had in the circumstances and after the long discussions put on her shoes suggests that the discussions with both parents had reached the point where the Child was ready to return with the Wife. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that both parties agreed that it was the Wife who had asked the Child to run to take the lift down to the ground level which the Child appeared to have responded to. If indeed the Wife had physically removed the Child against her will from the Husband’s residence as the Husband recounts, it would have been unlikely that the Child would have responded to the Wife’s instructions to run.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband indicated that he had restrained the Wife by holding her by her forearm on that day with a view to pushing her out of the house as she had tried to take the child with her. I did not find that his account made sense and found that the Wife’s account of events appeared to be more consistent and logical. Based on the sequence of events, it would appear that the Child had already agreed to leave with the Wife and had put on her shoes when the scuffle began and it would have been more likely that the Husband had held onto the child’s hand in a bid to prevent her from leaving with the Wife. In response, the Wife had grabbed onto the child who was literally caught in between the 2 parents during the tussle and at the same time started stamping onto the Husband’s foot to get him to release the child. The Wife’s efforts must have paid off as it appears that shortly thereafter, the child was out of the grip of both parents and ran towards the lift. The parties then started focussing on each other with each trying to prevent the other from running to the child. It was not disputed that at this point, the Husband held onto the Wife to prevent her from leaving with the child and in response the Wife started hitting and kicking the Husband in an attempt to get him to release her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I considered the Husband’s contention that as the Wife had continued to hit and kick him, he had no alternative but to restrain her in self -defence. In the case of TEK v TEJ <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a>, the court referred to the Court of Appeal case of Tan Chor Jin v PP [2008] 4 SLR 206 where the concept of private defence was referred to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose….”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on his own account of events, it was the Husband’s position that he had grabbed onto the Wife’s forearms to restrain her from taking the Child with her. According to him, as the Wife grabbed the Child in an effort to pull the Child out of the house, he had grabbed the Wife’s hand to “prevent her from…physical contact…to stop her from pulling my daughter.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was clear that the initial act of restraint by the Husband was not an act of self-defence but was an act of restraint with an intention of restraining the Wife from leaving with the Child. Subsequently as the Wife tried to break free, she started kicking and punching the Husband:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“…. I used some strength… I tried to push her away without holding at first. Then subsequently…. the mother…. after pulling out my daughter, then reacted, ….by kicking and punching me repeatedly… Then I reacted.. by holding…..harder on her hand while to… to try to stop her from hitting me…”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>While the subsequent reaction of the Husband by grabbing onto the Wife even “harder” could be described as a reaction to her hitting and kicking him and can be argued to have been in self- defence, the initial act of restraining the Wife at the outset cannot be considered to be self-defence and in fact, it was apparent that the Wife’s act of “kicking and punching” the Husband was a reaction to the Husband’s restraint as she was trying to break free. I do not think this was a situation where the Husband had found himself “suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation”. The Husband’s act of restraining the Wife led to the Wife’s reaction of kicking and punching him and was clearly a situation created by the Husband himself. Accordingly, I was of the view that the Husband had not acted in self-defence on that occasion. It should also be noted that the restraint by the Husband continued even after the child had left the scene and was no where close to either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In view of this, I concluded that the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     With regard to the bruises suffered by the Wife, which were not challenged by the Husband, it was clear to me that they were as a result of the force used by the Husband in restraining the Wife and I was of the view that the Husband had also caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, based on the above, I determined that on the balance of probabilities, the Wife had proven that Family Violence had been inflicted on her by the Husband during the incident on 7 January 2024. I would add, that while I had reached the conclusion that family violence had in fact been committed by the Husband on the Wife based on the evidence before me, taking into account the continued and heightened acrimony between the parties, their behaviour towards each other during the trial and the fact that there would be ongoing child access arrangements which likely might lead to further disputes between the parties, I determined further that family violence “is likely to be committed” going forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether it is necessary for a PPO to be granted for the protection of the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As the incident in question arose out of the current access arrangements and bearing in mind that there will be continued access by the Husband to both daughters, the likelihood of another similar dispute and incident ensuing is high. In light of this, I determined that it was necessary for a PPO to be granted against the Husband for the protection of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Having considered all of the evidence and submissions before me, I granted the Wife’s application for a PPO against the Husband. It is worth noting that I had also granted the Husband’s application for a PPO for his protection. I had also made counselling guidance orders which required both parties to attend counselling in the hope that this will provide to both of them some insight into their current situation and help them understand the requisite boundaries which should not be crossed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this case, I would also add that the Child has been severely impacted on by the divorce and the continued acrimony between her parents. On the day of the incident, upon the parties’ arrival at the ground floor, they had found the daughter who had taken the lift down earlier, with the police. In his statement, the Husband provided the following account in his police report of the incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“… causing my daughter to break down and wanted to end her life by trying to snatch police gun. My daughter is subsequently suppressed with assistance from the 2 police officers.

She is therefore entitled to costs (see <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). Considering the circumstances of the case, namely that there was not a large number of items pursued in discovery, and that SUM 2194 did not involve any novel questions of law, I fix costs of SUM 2194 at $1500 (all-in). This sum shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife by 12 November 2024. I also order that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum from the Husband, make payment to the Director of Legal Aid as is required under s 16 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (see <em>XDF v XDG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32215-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 82</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As for costs of SUM 2193, which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, the Wife argues that although I had dismissed her application, there should be no order as to costs given that she was legally aided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Here, s 14 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 is relevant.

As Ms Vidthiya had explained during the hearing before me, the Wife had posed those interrogatories because she wanted to know “why the Husband had these debts”. She did not want a situation where the Husband “incur[red] debts and shirk[ed] his responsibility to provide for the children: <em>XCL v XCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a> at [18].

After hearing the parties, I ordered the Respondent to pay to the Complainant spousal maintenance of $2,840 per month but declined to grant any backdated maintenance. The Respondent has since appealed against my decision. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the time of the trial on 29 May 2024, the Complainant was 30 years old and the Respondent was 35 years old. The Complainant was unemployed, while the Respondent worked as an Assistant Professor at a local university (the “University”). The parties married in India on 4 August 2019. There are no children to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the marriage, the Respondent worked in Singapore while the Complainant continued living in India, studying for her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Chemical Biology. The Complainant moved to Singapore to live with the Respondent sometime in October 2022. Parties thereafter lived together in an apartment provided by the University that was located in an on-campus residential estate (the “University Apartment”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime on or around 20 December 2023, parties travelled to India together. The Complainant returned to Singapore on 31 December 2023, while the Respondent returned on 11 January 2024. After the Complainant returned, she did not return to the University Apartment, and the parties have been separated since. While the Respondent continued to reside in the University Apartment, the Complainant stayed with friends until sometime in February 2024. She also travelled back to India for a period in between.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Complainant filed this application on 19 February 2024, seeking maintenance for herself. Since then, and as at the time of the trial, the Complainant lived in a shelter at a location she said she was not at liberty to disclose. She said that she was allowed to stay there for a period of three months, which was almost over by the time I first heard the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The applicable legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Complainant’s application was made under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “Charter”). Under s 69(1) of the Charter, the court may make a maintenance order in favour of a married woman where her husband has proven to have neglected or refused to provide her with reasonable maintenance. In making its determination, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the applicable factors set out at s 69(4) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As there are currently divorce proceedings underway, the maintenance order sought in this application is inherently interim in nature. The objective of such interim maintenance is to tide the complainant over while the divorce proceedings are in progress (<em>AXM v AXO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0705.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 705</a> (“<em>AXM</em>”) at [16]). Where there are pending divorce proceedings, the court will adopt a broad-brush approach in assessing the immediate needs of the complainant, since the issue of what maintenance she should eventually be entitled to will be revisited at the final hearing of the ancillary matters (<em>WGD v WGC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28744-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 69</a> at [30]), where the court is better placed to investigate the full facts of the case (see <em>AXM</em> at [13(c)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Complainant’s primary position was that the Respondent should pay her a lump sum maintenance of $359,628. The Complainant said that this amount was calculated using her estimated monthly expenses of $5,500 per month as the multiplicand and the number of months of the marriage as the multiplier, less the cost of accommodation for the 14-month period she resided with the Respondent, and less the total amount of monies the Respondent had paid her during the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Complainant’s secondary ask was that the Respondent provides her with accommodation, plus a monthly sum of $2,000. If the Respondent does not provide her with accommodation, then she sought a monthly sum of $5,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant said that she required this maintenance until she finds a job that would pay her enough to sustain her lifestyle<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent’s position was that the sum of $400 per month, which he has been paying to the Complainant since February 2024, is sufficient for her maintenance. The Respondent was of the view that the Complainant should return to live in India, and reasoned that this sum of $400 would be sufficient to sustain her living expenses there<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the Complainant’s reasonable expenses be calculated based on her expenses in Singapore or in India?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant claimed that her personal expenses amounted to $5,642 per month. This was based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore, where she was residing as at the time of the trial. The Respondent argued that there was no reason why the Complainant should continue residing in Singapore, and that she should return to India. The Respondent believed that it would be easier for the Complainant to find a job in India and that she has only chosen to remain in Singapore to obtain a higher maintenance amount from the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. As such, the Respondent posited that any maintenance ordered should be based on the Complainant’s expenses in India, which would be significantly lower than her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was not disputed that the Complainant’s expenses in India would be much lower than her expenses in Singapore. After all, the Complainant had previously sustained herself and her widowed mother in India without any contribution from the Respondent and only with an income equivalent to $650 per month, which she received from her fellowship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. However, this fact alone is not reason why the Complainant must return to India to live.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, it is not unreasonable for the Complainant to remain in Singapore, at least pending the conclusion of the parties’ divorce proceedings. The Respondent argues that the Complainant has no family and no connection to Singapore, but this is not entirely accurate: her husband, the Respondent, continues to live and work in Singapore. While divorce proceedings are underway, the interim judgment had not yet been granted as at the time of trial. The Complainant had moved to Singapore in October 2022, ostensibly because the parties had decided that this was where they wanted to reside in together for the next phase of their married lives. There was no suggestion, nor was there any evidence, that this was a temporary move. It is a fact that this was where the parties had lived out the most recent years of their marriage, and the fact of the matter is that as at the time of the trial, the Complainant continued to live in Singapore with no evidence of any plans to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, I am of the view that the Complainant is entitled to defend the divorce proceedings brought by the Respondent in the manner that she deems fit. Just because she had lawyers acting for her in the divorce (as at the time of the trial) does not necessarily mean that this will be the case throughout the course of the proceedings. It is unclear what the scope of her counsel’s engagement was, or if she would have the financial resources to continue to fund this engagement if the divorce proceedings were to drag on. Further, apart from this application which the Complainant took out and litigated on her own, there are various court events that may require the Complainant’s physical attendance, even if she continues to be represented by counsel; a contested divorce trial is one such example, and any future maintenance enforcement proceedings is another. There may also be occasions where parties are required to attend mediation and counselling in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore find that the Complainant is entitled to remain in Singapore, subject to the relevant immigration requirements and regulations. This does not necessarily plant the Complainant’s feet in Singapore, nor does it cast the Respondent’s obligations in stone; in the event that the Complainant does return to India, the parties may seek a variation of any maintenance orders as necessary. However, I did not find it appropriate at this juncture to peg the Complainant’s expenses to the cost of living in India, which may unwittingly force her to return to India, thereby placing her at a possible disadvantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I consequently found it appropriate to assess the Complainant’s reasonable expenses based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Complainant’s expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     With the above in mind, I set out in the following table the monthly expenses that the Complainant claimed to incur<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, as well as my decision on them, taking into account the Respondent’s arguments with respect to the Complainant’s expenses:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"21.1357728454309%\"><col width=\"23.2953409318136%\"><col width=\"14.5170965806839%\"><col width=\"41.0517896420716%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Item</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Complainant’s position</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Decision</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>My reasons</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Rent</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2,900</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,800</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I elaborate on my reasons at paragraph 19 below. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Utilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">This was not substantiated but was not specifically contested by the Respondent.

To explain and elaborate further on my findings with respect to the Complainant’s rental expenses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Complainant was living in a shelter and was only allowed to stay there for 3 months. Even if an extension of her stay was permitted by the shelter, I did not find this to be a sustainable living arrangement for her, and certainly not one that was commensurate with the parties’ standard of living during the marriage. I therefore found it reasonable for her to seek suitable accommodation elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In support of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 for rental expenses, the Complainant provided a screenshot of some WhatsApp messages from one ‘Jeviar House’<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, which purported to be a conversation with a property agent that she had in March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. These messages indicated that the cost of renting a one bedroom and one bathroom fully-furnished HDB unit at 119 Bukit Merah View was $2,900. The Complainant said that she was open to living in cheaper accommodation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and considered renting a bedroom in a shared apartment. However, the unit that she found at a cost of $1,500 per month required her to share the apartment (which was a HDB flat in Jurong) with a male tenant, which she was not comfortable with. She therefore did not follow up on this<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I found the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month to be on the high side. I found it hard to believe that the Complainant was unable to find accommodation in Singapore that would cost her less than $2,900 per month, especially since she was open to renting a bedroom in a shared residence. The Complainant also did not provide any evidence showing her efforts made to find alternative accommodation, apart from the abovementioned WhatsApp messages. I further note that the Complainant never provided the listing for the unit at 119 Bukit Merah View, which would have shown the full details of this property. However, from the preview of this listing as can be seen in the messages provided, it appears that this was for the rental of an entire HDB 3-room flat, which would explain the higher monthly rental cost of $2,900.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the other hand, while the Respondent contested the reasonableness of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month, he did not provide any evidence showing the cost of alternative accommodation. The Respondent only asserted that this should be around $1,100, which was an amount he surmised based on his conversations with his interns at the University<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent also never questioned the Complainant’s evidence that renting a room in a shared apartment in Jurong would have cost her $1,500, nor did the Respondent make any submission to suggest that this was an unduly high amount for a room in a shared apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I therefore found that the sum of $1,800, which is slightly more than the sum of $1,500 that the Complainant said she was previously quoted for a shared apartment in Jurong, would be reasonable and sufficient for the Complainant to find a suitable accommodation for herself. In arriving at this conclusion, I also considered that the Complainant may have a more limited pool of options to choose from given the availability of female-only shared residences (which I did not find to be an unreasonable preference on her part) as well as the difficulties that the Complainant may face in actually securing an accommodation because of her uncertain immigration status.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The parties income and financial resources</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established that the Complainant’s reasonable expenses amount to $2,841 per month, I turn to assess the parties’ incomes and financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Before moving from India to Singapore, the Complainant received an allowance equivalent to about $650 per month from her fellowship. The Complainant has a PhD and, by her own account, was hopeful of obtaining a job in Singapore that would pay her about $5,000 to $6,000 per month. The Complainant said that she had been looking for post-graduate positions and applying for jobs. She had even attended interviews in August 2023 and in January 2024. By all accounts, the Complainant had the inclination to work and appears to possess the requisite qualifications to find a decent job. However, the reality of the situation is that the Complainant has never worked in Singapore and that she remained unemployed as at the date of the trial. Given the Complainant’s circumstances including the nebulous nature of her immigration situation, I found it hard to say if and when the Complainant would be able to gain employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Further, there was limited evidence before me on the financial resources available to the Complainant, save for some bank statements disclosed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, which revealed that her savings in Singapore and India total no more than the equivalent of $8,000 as at April 2024. There was nothing to suggest that the Complainant was in possession of undisclosed financial resources that would be able to tide her through the proceedings notwithstanding her state of unemployment, and the Respondent never made any assertions or submissions to this effect. I therefore accepted that the Wife was not in a position to pay for her reasonable monthly expenses in this interim period without contribution from the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In contrast to the Complainant’s financial situation, the Respondent earned a substantial income and had significant financial assets to his name. The Respondent’s own evidence was that he earned an average of $14,676 a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. His IRAS Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2024 showed that he received a total of $217,550 from his employment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, which translates to about $18,130 per month. Based on his declaration in his Electronic Template Statement (“ETS”), the value of his bank accounts and fixed deposits alone total over $360,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent, to his credit, candidly stated at trial that he could technically afford the monthly maintenance amount sought by the Complainant (of $5,000 per month)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. This cohered with my assessment of his financial means and his expenses. The Respondent’s personal expenses, as declared in his ETS, amount to $4,656.06 per month. I found that he was more than able to afford both the Complainant’s claimed maintenance amount and his own expenses, even if I were to take his stated expenses at face value without conducting a full analysis of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the circumstances as set out above, I ordered that <u>the Respondent shall pay to the Complainant a sum of $2,840 per month (rounded down) to the Complainant as her maintenance, payable on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month, starting from 21 June 2024</u>. It was evident from the disparity in quantum between the amount I had assessed as the Complainant’s reasonable expenses ($2,841) and the amount that the Respondent had been paying to the Complainant each month ($400) that the Respondent’s contributions have been insufficient. I found that this was not out of ignorance on the Respondent’s part, as the Respondent was patently aware of his obligations and had voluntarily transferred to the Complainant a sum of $400 per month, or for want of communication on the Complainant’s end, as the Complainant had sent an email to the Respondent on 4 January 2024, specifically requesting that he provided her with shelter and financial support<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Rather, this appears to have been premised on the Respondent’s view that the Complainant should return to India, which I found was not a fair and reasonable view to hold in the circumstances. I therefore found on the facts that the Respondent had indeed neglected to provide the Complainant with reasonable maintenance, and that a maintenance order in the Complainant’s favour was warranted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I declined to order the lump sum maintenance of $359,628 sought by the Complainant at this stage. The Complainant’s request stemmed from her belief that the Respondent should have provided but did not provide her with maintenance from the beginning of the marriage. However, prior to moving from Singapore to Osaka in October 2022, the Complainant was voluntarily living in India and earning an allowance. After moving to Singapore, she moved in to stay with the Respondent in the University Apartment, where they lived as a couple and even went on various overseas trips together, which the Complainant did not have to pay for. There was no evidence of her being in lack, nor was there any evidence of the Complainant seeking monies from the Respondent. I therefore did not find that the Complainant had proven her case in this regard, and in any case, I did not deem this to be an appropriate or justifiable mode of payment in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the same reason, I also declined the Complainant’s request for backdated maintenance for the period prior to January 2024. For the period thereafter, the Complainant stayed with friends, returned to India for some time, and lived in a shelter. She had sufficient funds to subsist during this period and did not incur any accommodation expenses during this period. During the Complainant’s stay in the shelter, most, if not all, of her daily needs were provided for.
