The Respondent is her Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After a trial, I dismissed the Wife’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The PPO application was filed on 1 June 2024. During the trial, the Wife confirmed that she had made the application on the basis that the Husband had <em>continually harassed</em> her by sending various WhatsApp messages between 11 May 2024 to 11 June 2024. (“<b>Relevant Messages</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5        <b><em>Sexually explicit messages</em></b>. A perusal of the Relevant Messages revealed that on about <em>two occasions</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> sometime on or after 11 May 2024, the Husband had sent messages to the Wife with the following contents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Explicit messages which reminded the Wife of how the Husband had used to make her feel sexually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Offensive messages which asked the Wife whether another man (whom the Husband believed to be the Wife’s lover) liked “our videos” and whether the two of them had engaged in sex.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Images of the Wife in undergarments and engaging in sexual acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Offensive messages which described the Wife as a “cum dump” and her pictures as “viral porno”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6        <b><em>Messages relating to child access</em></b>. The Relevant Messages also contained messages from the Husband requesting to be given access, as well as photos/videos, of the daughters. There were also numerous “missed voice calls” and “missed audio calls” from the Husband on about <em>five days</em> – i.e., on or around 10, 18 and 19 May, as well as 10 and 11 June 2024. Presumably, these missed calls were in connection with the issue of child access as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband admitted to sending the Relevant Messages. He however contended that a PPO was not necessary as he did not intend to cause either the Wife or his daughters any harm. The Husband believed that the Wife had applied for a PPO to use as leverage in their custody battle for the daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other Alleged Incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For completeness, I wish to add that on the day of the trial, the Wife had wanted to admit evidence regarding several alleged incidents of family violence (“<b>Other Alleged Incidents</b>”) – from 2021 to 29 September 2024 – that were not documented in either (a) her complaint for PPO (“<b>C1</b>”) or (b) her “Attachment A” statement filed on 24 July 2024 for the purpose of the hearing (“<b>C2</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Some of the Other Alleged Incidents were allegedly witnessed by 3<sup>rd</sup> parties and were also recorded on video.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband objected to the reference to Other Alleged Incidents at the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     After considering the matter, I upheld the Husband’s objection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In my view, the Wife can always make a separate PPO application regarding these incidents, if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, it will be highly prejudicial to the Husband if he had to respond to the Other Alleged Incidents without being given any sufficient opportunity to prepare his case against them: <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [57]-[60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Requirements for PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that <em>family violence has been committed </em><b><em>or </em></b><em>is likely to be committed against a family member</em> and that <em>it is necessary for the protection of the family member</em>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold and italics added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On a plain reading of s 65(1), the Wife must prove two things on a balance of probabilities to obtain a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife must prove that the Husband had committed or is likely to commit “family violence” against the daughters and herself. (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> requirement</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife must also prove that a PPO “is necessary” for the protection of the daughters and herself. (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1<sup>st</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, the Wife had satisfied the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement for PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband admitted that he had sent the Relevant Messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     By sending the Relevant Messages and making multiple calls to the Wife, the Husband had committed acts which fall within limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter. This limb defines “family violence” as “causing <em>continual</em> harassment with intent to cause or <em>knowing</em> that it is <em>likely to cause anguish</em> to a family member” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband had sent the Wife messages and images that were sexually explicit and humiliating. Given the contents of the Relevant Messages and the frequency in which he attempted to call her, the Husband must have known that they were “likely to cause anguish” to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The next question is whether the Wife had also proved the 2<sup>nd</sup> requirement for PPO. In my view, the Wife had failed to do so. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons and circumstances of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In deciding whether a PPO “is necessary for the protection of the family member”, logically speaking, the reasons and circumstances in which the family violence is committed is an important consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This is evident from the fact that Parliament had specifically legislated for two circumstances where a PPO would not be appropriate. The first is where a respondent commits family violence while lawfully exercising his right in self-defence. The second situation is where the violence is committed by way of correction towards a child: see definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from the circumstances prescribed in s 64, there can be other situations where a PPO may not be necessary. One example is where the family violence is triggered by a respondent’s momentary loss of self-control due to persistent and deliberate <em>provocation</em> by the applicant: see e.g., <em>VYR v VYS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26982-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 128</a> at [44] and [45]. In such a case, the <em>cause</em> for the family violence is the <em>applicant</em> – not the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons for the Relevant Messages </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There were two reasons why the Husband had sent the Relevant Messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Sexually explicit messages</u>. At the material time, the Husband was very angry with the Wife for apparently having committed adultery while he was in a drug rehabilitation centre (“<b>DRC</b>”). It is clear from the messages that despite his anger, the Husband was prepared to forgive the Wife and reconcile with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Messages relating to child access</u>. After his release from DRC (where he was detained for several months), the Husband missed his daughters dearly and wished very much to see them. The Husband had sent the messages because of his perception that the Wife was denying him reasonable access to his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">PPO is not necessary to protect the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having considered the Husband’s reasons for sending the Relevant Messages, I found that the <em>risk</em> of the Husband committing family violence against the Wife is <em>very low</em> and that a PPO is thus unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband explained during the trial that he had sent the sexually explicit messages in “a moment of distress” – i.e., the unexpected realisation, after being released from DRC, that the Wife had apparently committed adultery. In my view, the circumstances that triggered such messages are unlikely to recur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there is no evidence that the Husband had sent sexually explicit messages to harass the Wife either <em>before, or after</em>, the Relevant Messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Indeed, when considered in the wider context together with <em>other messages</em> between the parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> the Relevant Messages appear to an aberration in the Husband’s conduct. In all the other messages, the Husband had been very civil and reasonable towards the Wife. This was despite her having adopted an unfriendly tone in her messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, after the Relevant Messages, the Husband (i) had since accepted the fact that his marriage with the Wife had irretrievably broken down, (ii) is in the process of preparing for a divorce, and (iii) is now focussing his attention on securing reasonable access to his daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The issue now is whether the Husband would continue to harass the Wife over the child access issue. In my view, this is unlikely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       According to the Husband, he is placed on e-tagging until March 2025 and would be recalled to DRC if he were to get into trouble with the law. The Husband explained that he would not do anything to jeopardise his liberty and his custody battle for the daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I see no reason to disbelieve the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, I noted that since the sending of the Relevant Messages, the Husband had lawyered up. With the benefit of legal advice, the Husband is now aware of the boundaries of permissible conduct in securing access to his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">PPO is not necessary to protect the daughters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now turn to whether a PPO is necessary to protect the daughters. In my view, the answer is clearly no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As stated earlier, the Husband clearly loved his daughters. There is no evidence that he had committed prior acts of family violence against them. There is no reason why he would harm them in any way in future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite his strong desire to see his daughters, it is clear to me that the Husband would not do anything that is against their interests – including putting them in a stressful situation. One of the clearest examples of this is the Husband’s message to the daughters’ school on 14 May 2024. In that message, the Husband specifically told the school that he had no intention to “defy [the Wife’s] wishes of keeping the children away” from him”. He added that the school should “carry on with [her] wishes as [he] value the children’s mental well-being during these troubling times and do not wish to interrupt their routine”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the above reasons, I dismissed the PPO application.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife’s “Documents and Evidence Checklist” dated 24 July 2024 (“<b>C2</b>”) at page 8 (12:05 pm to 1.11 am) and page 13 (1.12 am to 1.14 am).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>These incidents are described in exhibit <b>C3.</b></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>As stated earlier, the Wife had wanted to admit evidence regarding several alleged incidents of family violence allegedly committed by the Husband from 2021 to 29 September 2024 that were not documented in either C1 or C2.

I heard the application on 4<sup>th</sup> October 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties were married on 17 December 2008. Almost a decade later, they welcomed their first son into their family. Four years later, in 2021, their second son was born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The details as to how exactly the marriage broke down are murky, but what is clear is that the Wife filed for divorce on 19 June 2023. Interim Judgment was granted on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 2023 on the basis of the Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties then set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. It is in this context that the Husband had taken out SUM 2758. He was represented, at the hearing, by Mr Michael Han (“Mr Han”). The Wife, on the other hand, was unrepresented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the hearing, Mr Han highlighted that some of the documents sought had been produced by the Wife during mediation. The Wife, however, declined to produce those documents at the voluntary disclosure stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As I had pointed out to Mr Han, I did not think it was open to me to take this into account – whatever had been raised in mediation should remain in mediation. I thus proceeded to assess SUM 2758 on its merits, taking into account any documents which the Wife may have disclosed in her affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I shall deal first with the items relating to interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the hearing, Mr Han indicated that the Husband was no longer pursuing Items 4 and 5 of the interrogatories. As such, I will not deal with them. These were the remaining interrogatories that the Husband wanted the Wife to answer:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1    In whose name is the motor vehicle bearing the registration number of SNM xxx registered under.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">When was the motor vehicle purchased, how much is the outstanding loan, if any, what is the monthly instalment payments, and what is the current market value of the motor vehicle?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2    What are the surrender value(s) of the various insurance policies as listed therein? (with reference to paras 10(a) – (f) of the Wife’s AOM)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3    Whether the Plaintiff had invested in cryptocurrencies or any related investment of the same nature?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If yes, when were they purchased, the amount they were purchased for, what is the current balance/holdings and what is the market (trading) value of the investment(s)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6    Whether [X] has a company account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If yes, please provide details of the bank account number, balances and statements from January 2020 to August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife is the sole director-shareholder of [X], a company incorporated in Singapore that carries on a business as a travel agency. The interrogatories which the Husband pursues relates to information concerning the Wife’s assets and finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife does not dispute that she had not answered any of these interrogatories. Her real quarrel was whether she <em>should</em> have to answer them. She says that she should not have to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In my judgment, these interrogatories (above at [8]) are all relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. They go towards issues such as maintenance, determining the extent of the Wife’s assets and assessing which assets fell into the matrimonial pool, and the value of assets included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request for the Wife to answer the interrogatories as set out in Items 1, 2, 3, and 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I turn now to deal with the items relating to discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Item 1 was a request for the Wife to produce financial documents in relation to the company [X] of which she was the sole director. These included documents such as financial statements, the balance sheet, as well as all company bank account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The principles relating to the disclosure of company documents are set out in the decision of the High Court in <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery)</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194. In deciding whether to order disclosure, the court must consider whether the spouse has control over the company such that they are able to produce the documents sought: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the present case, the ACRA statement discloses that the Wife is the sole director and sole shareholder of [X]. It is clear that the Wife has control over the company such that she will be able to produce the documents that the Husband is asking for. I also add that these documents are certainly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters – they will allow the shares of [X] to be valued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I therefore allow the request in Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Item 2 was a request for the Wife to produce documentation relating to the insurance policies listed in her Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) and statements of their respective surrender values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Mr Han explained that while the Wife had, in her AOM, disclosed some documents relating to the insurance policies, those documents did not disclose their surrender values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I will allow the request in Item 2. These documents are relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would show, amongst other things, the surrender values of these insurance policies – this would have a bearing on issues such as the valuation of assets that are included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Item 3 was a request for official payslips from X for the period January to June 2024. Mr Han had narrowed the period of disclosure that the Husband was seeking, taking into account the fact that the Wife had already disclosed some of her payslips from X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I will allow the request in Item 3. The Wife’s payslips are certainly relevant and necessary to determining issues such as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Items 4 and 5 was a request for the following bank statements for the period April 2023 to June 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     POSB Everyday Savings Account ending -9;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     UOB One Account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Mr Han noted that the Wife had disclosed her statement in respect of both accounts for the month of May 2024. He clarified that the Husband was only seeking the Wife’s bank statements for April 2023 to June 2024, excluding the month of May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I will allow the request in Items 4 and 5. The bank statements are relevant and necessary in that they shed light on the Wife’s finances in the months leading up to the filing of the divorce and after the grant of the interim judgment. This would have a bearing on issues such as whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets, or maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Item 6 was a request for CPF transaction history for the past 1 year from April 2023 to June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I will allow the request. This document is indeed relevant and necessary. It will shed light on the Wife’s earning capacity (see <em>AAE v AAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/64155-M.xml')\">[2009] 3 SLR 827</a> at [19]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Item 7 was a request for the Wife’s Notice of Assessment from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) for the past 4 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I do not think the relevance and necessity of the Wife’s IRAS statements can be seriously disputed – it will go towards showing her income, and will have a bearing on issues such as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I will therefore allow the request in Item 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I come now to Item 8. This was a request for documents relating to a car allegedly belonging to the Wife. The Husband had pursued an interrogatory in relation to this car (see [8] above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I will allow the request in Item 8. The documents sought would go towards showing whether the car indeed belonged to the Wife, and the value of the said car, taking into account any loans and payments made towards insurance. This would have a bearing on issues such as determining the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall answer Items 1, 2, 3, and 6 of the interrogatories as set out in Annex A of SUM 2758, on affidavit, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Annex A of SUM 2758, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her custody, power or possession, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by the 8<sup>th</sup> of November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I shall hear parties on costs. Submissions on costs shall come in by way of letter, and shall be limited to a maximum of 3 pages each. This is to be done no later than 25 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It remains for me to thank Mr Han for his able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Claim dated 19 June 2023.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence","Family Law – Family Violence – Orders for protection"],"date":"2024-10-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 972/2024","title":"XEZ v XFA","citation":"[2024] SGFC 96","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32407-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in-person and unrepresented","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-11-08T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XEZ v XFA</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEZ <em>v</em> XFA </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32407-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 96</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 972/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">09 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in-person and unrepresented; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XEZ — XFA </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Orders for protection</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">9 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 972/2024 was the Wife’s application against the Husband for a personal protection order (“PPO”). The Wife also sought a PPO for her two sons: [A], who is 19 years old, and [B], who is 13 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over two days in the months of September and October. Having heard the evidence and considered the matter, I dismissed the Wife’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       To obtain a PPO, it is trite law that the applicant must prove the following two elements on a balance of probabilities (<em>CSW v CSX</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 204; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27616-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 47</a> at [26] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a>). First, that “family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961. As to what family violence is, that is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In addition to this, the second element an applicant must also establish is that the PPO is necessary for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife relies on the following two incidents in support of her application for a PPO for herself and her two sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The first incident took place on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 2024. This was the Wife’s evidence as to what had happened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On that day, the Wife realised that she had run out of condensed milk. The Husband said that he would give her money to buy some condensed milk. The Wife told her younger son, [B], to take the Husband’s card and she would head out to purchase a tin of condensed milk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife complained about having to go through so much difficulty to get some milk for her tea. She began to talk disrespectfully to the Husband. This provoked the Husband. He responded in a disrespectful manner, and also raised his hand in a fist towards her – though he did not hit her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband then angrily kicked a plastic vase. There was a remote control, amongst other items, in the plastic vase. The contents of the plastic vase scattered all over the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife called the police. They arrived on the scene and took their statements. The Wife explained that in the police statement, she had said that the remote control in the plastic vase had hit her – this was inaccurate – none of the items contained in the vase had hit her when the Husband kicked it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband’s evidence was materially the same. He explained that the Wife was kicking up a fuss over not being able to get condensed milk. The Wife had asked [B] to purchase a tin. The Husband told [B] that he did not have cash, and gave [B] his ATM card instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife was still unhappy. She continued to complain. Frustrated, the Husband confronted her. He pointed his finger at her and asked: “I give you money already why you still making noise”. In his anger, he kicked the plastic vase, but he did not see if anything had hit the Wife because it was dark. The Husband explained that he was angry because the Wife had kept nagging at him even after he had given [B] his ATM card to go buy some condensed milk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I had also heard evidence from [B] who had witnessed the quarrel between his parents. He said that he saw the Husband shouting at the Wife. He also said that he saw that the Husband looked like he was going to hit the Wife, but he did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to the second incident complained of. This took place on 13 September 2023. The Wife’s evidence was that she had gotten into an argument with the Husband over phone calls made by his family members. She said that the Husband’s family members had been asking about her visa status. She told the Husband to cut off all contact with his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband refused and shouted at her. A heated argument ensued. The Wife says that she could not bear being shouted at loudly and fainted. When she came to, she realised that she had been sent to hospital via ambulance. She told the doctors and nurses that she did not want to go back as she was afraid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife says that she did not want to create trouble for the medical staff. She asked to be discharged and went to the police station.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s evidence is, once again, materially similar. He said that there was a dispute between the two of them. The Wife was unhappy that he was still keeping in touch with his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     He had asked for the Wife’s brother to be present, so as to help mediate their dispute. The Husband said that the Wife kept nagging at him. He told her in a loud tone to wait – this caused the Wife to faint. His elder son, [A], called the ambulance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     [B] also gave evidence in relation to this incident. He said that he could not remember all that much, though he did see the Wife faint. He said that he called the ambulance, although the Husband had told him not to do so because it was not a serious issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In my judgment, the Husband had not committed any acts that fell within the definition of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 in both incidents that the Wife had complained of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In relation to the incident that took place on 16 May 2024, the Wife has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband had indeed raised a fist towards her during the course of their heated argument. I place little weight on her account of events that took place on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For one, there was a discrepancy between what the Wife had said in the police report dated 19 May 2024, and what she had subsequently said in her testimony. In that report, the Wife says that Husband had kicked the plastic vase – there was a remote in the plastic vase which flew out and hit her in the stomach. In her testimony during trial, however, the Wife stated that the remote control had never made contact with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It bears noting that this discrepancy is found in a police report made when the events were still fresh in the Wife’s mind. That there was such a discrepancy in the contemporaneous record of the incident cast doubt on the veracity of the tale which the Wife had told (for the general evidential value of a police report in the context of a PPO trial, see <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Compounding this was the fact that the Wife only clarified that the remote control never hit her when I had asked her about it. Prior to this, the Wife’s testimony had only focussed on what the Husband had allegedly done during the quarrel – which was to raise his fist towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I add that although [B] had given evidence that the Husband “looked like he was about to hit” the Wife, I do not place much weight on his evidence. Having seen [B] in person and heard his testimony, I cannot discount the fact that his recollection of events might have been influenced by the Wife – indeed the Husband had testified that the Wife was trying to alienate both his sons from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even taking the Wife’s case at its highest, and assuming that the Husband did raise his fist at her, this act would not, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence, specifically, limb (a) of s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (see above at [3]). The act complained of had taken place amidst a heated quarrel – if the Husband had indeed raised his fist, it was likely an expression of his frustration rather than an attempt to place the Wife in fear of hurt (to borrow the language of limb (a) of the definition of family violence in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife has thus failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an act of family violence committed towards her on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 2024. The Wife has also not shown that the Husband had committed an act of family violence towards either of his two sons – indeed, this incident merely concerned a quarrel between the Husband and the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I turn now to the second incident which took place on 13 September 2023. Again, the Wife has not shown that the Husband had committed family violence. It is undisputed that there was a heated quarrel between the both of them, and that the Wife had fainted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing whether there had been an act of family violence, it is also important to consider the context in which those acts took place. In the course of a heated argument, tempers may flare, and voices may be raised. This was, in my judgment, exactly what had happened during this incident that had taken place on 13 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Therefore, the Husband’s act of shouting, or raising his voice at the Wife in the course of a heated quarrel, when viewed in its proper context, does not constitute family violence as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I add that, given that neither of the two sons were involved in this incident, I do not find that the Husband had committed an act of family violence towards them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In addition, I also find that the Wife had not shown that family violence was <em>likely</em> to be committed on her, or her two sons. The two incidents complained of were, in my judgment, examples of disputes that may arise between couples. There was no evidence to show that the Husband was a violent or abusive man – indeed, the evidence pointed to the opposite conclusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For one, the Wife had given evidence that when [A] was in kindergarten, the Husband had hit him for leaving toys on the ground. She intervened and told the Husband to not hit their children. The Husband had listened and refrained from hitting them since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In this vein, the Wife’s own account was that she had a loving relationship with the Husband until her mother had passed away in 2019. She told me that she would work out her differences with her Husband by talking. She shared that while they had little in terms of material wealth, that was fine since they had each other and were able to make compromises. However, since her mother’s passing, she felt that the Husband’s own family was trying turn him against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Viewed in this light, the inference which I drew was that the Wife has had difficulty coping with, and moving on from her mother’s passing. She became increasingly paranoid – indeed, throughout her testimony and oral closing submissions, she emphasised repeatedly that the Husband’s family was trying to turn him against her, and that she did not have anyone else for support. Consequently, this changed the dynamic of her relationship with her Husband, giving rise to quarrels that formed the basis for her application for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Yet despite the currently strained relationship between the Wife and her Husband, I can find no evidence that the Husband had, or is likely to commit family violence.

When drafting a clause to prohibit child access from being conducted in the presence of non-family members, how can a balance be struck between the needs for <em>practicality</em> and <em>child safety</em>? These are some of the issues to be addressed in this judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff (“<b>Father</b>”) and Defendant (“<b>Mother</b>”) were married in 2015 and have an eight-year-old daughter (D.O.B. 6 June 2016) (“<b>Daughter</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In 2023, the Father commenced divorce proceedings. In the same year, interim judgement for divorce was entered and ancillary matters orders were made by consent in FC/ORC 5452/2023 (“<b>AM Order</b>”). Under the AM Order, the Mother was given care and control of the Daughter with access granted to the Father. The dissolution of the marriage was made final in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       About seven months after the AM Order was made, the Father sought to vary it in the following manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, to allow the Father to be the Daughter’s caregiver instead of the Mother. (“<b>Prayer 3</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If Prayer 3 was disallowed – then to vary the terms of the child access. <em>First</em>, by allowing the Father to carry out the access in the presence of non-family members. (“<b>Prayers 4 and 5</b>”) <em>Second</em>, by increasing the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to him for access. (“<b>Prayer 6</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       For completeness, the Father had also sought to vary the terms of the sale of the matrimonial flat under the AM Order (“<b>Prayers 1 and 2</b>”). However, by the time application came before me, the matrimonial flat had already been sold. As such, Prayers 1 and 2 were rendered moot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Governing provisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Prayers 3 to 6 are governed by s 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). That provision prescribes three circumstances in which orders on care and control as well as access may be varied. According to s 128 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody of a child on the application of any interested person, (1) where it is satisfied that <em>the order was based on (a) misrepresentation or (b) mistake of fact or (2) where there has been any material change in circumstances</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis and text in round brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Father relied on a “material change in circumstances” as the legal basis for Prayers 3 to 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       When applying s 128, it is essential to also note s 125(2) of the Charter. This provision sets out the <em>overriding</em> consideration when assessing whether a variation is appropriate:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, <em>the paramount consideration</em> is to be <em>the welfare of the child</em> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">What the Father must prove</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Given the above, the Father must prove the following for his application to succeed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there had been a “change in circumstances” since the AM Order was made in December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the change in circumstances is “material”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, Prayers 3 to 6, whichever is applicable, would better serve the Daughter’s welfare and interests than what had been provided in the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Outcome</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I made the following decision after considering the evidence and submissions:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"14.6%\"><col width=\"65.36%\"><col width=\"20.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Prayer</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Nature of application</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Outcome</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To switch the Daughter’s caregiver from the Mother to the Father.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Dismissed</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4 and 5</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To allow the Father to carry out the access in the presence of non-family members.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Allowed in part</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">To increase the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to the Father for access.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Allowed in part</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 3</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I begin with Prayer 3. The Father submitted that there had been two material changes in circumstances since the AM Order was made, and that these changes necessitated the switch of the Daughter’s caregiver from the Mother to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The first material change involved his discovery of certain photos of the Daughter posted on social media.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Father, sometime in the last week of June 2024, he discovered on the Twitter feed of one “Anushka De Melo” a photo showing the Daughter “with her legs spread towards the camera and a suggestive ‘kiss’ emoji” covering her groin area (“<b>Offensive Photo</b>”). According to the Father, there were other photos showing the Daughter “lying in the arms of strangers including a man”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father submitted that the Mother had failed to protect the Daughter’s interests – <em>first</em>, by allowing others to take her photos in an inappropriate pose, and <em>second</em>, by failing to have these photos removed from online posts. According to the Father, “[t]here are many paedophiles and predators in the world and on internet, who will undoubtedly download and abuse these photographs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father submitted that the second material change in circumstances was the Mother’s efforts to frustrate his child access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father alleged that the Mother had handed the Daughter to his sister (“<b>Sister</b>”) as purported compliance with the access order. (This was despite the Mother knowing that the Father and the Sister were not on speaking terms.) As a result, he had to spend an additional 30 mins to travel to his parents’ house (where the Sister had brought the Daughter to) to see the child. Without consulting the Father, the Mother would also communicate directly with the Sister to make plans for the Daughter during the access times and to swap access dates.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father submitted that he should be made the Daughter’s caregiver since the Mother had deliberately interfered with his child access. He relied on <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (“<b><em>ABW</em></b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> to support this submission. In that case, the High Court affirmed the district judge’s decision to make the mother the caregiver because the children had grown estranged from her while under the father’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother submitted that there had <em>not</em> been any material change in circumstances since the AM Order was made in 2023. Her responses to the Father’s specific allegations were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>The photos</u> <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The photos were taken in 2020/2021. The Father had failed to prove that he had discovered them after the AM Order was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There was nothing sinister with the photos and online postings – (i) “Anushka De Melo” is a female relative, (ii) The photos were taken with the Mother’s family members, (iii) The Mother was present during the photo-taking, and (iv) The Daughter was comfortable with her photos being taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Frustration of child access</u> <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother did not act improperly in letting the Sister and other members of the Father’s family pick the Daughter up for child access. This was in accordance with a “long standing practice” between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There were occasions when the Father was late for – and even missed – contact time with the Daughter. The Mother was the one who reminded him about the access periods and events that he should be attending with the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother submitted that it would not be in the Daughter’s interests for the Father to be the caregiver:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother had all along been the Daughter’s primary caregiver. The Father, on the other hand, had never taken care of the child for extended periods of time by himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father was an unreliable parent. After the divorce, he had entrusted the responsibility of caring for the Daughter during access times to his parents and the Sister. Furthermore, the Father was often late for his contact times. Sometimes, he even missed them altogether. Additionally, the Father had breached the AM Order by leaving the Daughter alone with non-family members on two occasions while he attended to other matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had failed to disclose his plans for caring the Daughter if he were made her caregiver. For instance, he did not provide any information on (i) whether the Daughter would be staying with other tenants at his premises, (ii) whether she would continue to attend her current primary school, (iii) how the child would commute to school, and (iv) who would care for her if he was unavailable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If the Father were made the caregiver, he would likely cut off the Daughter from her. This was because he had proposed only “reasonable access” to the Mother – without stating the details of such access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To address the purported access issues raised by the Father, the Mother submitted that the proper approach should be to vary the <em>terms of child access</em> – not the care and control order. In support of this submission, she referred to the case of <em>VSL v VSM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26653-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 33</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Prayer 3 turned on whether the grounds raised by the Father come within the phrase “material change in circumstances” under s 128 of the Charter. As stated in [9] above, there are two parts to this phrase. <em>First</em>, that there has been a “change in circumstances”. <em>Second</em>, that the change is “material”. At this juncture, I pause to make some observations regarding these two parts of the phrase.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Change in circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On its plain meaning, “change in circumstances” can be understood as referring to a change in the conditions and facts that relate to and affect a situation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> A review of the cases shows that such a change typically involves –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A change in the circumstances <em>of the parents or the child</em>. For examples, see <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> at [26] and [27]; <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (“<b><em>AZB</em></b>”) at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A change in the parent-parent and parent-child <em>relationship</em>. For examples, see <em>VDX v VDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25522-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 2</a> at [25]; <em>ABW</em> at [29]; <em>AZB</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Any other change that affects the workability or practicality of the care and control order. For examples, see <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> at [25]; <em>WCU v WCV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27450-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 38</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Material change</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Under s 128 of the Charter, the change in circumstances must be “material” before a variation is permissible. The word “material” is synonymous with “significant” and “substantial”. Thus, to qualify as a “<em>material</em> change in circumstances” under s 128, the change must be significant/substantial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It bears highlighting that courts have taken a “principled and pragmatic approach” in determining whether there has been a “material change in circumstances”. For instance, it has been held that such a change can be found to exist even if an applicant cannot pin-point “one particular identifiable event” that marks the time when the material change in circumstances has taken place: <em>AZB</em> at [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">“Discovery” of the photos</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having determined how the phrase “material change in circumstances” is to be understood, I return to the facts in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father submitted that the “discovery” of the relevant photos qualified as such a change.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I am unable to agree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25      <em>First</em>, I accepted the Mother’s submission that there were doubts regarding whether the Father had discovered the photos only after the AM Order was made. For instance, it was unclear whether he was a “follower” of “Anushka de Melo”, the person who had posted most of the photos – including the Offensive Photo. According to the Mother, this person was a relative. If the Father was a follower, then why did he not discover the photos earlier? If the answer is no, then how did he stumble across them? Did the Father discover the photos through a third party? If so, why did he not reveal that person’s identity was so that his evidence could be verified? It bears highlighting that (a) the belated discovery of the photos was an essential basis for Prayer 3, (b) the alleged discovery was mysterious, (c) the Father could easily have cleared the doubts, and (d) he had the burden to prove the alleged “change in circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26      <em>Second</em>, even if the Father did discover the photos after the AM Order, such a discovery did not come within the typical scenarios that have been judicially recognised as being a “change in circumstances”: see [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27      <em>Third</em>, the relevant photos were taken about three to four years <em>before</em> the AM Order was made. Put in another way, these photos were already in existence at the time of the order. To constitute a “change in circumstances”, the <em>change</em> must logically be something which had arisen only <em>after</em> the AM Order was made. A fact which had existed when the AM Order was made (i.e., the photos) – but was discovered thereafter – would not logically qualify as a change in circumstances. If authority is needed for this proposition, see <em>VWK v VWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27000-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 130</a> at [58]; <em>UKX v UKY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21579-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 31</a> at [15] and [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28      <em>Finally</em>, and in any event, I disagreed with the Father’s submission that by failing to have the photos removed from the posts of “Anushka De Melo”, the Mother had shown herself to be an irresponsible parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I did not find the relevant photos objectionable. They show the Daughter in family/relaxed settings. (According to the Mother, “Anushka De Melo” as well as the persons in the photos were all her relatives. I see no reason to doubt her evidence.) There is nothing sinister or lewd about the Offensive Photo. The person who posted it (a female) had clearly intended to use the emoji to protect the Daughter’s modesty, albeit in a cheeky way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite the above, the Father submitted that the photos ought to have been removed because “[t]here are many paedophiles and predators in the world and on internet, who will undoubtedly download and abuse these photographs”. I find this submission to be unreasonable. Going by the Father’s reasoning, then parents should not be posting their children’s photos on social media platforms, and those who do would be acting irresponsibly and unfit to be caregivers. This cannot be correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It bears highlighting that the photos were posted <em>years before</em> the Father commenced divorce proceeding. At the time of the AM Order in 2023, he had consented to the Mother being the Daughter’s caregiver. This clearly showed that from the time the photos were posted till the AM Order, there was nothing to suggest to the Father that the Mother was an irresponsible parent. Otherwise, he would not have agreed for her to be the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For the above reasons, I found that the Father’s “discovery” of the relevant photos did not constitute a “material change in circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alleged frustration of child access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I now turn to the Father’s second ground for varying the AM Order – i.e., his allegation that the Mother had been frustrating his child access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I found this allegation to be utterly devoid of merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father did not adduce any objective/contemporaneous evidence to support his bare allegation. If the Mother had been frustrating his child access, there would have been evidence of this, e.g., in WhatsApp messages between the Mother and him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, the Mother had adduced numerous WhatsApp exchanges between the Father and herself – from 2021 to May 2024 – which showed the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Mother had been <em>reminding</em> the Father about his contact time with the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Mother had been <em>proactively</em> informing the Father of the Daughter’s graduation ceremony and parent-teacher meetings and asking if he would be attending.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Mother had been messaging the Father <em>directly</em> to check who would be picking the Daughter from her residence for child access.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)       There were occasions when the Father had arranged for the Sister or other family members to fetch the Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     According to the Sister, the Father had not been exercising his access rights regularly.

This is because these submissions are supported by contemporaneous WhatsApp messages, the Sister’s evidence, and/or are not disputed by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Additionally, I had also considered the following which favoured maintaining the status quo of the Mother being the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From the evidence, the Mother had clearly shown greater concern, interest and responsibility for the Daughter than the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Daughter had been enjoying a stable home environment under the Mother’s care. Despite the divorce, the Daughter had been able to maintain a healthy relationship with her paternal relatives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being: <em>ABW</em> at [20] and [21]. If the Father was made the caregiver, the Daughter would be uprooted from a familiar caregiver and home environment – without any evidence that the Father would (i) be able to take better care of her or (ii) be available when she needs him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, it was clear from the WhatsApp messages that the Mother was committed to ensuring a healthy relationship between the Daughter and the Father. There is no similar evidence from the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     For the above reasons, I dismissed Prayer 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I now come to the Father’s alternative application, i.e., for the terms of his access in the AM Order be varied. The Father requested two variations to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayers 4 and 5 </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s position<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The first variation involved deleting from the AM Order the following condition to child access:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> (“<b>non-family members clause</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father submitted that the deletion was needed so that he could get “unfettered access” to the Daughter and to prevent the Mother from interfering with his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To show that the non-family members clause was unduly restrictive, the Father gave the examples of him bringing the Daughter to a McDonald’s fast-food outlet or to a tuition centre. According to him, such conduct would be in breach of the clause. This was because there would be strangers (non-family members) at these places.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s position<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother objected to the deletion of the non-family members clause. She submitted that the Father had failed to prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, that there had been a material change in the circumstances since the making of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, that the Mother had used the non-family members clause to refuse to hand over the Daughter to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, that the deletion of the clause would be in the Daughter’s welfare. The Mother was worried for the Daughter’s safety during access periods. She felt that the non-family members clause would prevent the Father from leaving the child alone with strangers, especially unknown men.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, the Mother was prepared to be flexible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She recognised that the Father was in a serious relationship with another woman (“<b>partner</b>”) and intended to marry her eventually. In the circumstances, she appreciated that it would be in the Daughter’s interests to have a relationship with the partner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, the Mother was prepared to give her consent for other non-family members to be present during the access periods on the condition that the Father (i) informed her of the location of his access, (ii) provided details regarding the other people who would be present, and (iii) allowed her to contact the Daughter during such access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Given the above, the Mother counter-proposed that the non-family member clause be varied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Save for the Plaintiff’s romantic partner</u>, the <del>The Plaintiff’s</del> access shall not be in the presence of non-family members, <u>unless the Plaintiff obtains the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties have valid concerns</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Father found the non-family members clause to be unduly restrictive and impractical. The Mother was worried for the Daughter’s safety during access periods. I found these concerns to be genuine and reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my view, the Father’s request to delete the non-family members clause entirely – without introducing any safeguards whatsoever – would only heighten the Mother’s concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mother’s proposed variation </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     With a view to an amicable resolution, the Mother had proposed a variation of the non-family members clause to address the Father’s concern. Under her proposed variation –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father could conduct the child access in the presence of his partner without seeking her prior consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Father wanted to conduct the child access in the presence on other non-family members, then the Mother’s prior consent in writing must be sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother deserved commendation for showing flexibility in coming up with her proposed variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issues with the proposed variation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     That said, I found that the Mother’s proposal did not go far enough. This is because under her proposed variation, the Father must seek her prior consent in writing if he wishes to bring the Daughter to fast-food outlets, playgrounds, shopping malls – and even HDB lifts and female toilets (should the need arises). In my view, it would be impractical for both parties if prior consent in writing had to be sought and provided in such circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Additionally, the Mother’s proposed variation can also unwittingly create more instances where misunderstanding and friction between the parties could arise – e.g., if the Mother is not able to see the Father’s request for consent, or give her consent, in good time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughter’s safety is the paramount consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It cannot be doubted that the Daughter’s safety is the paramount consideration. In my view, this becomes an issue if the Father were to (a) leave the child unattended, (b) place her in the care of non-family members (especially strangers), or (c) bring the child to places which do not serve her interests or welfare (e.g., a function organised by the Father’s friends/colleagues or a night establishment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Variation ordered</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Based on the above considerations, I varied the non-family members clause as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>ii</u>)    <u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[variation in underscore]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In my view, the above variation would allow the Father to carry out child access in the presence of non-family members in the following circumstances:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"57.74%\"><col width=\"42.26%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s prior written consent </b> <b><u>not </u></b> <b>needed</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s prior written consent needed</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(1) The Father’s partner</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Circumstances that do not fall within (1) and (2)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(2) Circumstances in [40] and [48] above</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In coming up with the clause in [51] above, I have sought to avoid the dangers of being over prescription.

This involved adding the following text at the end of clause 1(h) of the AM Order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That all of the Plaintiff’s access aforesaid shall be by way of –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    The Child’s arrival at the Plaintiff’s residence;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    By the Plaintiff picking up the Child directly; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    In any other manner as agreed by the Plaintiff personally and conveyed to the Defendant in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father’s intent behind the variation was to increase the number of ways in which the Daughter was to be handed over to him for access.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother’s position regarding the requested variation was as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.27834433113377%\"><col width=\"29.5140971805639%\"><col width=\"62.2075584883023%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father’s requests</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s position</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">For the Daughter to “arrive” at the Father’s residential address </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(“<b>Option 1</b>”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) It would not be feasible for the Daughter to expend time and energy to travel to an address specified by the Father for access. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) Instead, it would be more comfortable for the Daughter if the Father picked her up in his car.

It was not disputed that in practice, such handover typically took place at the Mother’s residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In my view, the Father’s formulation of the requested variation is problematic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother had objected to Option 1 as being not feasible for the Daughter. I found her objection to be reasonable. Due regard ought to be given to the Mother’s objection given that there was already an established manner of handover (i.e., at the Mother’s residence).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It bears highlighting that the three options for handover are all in the alternative (“or”). There is <em>no “default” mode</em> of handover among these options.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Furthermore, the Father’s formulation did not specify <em>which party</em> – i.e., whether the Father or the Mother – would be responsible for confirming the applicable mode on each occasion of handover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Given (b) and (c) above, there will be <em>a lot of uncertainty</em> each time the Daughter is to be handed over to the Father for access. Such uncertainty can result in anxiety and inconvenience to the parties. These concerns are real – especially when that the Father has a history of giving <em>last minute notices</em> to the Mother to delay or cancel the handover due to his work commitments. The uncertainty arising from the Father’s formulation of the requested variation can lead to misunderstanding, frustration and accusations between the parties – which can in turn affect the Daughter. This is not in the child’s interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I accepted the Mother’s proposed variation in [57] above.

S, a young adult, <em>plans to apply</em> for a course in a local university after his National Service (“<b>NS</b>”) ends in about two years’ time. Should S’s father be ordered to make payments to S, while he is still in NS, so that S can save up the money for the course? This is the issue in MSS No. 1404 of 2024 (“<b>MSS 1404</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the time of the hearing, the applicant (“<b>Son</b>”) (D.O.B.: 8 November 2002) was serving his NS. He planned to apply in February/March 2025 for a course run by the Singapore Institute of Technology (“<b>SIT</b>”). The outcome of such an application would only be made known in June/July 2025. If successful, the Son would commence the course only around August 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Son initiated MSS 1404 to compel the respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) to start paying $1,000/month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> while he is still in NS. The Son planned to use these payments to fund the SIT course (estimated at $30,000+). He commenced MSS 1404 because he believed that the Father had the funds and was concerned that they might be depleted when the course was due to start.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       During the hearing, the Father stated that he was surprised and “confused” by MSS 1404 – as the Son did not inform him of his plans to apply for an SIT course prior to the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       That said, the Father made it clear that he was fully prepared to pay the course fees. However, he was facing financial hardship at the material time, and he could start making the payments only from 2026 – i.e., when the course was expected to begin. The Father was prepared to tap into his monies in the Central Provident Fund (“<b>CPF</b>”) to pay the course fees. In this regard, he had about $240,000 in his CPF Ordinary Account – which would be more than enough to cover the fees. While he was prepared to pay the fees, the Father felt that his ex-wife (“<b>Mother</b>”) should be making contributions as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Governing provisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Section 69(2)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Son initiated MSS 1404 pursuant to s 69(2) of the Charter. According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court <em>may</em>, on due proof that a parent <em>has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance</em> for his or her child who is unable to maintain himself or herself, order that parent to pay monthly sums or a lump sum <em>for the maintenance of that child</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Section 69(5)(c)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       When applying s 69(2) to MSS 1404, it is essential to also consider s 69(5)(c) of the Charter. The latter provision states that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The court <em>shall not make</em> an order under subsection (2) for the benefit of a child <em>who has attained 21 years of age</em> or for a period that extends beyond the day on which the child will attain that age <em>unless</em> the court is satisfied that the provision of the maintenance is <em>necessary</em> because –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the child is or will be or (if an order were made under subsection (2)) <em>would be</em> receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not while in gainful employment,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I pause to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For MSS 1404 to succeed, the Son must prove two things. <em>First</em>, that the payments which he is seeking qualify as “reasonable maintenance”. <em>Second</em>, that the Father has “neglected or refused” to provide the maintenance sought: s 69(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As the Son “has attained 21 years of age”, a court may order the payments sought <em>only if</em> he “would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment”: s 69(5)(c).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In applying s 69(5)(c), the following bears highlighting. <em>First</em>, the Charter does not specifically oblige a parent to fund his/her child’s tertiary education. <em>Second</em>, the obligation to provide maintenance under s 69(2) does not require a parent to pay for all the expenses of a child’s tertiary education: <em>UYT v UYU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25733-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 539</a> at [12] and [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Ultimately, a court retains the discretion under s 69(2) (“may”) whether to order a parent to pay for his/her child’s tertiary education expenses – and if so, (i) <em>how much</em> of such expenses the parent should bear and (ii) <em>when</em> the payments ought to begin.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In my view, the Son had failed to prove that the payments sought are both “reasonable” (s 69(2)) and “necessary” (s 69(5)(c)). These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Requested payments are neither “necessary” nor “reasonable”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <em>First</em>, the Son had failed to satisfy the legal requirement that he “<em>would be</em> receiving instruction at an educational establishment” in due course. At the time of the hearing, he had not even applied for the SIT course yet. In deciding whether to allow MSS 1404, I cannot assume (a) that the Son will apply for the course in 2025, or (b) that he will be admitted into the course in 2026 (if the application is made). Clearly, if the Son does not make the application or is unsuccessful, then it is <em>not necessary</em> to pay the course fees at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Second</em>, MSS 1404 is in effect a request for maintenance to be paid <em>in advance</em>. I am unable to locate a precedent where such maintenance has been ordered. In my view, it is wrong in principle to allow the Son’s request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Courts order child maintenance base on what a child <em>needs</em> and not what the child (or his/her parents) <em>wants</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     MSS 1404 is contrary to the above well-established principle. This is because its purpose is <em>not</em> to secure funds to meet the Son’s <em>current financial needs</em>. Instead, the purpose of MSS 1404 is to advance his <em>aspirational goal</em> – by establishing an education fund that he can tap on sometime in the <em>future</em>, if he is admitted into the SIT course.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The situation in the present case is similar to <em>UAP v UAQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21471-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 319</a>. In that case, the High Court wisely declined to order maintenance to cover the son’s tertiary fees. This is because at the time of judgement, the son “had not yet decided on his college choice”. In the circumstances, the High Court found that to order “a specific sum for [a child’s] tertiary education was too remote”: judgement at [98].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Third</em>, ordering the Father to pay maintenance in advance will create raise a host of issues – given that there is no certainty that the Son will be admitted into the SIT course. For instance, if his application for the 2026 enrolment is unsuccessful, what will happen to the payments already made? Is the Son supposed to hold onto them until he is admitted into the course? What if he is not admitted any time soon – or at all? There can still be complications even if the Son is admitted into the course. For instance, if the course fees turn out to be higher than expected, will the Son have to make another application to increase the amount of payable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Fourth</em>, it bears highlighting that child maintenance is a <em>shared</em> parental duty. In other words, both the Father <em>and the Mother</em> have a joint responsibility in supporting the Son’s course fees. In this case, the Mother was apparently working as a freelance renovation contractor. To determine what their respective contribution towards the fees should be, it is necessary for me to consider, among others, the Father’s and Mothers’ relative income, earning capacity and assets (“<b>financial position</b>”). In this case, while I had the Father’s financial position,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I did not know the Mother’s position. In the absence of such information, I have no basis to find that the Father should be solely responsible for funding the Son’s course fees – without any financial contribution from the Mother whatsoever.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s financial circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I now come to the Son’s submission that the Father has the available funds to make the requested payments. This submission is based photos posted online by the Father’s second wife (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Wife</b>”). They were apparently posted in June/July 2024 and show that she had a branded watch and bag, and was counting stacks of cash.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I am not persuaded by the Son’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, as shown in [10] above, the Son was unable to cross the legal threshold for ordering maintenance. He was also unable to show that his application for maintenance in advance is consistent with settled jurisprudence. In the circumstances, the Son’s belief that the Father had sufficient funds is neither here nor there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, the Son did not adduce any evidence to show that the Father had the relevant funds at the time of the hearing. His belief that the Father had such funds was based on speculation – namely a watch, a bag and cash in the possession <em>of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife</em>. According to the Father, the watch and bag were bought several years ago – the watch in 2018 (by him) and the bag in 2019 (by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife). The Father added that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Wife and him kept their finances separate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the following evidence – which was not disputed by the Son – in fact shows that the Father was in dire financial straits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the time of the hearing, the Father was indebted to five banks and was on various repayment plans to discharge these debts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> According to the Father, these debts were incurred while running his construction business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       About one year before the hearing (i.e., in September 2023), the Father had traded in his 2021 Mercedes E Class (valued at about $400,000) for a 15-year-old Mercedes S Class (valued at about $50,000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father had not been timely in paying child maintenance (total: $2,500) for the Son and daughter, and would pay the arrears in sums of $3,000 and $5,000 when he could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Given the above, I accepted the Father’s submission that allowing MSS 1404 will add to his current financial hardship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For the above reasons, I dismissed MSS 1404.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the hearing, the Father did not express any anger towards the Son for having hauled him to court over MSS 1404. At all material times, he spoke tenderly to the Son. At the beginning of the hearing, the Father had in fact addressed the Son as “Dear” – before he quickly corrected himself and addressed the Son by his English name. From my observation of the Father, it is clear to me that he loved the Son dearly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     At the end of the hearing, the Father was visibly and genuinely sad that the Son had turned to the law to compel him to fund the SIT course. According to the Father, the Son had not called him for a long time, and the first time that he came to know of the latter’s intention to pursue an SIT course was on receiving MSS 1404. The Father teared when he stressed that he was prepared to help the Son – “not because the law says so” – but as a parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Son should remember the Father’s love and words. The law is a blunt tool and has its limits. Experience has shown that issues achieve better outcomes through honest and direct communication. Whatever may have been the reasons for the apparent lack of communication between the Son and Father, it is never too late to press the reset button.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In this regard, the Son’s aspiration to pursue tertiary education can be a good opportunity for him to reconnect with the Father. In my view, the Father sincerely wants to make the Son to be a better man than he is – including by providing the latter a tertiary education that he (the Father) did not have. I urge the parties to start communicating directly with each other.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>During the hearing, the Son stated that he was open to receiving a lower amount – at least $500/month to $600/month – if this is deemed more appropriate.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>This information is in the Father’s statement dated 10 September 2024 (exhibit R1).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Son’s statement dated 17 August 2024 at pages 127 to 131.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>For details, see Father’s statement dated 10 September 2024 (exhibit R1) at pages 24 to 34.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Divorce"],"date":"2024-10-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3563 of 2022","title":"XDH v XDI","citation":"[2024] SGFC 80","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32401-SSP.xml","counsel":["Thian Wen Yi and Charis Sim Wei Li(Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the plaintiff","Shen Luda Genesis (Pointer LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-11-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Patrick Tay Wei Sheng","html":"<root><head><title>XDH v XDI</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XDH <em>v</em> XDI </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32401-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 80</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 3563 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">29 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Patrick Tay Wei Sheng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Thian Wen Yi and Charis Sim Wei Li(Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the plaintiff; Shen Luda Genesis (Pointer LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XDH — XDI </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Divorce</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">29 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties were spouses. They had a child, who was nine years of age. They fell out and filed for divorce. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in January 2023.

The wife was a citizen of Singapore. They married in 2013 and had the child in 2015. Apart from a year between 2017 and 2018, when the family moved to Europe, the family lived in Singapore throughout the marriage.

They split their time with the child on the weekends, with the husband having the care of the child on Saturdays and the wife having the care of the child on Sundays. But the matrimonial relationship deteriorated further, and the spouses commenced divorce proceedings in August 2022. They split their time with the child further: each parent had the care of the child on alternate days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2022, the spouses agreed to share the custody of the child following their divorce. This agreement was recorded as a consent order of the Family Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In January 2023, interim judgment of divorce was granted on the facts that each spouse had behaved in ways that made it unreasonable to expect the other spouse to continue to live with him or her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In July 2023, the wife moved out of the matrimonial home and took the child with her. They moved into another apartment within the same residential development as the matrimonial home. The husband continued to live in the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       A court in dividing matrimonial assets was tasked with justly and equitably apportioning the economic fruits of the marriage between the former spouses (see <em>VIG v VIH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25105-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 16</a> at [35]). In discharging that task, the court would first identify the assets (and liabilities) that constituted the pool of matrimonial assets then value those assets (and liabilities) to determine the economic fruits of the marriage. Having done so, the court would divide these economic fruits between the spouses based on their financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage, in line with the philosophy that marriage was an equal partnership (see <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL v TNK</em>”) at [45]). To give effect to that philosophy, “mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership” (see <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Identification of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Here, there were no assets that were held by the spouses jointly. The only relevant assets (and liabilities) were thus those that were held by each spouse solely in his or her name (or jointly with non-parties to the marriage). I list these assets and the positions of each spouse on the values of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Based on these submissions, there were four main areas of disagreement between the spouses. These were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the value of the husband’s DBS and OCBC (Bonus+) accounts and wife’s DBS account that were in each of their sole names;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the status of the wife’s DBS account that she held jointly with her mother and the value of the account if it was a matrimonial asset;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the status of the wife’s watches and the value of the watches if they were matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the status of the wife’s debt to her aunt and the value of the liability if it was a matrimonial liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Bank accounts in sole names of husband and wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The divergence between the spouses over the value of the bank accounts concerned the date on which those bank accounts were valued. The husband valued those bank accounts as of the date of the interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, January 2023). The wife valued those bank accounts as of the date of these proceedings on the ancillary matters (<em>ie</em>, April 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [1], Choo Han Teck J observed that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets was typically the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. Nevertheless, bank account balances and Central Provident Fund account balances were be valued as of the date of the interim judgment. For such money accounts, the economic fruits of the marriage were the monies in the accounts rather than the accounts themselves. The quantum of the monies that represented the fruits of the marriage crystallised at the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. In consequence, except for run-of-the-mill expenses, sums expended by a spouse from these money accounts between the interim judgment and the hearing of the ancillary matters had to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets if the other spouse had a putative interest in the monies and had not consented to the expenditure (see <em>TNL v TNK</em> at [24]). Specifically, a spouse was not entitled to use matrimonial money to fund his or her legal costs, which were not daily or run-of-the-mill expenses (see <em>WTS v WTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32208-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 33</a> at [8]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I thus preferred the values put forward by the husband on these accounts: $239 for the DBS account in the name of the husband, $129,339 for the OCBC (Bonus+) account in the name of the husband, and $55,452 for the DBS account in the name of the wife. I also agreed with the husband that the matrimonial assets in his name had a value of $455,629.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Joint account between wife and her mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The husband submitted a DBS bank account that the wife owned jointly with her mother and that had a balance of $7,980 as of the date of the interim judgment was a matrimonial asset. The wife did not deny the existence of this bank account but suggested that she had no beneficial interest in the monies therein and/or that her mother was the beneficial owner of those monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As a joint owner of the bank account, the wife was entitled to the undivided whole of the monies in that account. Those monies were thus matrimonial assets. Insofar as the wife asserted that she had no beneficial interest in the account, it was incumbent on her to obtain a determination from the civil courts to that effect because the Family Court was unable to adjudicate on a claim by a third party to a putative matrimonial asset (see <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]). But there was no such determination before me. Nor was there any objective evidence to show that, despite her legal interest in the monies in the monies in that account, she had no beneficial interest in the monies in that account. I thus included that account in the pool of matrimonial assets and valued it at $7,980.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Watches of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The husband submitted that the wife owned two Longines watches and valued them at $4,721 based on their purchase prices. The wife did not dispute her ownership of these watches and did not offer any estimate of the value of these watches. The value of these watches, even if objectively modest, was not insubstantial relative to the value of the other matrimonial assets. I thus included these watches within the pool of matrimonial assets and valued them at $4,721.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">$100,000 debt of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The wife submitted that she owed $100,000 to her aunt, which debt was a matrimonial liability that had to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. She claimed that she had been compelled to borrow that sum in November 2022 because the husband had stopped maintaining her since February 2022. The husband disputed these claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The aunt deposed an affidavit in support of the claim that the wife had incurred a $100,000 matrimonial liability by borrowing that sum from her. The aunt added that she had loaned a total of $160,000 to the wife in two tranches: $100,000 on 17 November 2022 and $60,000 on 10 July 2023. The aunt exhibited a document dated 28 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> in which the wife “confirm[ed] and acknowledge[d]” a loan of $160,000 from the aunt. The aunt described this document as a “Debt Acknowledgement Note”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I placed little weight on this affidavit. Although the affidavit exhibited a bank statement that recorded a $100,000 disbursement from the aunt to the wife on 17 November 2022, it contained no contemporaneous documentation of any liability on the part of the wife in respect of that disbursement. The Debt Acknowledgement Note, which was the only document that purported to record an obligation to repay that disbursement, was created only eight months later. This record was belated, convenient, and self-serving. The aunt deposed that she had not procured a formal “loan agreement” on or around 17 November 2022 because there had been a “common understanding” of repayment and because the wife was “family”. But this claim sat uneasily with her procurement of such a formal “loan agreement” after the subsequent $60,000 disbursement. Indeed, up until 10 July 2023, which was the date of that $60,000 disbursement, the correspondence between the wife and the aunt did not reflect any expectation of repayment of the $100,000 disbursement or the $60,000 disbursement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Only on 28 July 2023, which was two weeks after the $60,000 disbursement did the wife sign the Debt Acknowledgement Note. It was thus unlikely that the $100,000 disbursement had created a liability on the part of the wife to the aunt. It was more likely that the $100,000 had been disbursed to the wife without any expectation of or obligation for its repayment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The absence of detail beyond the Debt Acknowledgement Note on how and when the $100,000 disbursement was to be repaid reinforced this conclusion that it had been made without any obligation for its repayment. Moreover, the Debt Acknowledgement Note itself was equivocal on any such repayment obligation. Therein, the wife simply stated that the monies “will be repaid when my parents sell their current house and manage to get the cash on hand, or a partial repayment may be paid earlier by myself the moment I am able to do so.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Such an equivocal undertaking fell short of establishing a liability of $100,000 on the part of the wife to the aunt. I was thus unable to include any such liability in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Valuation and division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Given my findings above, the value of the matrimonial assets in the name of the husband was $455,629 while the value of the matrimonial assets in the name of the wife was $71,815. Accordingly, in the aggregate, the value of the pool of matrimonial assets was $527,444.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     There was little dispute that for most of the marriage, the husband was the breadwinner while the wife was the homemaker. Further, the husband had given the wife a monthly allowance of $1,000 up until the wife found employment as a financial advisor in 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The wife admitted that the husband had financed the bulk of the matrimonial assets but claimed a 30% share of them based on her indirect contributions to their acquisition. She argued that pursuant to the structured approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em>, the direct contributions were 100:0 in favour of the husband, the indirect contributions were 40:60 in favour of herself, and the final ratio was thus 70:30 in favour of the husband. She submitted in the alternative that insofar as the marriage was a single-income one and <em>ANJ v ANK</em> did not apply, she should receive 25–35% of the matrimonial assets on the authority of <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (“<em>BOR v BOS</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The husband submitted that the matrimonial assets should be divided 80:20 in his favour. He explained that he had been more than just a breadwinner and had helped to care for the child while working a full-time job. He added that he had even taken on primary caregiving responsibilities in addition to his breadwinning role in the later years of the marriage, when the wife was focusing on embarking on a career in financial advisory services. He alleged too that the wife had in those later years of the marriage embarked on extra-marital affairs that compromised her homemaking and her care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In my judgment, this marriage was substantially a single-income marriage with the husband as the breadwinner and the wife as the homemaker. Even if the wife had started work as a financial advisor at the time of the divorce, that period of work was insignificant in the context of the nine-year marriage. The approach to the division of matrimonial assets in single-income marriages as set out in <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>BOR v BOS</em> was thus the appropriate one to take. Thereunder, the weight to be ascribed to indirect contributions would be proportionate to the length of the marriage. Hence, the final ratios of division ranged from 50:50 (in long single-income marriages of 25–35 years’ duration) to 75:25 in favour of the breadwinner (in shorter single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration). I reproduced the observations in <em>BOR</em> at [111]–[113].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">111    … In <em>TNL v TNK</em>, this court observed that the trend in long single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but different considerations may attach to short single-income marriages (at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <em>TNL v TNK</em> itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112    The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <em>TNL v TNK</em>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">113    We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <em>ATT v ATS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0859.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 859</a> at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <em>UGG v UGH (m.w.)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 25</a>, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <em>ABX v ABY and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0969.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 969</a>, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Here, the marriage was a short one of only nine years. For most of it, the husband had been the breadwinner while the wife had been the primary caregiver for the child. Yet the husband had, over and above his breadwinning, made significant indirect contributions to the family especially in the later years of the marriage. In the words of the wife, “Overall, the [husband] had indeed been a supportive spouse during those years prior to the Divorce Proceedings, for which I am grateful and I fully acknowledge”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> By contrast, as the wife recorded in her diary, she sent text messages to her male companion(s) “all the time”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and “g[a]ve up my time with my son” for those companion(s).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To be clear, I made no finding on the allegation that the wife had embarked upon extra-marital affairs. The grounds of this divorce were that the behaviour of each spouse had made it unreasonable to expect the other to continue to live with him or her (see [6] above). It was thus unnecessary to make any finding on extra-marital affairs here. The diary entries of the wife were relevant only insofar as they showed the time and energy that the wife had spent other than on her role as a full-time homemaker. Still, those expenditures of time and energy were extensive and would have distracted the wife from her homemaking duties. Taking account too that this marriage spanned only nine years, the indirect contributions of the wife were at the lower end of that of homemakers in single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration as set out in <em>BOR</em> (see [25] above). A just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets was thus 75% to the husband and 25% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child custody, care and control, and access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The spouses had since December 2022 agreed to share the custody of the child. They had also agreed to jointly make all applications for “Citizenship, Permanent Residency, Long Term Visa and/or any other immigration-related documents (save for travel visas) in any other jurisdiction on behalf of the Child” (see [5] above). I thus made no further order on the custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Each spouse sought the sole care and control of the child for the immediate future, even as the wife suggested that they could share the care and control of the child when the child was older. The wife submitted that she had been the primary caregiver for the child, particularly in the years after the child was born and in the months after the breakdown of the marriage. The husband agreed that the wife had been the primary caregiver for the child after the child was born but submitted that he had become the primary caregiver in the final years of the marriage when the wife was focused on embarking on a financial advisory career. He added that the fact that the wife was the primary caregiver for the child after the breakdown of the marriage should be disregarded because that was a <em>status quo</em> that the wife had engineered by removing the child from his care and depriving him of access to the child thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, each spouse had played an active role in the upbringing of the child, and the continued involvement of both parents in the care of the child conduced to the best interests of the child. Nevertheless, the spouses were adamant that an order of shared care and control would have been unworkable in the immediate future due to the animosity between them, and I saw no reason to disagree with this position. Hence, the interests of the child were best served by placing the child in the care and control of the parent that would best promote the co-parenting of the child. As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [82], “it is in a child’s best interests post-divorce for him to maintain a good relationship with both his parents.” Accordingly, “[t]he court, in deciding which parent to award care and control to, therefore generally takes into account the extent to which the prospective carer will maintain and facilitate the child’s relationship with the other parent.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At the outset, I placed little weight on the <em>status quo</em> that had arisen following the breakdown of the marriage, where the wife had been the primary if not the exclusive caregiver for the child. This was an artificial situation where the husband had been substantially excluded from the care for the child even as he lived in the same residential development as the child. At all times, the husband had been ready and willing to care for the child and would have cared for the child had he been permitted to do so. As the Family Court held in <em>UGO v UGR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20965-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 125</a> at [46], the significance of continuity of care in deciding the care and control of a child was diminished when the <em>de facto</em> non-care parent had been deprived of the opportunity to care for the child, especially when that <em>status quo</em> had been unilaterally created by the <em>de facto</em> care parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On the evidence, placing the child in the care and control of the husband would conduce to the co-parenting that promoted the best interests of the child. Even as the wife had cared for the child, she was prone to emotional instability that had hurt the child. In her diary, she lamented: “It’s getting harder to control my frustrations on long days and especially when I’m tired”, “I find myself saying certain things which I know aren’t good for him”, “I need to really ensure that I control my temper … The damage done to his self-esteem just ain’t worth it”, and “Maybe there is something wrong with me after all”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> These laments corroborated the claims of the husband that the wife would, when frustrated, taunt, scream, and hit child. These laments were also not inconsistent with the claims of the husband that the wife would make “racist, xenophobic and other insensitive remarks” about the Romanian heritage of the husband in front of the child that were “harmful for the Child’s esteem and identity since he is half-Romanian himself”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The husband deposed, and wife did not deny, that she would call him a “gypsy”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and a “foreigner” who should “go back home”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The text messages exchanged between the husband and the wife showed just as much. As much as the laments of the wife about her behaviour revealed her recognition of its adverse impact on the child, it was hardly reassuring for the purpose of care and control that she took few steps beyond such lamenting to improve her management of her emotions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Further, the male companionship that the wife enjoyed alongside her homemaking compromised her time with and care of the child. As she diarised, she communicated with her male companions “all the time”, left the home to meet them “impromptu”, and even had to “give up my time with my son” for them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He is back in SG today.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And texted me at 9am. 9.30am to be precise. Turns out that he wanted to meet me today! omg. I was definitely not expecting to meet him today, and for sure not expecting him to want to meet me either! I think he must really miss me gosh. :) :) :)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He was worried he would be tired and hence didn’t dare to commit, and wanted to surprise me instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(Night time now)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Found out why it was so impromptu that he wanted to meet – he got home and could not sleep. And his requests for me to <em>meet him and give up my time with my son</em> was just because he could not sleep due to jet lag. How disappointing. I had expected better and looks like I will be his social escort and pretend to be happy :)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Most worryingly, the wife appeared to have since July 2023 unilaterally removed the child from the care of the husband and neglected to facilitate the co-parenting that would have been in the best interests of the child. Still, she claimed that she had encouraged the child to spend time with the husband. She clarified that the husband had from July to September 2023 accompanied the child to and/or from school three to five times each week and spent “reasonable amount of time” with the child “for breakfast, showering, dinner, showering and settling down”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She added that despite her differences with the husband, she “kept a limited channel open with the Husband via Whats[A]pp for the sake of [the child]” by “unblock[ing] the Husband at specific times of the day to allow for communication on essential matters”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> But these clarifications showed that the child had scarce opportunity to spend time with the husband for meaningful durations. These clarifications showed too that the wife had, after seizing the <em>de facto</em> care and control of the child, insisted on parenting the child on only her terms and was unamenable to co-parenting the child with the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In comparison, the husband had despite his differences with the wife taken steps to ameliorate those differences and to promote the bond between the child and the wife. After discovering the time and energy that the wife had spent on male companionship outside the marriage, the husband went for therapy to manage his emotions and learn to co-parent the child despite the breakdown in the marital relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He maintained good terms with the relatives of the wife and encouraged the child to meet with them. Even after the wife removed the child from the matrimonial home in July 2023, he worked with the wife to ensure that the child was fed, washed, and clothed. The wife painted these interactions as her facilitation of access between the husband and the child. Yet these interactions were equally the product of the husband adjusting his schedule and working around the schedule of the wife to ensure that the needs of the child were not compromised, especially when the work and other commitments of the wife took her away from the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed: “switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent.” These observations were apposite here, where the <em>status quo</em> was the wife as the <em>de facto</em> care parent of the child. This <em>status quo</em> complicated the co-parenting of the child by interfering with the bond between the child and the husband. Placing the child in the care and control of the husband, who was a capable parent that placed the interests of the child before his differences with the wife, would facilitate the co-parenting that conduced to the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I was confident that any ensuing disruption to the <em>status quo</em> here would not prejudice the child for three reasons. First, the duration of the <em>status quo</em> was short: less than a year had elapsed since July 2023. Second, the husband had been immersed in the care of the child up until July 2023 and accompanied the child to and/or from school and over “breakfast, showering, dinner, showering and settling down” up until September 2023. Third, the husband had a viable plan to care for the child from day to day: his flexibility in his job enabled him to take care of the child when the child was not at school while his proposal to rent an apartment with multiple bedrooms near the child’s school would provide the child with a dedicated bedroom, study area, and play area. This would be more conducive for the child, who was a soon-to-be teenager, than sharing a room in an apartment with the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I thus placed the child in the sole care and control of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     To preserve the relationship between the wife and the child, I made generous orders for her access to the child. These orders were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife shall have access to the child on one day each weekend, and this day of access will alternate between Saturdays and Sundays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The wife shall have access to the child on half of the child’s school holidays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife shall have access to the child on all gazetted public holidays from 0930hrs to 2000hrs, other than on public holidays falling within the husband’s share of the school holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The wife shall have access to the child on the child’s birthday on every alternate year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To facilitate these access orders, I ordered the wife to pick the child up from and drop the child off at the residence of the husband for each access session. For the avoidance of doubt, I specified that the wife was free to travel with the child during her access sessions during the child’s school holidays. When the wife had communicated her travel plans to the husband, the husband was to provide the passport of the child to the wife seven days in advance of the departure date and the wife was to return the passport of the child to the husband three days after the return date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     To allow each parent to bond with the child when he or she did not have the physical care of the child, I also granted each parent virtual access to the child as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife shall have virtual access to the child three times each week, with the husband to facilitate such access; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband shall have virtual access to the child three times each week during the wife’s half of the school holidays, with the wife to facilitate such access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In my view, these orders would grant the wife the space to adjust to her new job as a financial advisor and work on managing her emotions without the responsibility of caring for the child from day to day. To that end, the fact that she had acknowledged that her expressions of frustration at the child had adversely impacted the child (see [32] above) was a good start. After she had settled into her new role as a financial advisor and gained the tools to manage her emotions are frustrations, it was open to her to apply for a variation of these care and control and/or access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The wife did not seek any order of maintenance for herself. I therefore declined to order the husband to maintain the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Given my decision to place the child in the sole care and control of the husband, I was not inclined to make any order of maintenance in respect of the child. The income of the husband dwarfed that of the wife. Based on their latest Notices of Assessment, the husband earned $174,900 per annum (or $14,575 per month) while the wife earned $34,956 per annum (or $2,913 per month). The husband was well able to maintain the child on his own. It was neither just nor equitable to order the wife to maintain the child, especially when she was finding her feet in her new job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Speaking extra-judicially, Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, Presiding Judge, Family Justice Courts, recently reiterated that parents working together, and not the court, were the best persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child (see “From Confrontation to Collaboration: A Decade in Transforming The Family Justice Paradigm”, Keynote Address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 delivered at Family Conference 2024 (3 September 2024) at paragraphs 27–28):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The centrality of parenting obligations was emphasised in <em>CVC v CVB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30092-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 28</a>. Citing s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter, the court observed that “parental responsibility [was] one of the most fundamental obligations of a married couple”. The corollary of this is that the court must naturally be the last resort for the resolution of parenting matters. As the Appellate Division of the High Court recently emphasised, “[i]nstead of litigating in the courts for the variation of orders, parents should endeavour to make adjustments by agreement to the care and access orders where necessary… While the court remains accessible to parties who require a resolution to disputes that they are unable to resolve despite their best efforts, we stress that this course of action should be the last resort”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parents must therefore intentionally endeavour to make parenting decisions for themselves instead of fighting it out in court. They must work on reducing conflict instead of expending energy and resources to disparage each other. A divorce does not mark the end of one’s parenting obligations. After all, <em>parents know their child best and are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child. The court is no substitute for a child’s parent, and the task of making decisions for a child should therefore be undertaken by the parents working together, rather than by the force of a court order.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Even as I prescribed detailed care and access orders to give the spouses clarity on their rights and obligations after the divorce, I emphasise that they are always welcome to agree to different care or access arrangements for the child, just as they had agreed to share the custody of the child. Any such amicable agreement would conduce to the best interests of the child more than any formal order of court.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Signed Consent Order dated 2/12/2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at p 25</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at p 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Aunt’s Affidavit at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [17]–[18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>2WAOM at [28(g)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>2HAOM562–563</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>2HAOM565</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>2HAOM551–567</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>H’s Subs at [44]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>1HAOM717–720</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>1HAOM at [218]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>2HAOM565</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [38(d)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>W’s Subs at [38(e)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>4HAOM at [11]–[12]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family violence – Orders for protection – Cross-applications – Approach to assessing whether family violence under the “continual harassment” limb in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 is likely to be committed","Evidence – Admissibility of evidence – Admission of further evidence during trial for personal protection order","Evidence – Proof of evidence – Both applicants for personal protection orders alleging that the other party has committed multiple acts of family violence – Whether a court must assess the credibility of each of these allegations before determining whether to issue personal protection orders","Evidence – Proof of evidence – Evidential value of police reports in proceedings for personal protection orders"],"date":"2024-10-25","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No. 864 of 2024 & SS No. 867 of 2024","title":"XEP v XEQ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 95","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32394-SSP.xml","counsel":["Wife and Husband in person."],"timestamp":"2024-11-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XEP v XEQ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XEP <em>v</em> XEQ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Under s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”), “family violence” covers the following types of conduct:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member. To prove family violence under this limb, the following must be established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The respondent has continually harassed the applicant intending or knowing that it is likely to cause the latter to suffer “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Thus, repetitive conduct that causes worry, emotional distress or annoyance can amount to “continual harassment”: see e.g., <em>Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> (“<b><em>Yue Tock Lim</em></b>”) at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7        <em>Second</em>, the applicant must prove that a PPO/DEO “is necessary”. One way of assessing whether this requirement has been proved is to ask the following question – <em>Is family violence likely to occur in future against the person(s) sought to be protected?</em> If the answer is “no”, a PPO/DEO will not be appropriate even if family violence has been committed. An example where a PPO was denied for this reason is <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [13] to [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I now return to the Wife’s and Husband’s applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the end of a trial –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found that the Wife and Husband were likely to continually harass each other, and that it was necessary to issue a protection order.

Accordingly, I declined to make any such order against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I will now explain my decision. For a start, I wish to state that during the trial, the parties had made many accusations of family violence against each other.

Both parties relied on this incident to support their respective application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The 1 May incident was recorded on video.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This video revealed that for about 20 mins, <em>each party</em> had knowingly harassed each other. In the video –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband and Wife could clearly be seen recording each other during their altercation – while concurrently and repeatedly accusing each other of provocation. This is a highly provocative conduct: <em>VWT v VWS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26733-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 111</a> at [36].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife could be observed raising her voice and repeatedly confronting the Husband – even when the latter walked away from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband could be seen entering and remaining in the Wife’s and Daughter’s shared bedroom – despite being repeatedly told that he was invading their privacy and that he was to leave the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband could be seen repeatedly telling the Wife that she was prohibited from entering his bedroom and using its ensuite toilet – despite the latter being upset by this prohibition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband could also be seen telling the Wife that she was a mere occupier in the Flat and that she had no right to stay there legally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The 1 May incident is not an isolated incident of harassment between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It is not disputed that there is <em>deep and long-standing animosity</em> between them. During their marriage, the parties have filed numerous police reports accusing each other of having committed family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Back in 2013, the Wife filed a police report accusing the Husband of hitting her head. In 2018, she accused him of hitting her clavicle. In 2019, the Wife applied for a PPO against the Husband. (This application was subsequently withdrawn.) The evidence showed that the Wife had no qualms in summoning the Police to intervene in her altercations with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between December 2023 to early October 2024 (11 months), the Husband filed 31 police reports against the Wife for abusive, threatening, and harassing conduct committed against him. The Police had classified the incidents in four of these reports under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I pause to make a few observations regarding the evidential value of police reports in PPO/DEO proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The filing of a police report and the offence classification of the report by the Police do not prove that the act alleged in the report has been committed. This is because a police report is a self-interested statement, and its contents have not been tested in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The filing of a police report <em>per se</em> does not constitute harassment of the person complained against in the report: <em>Yue Tock Lim</em> at [80] to [83]; <em>GFS</em> at [61]. A contrary view can have the undesirable effect of deterring a person from genuinely reporting a wrongdoing or seeking police assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     However, where <em>both</em> parties <em>repeatedly</em> file police reports against each other, then one cannot exclude the possibility that they could have done so to improperly cause the other party to be investigated (and thus be harassed) in a game of tit-for-tat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s request to admit further evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the trial, the parties wanted to refer to some of the allegations of family violence in [14] above. In fact, the Wife had requested to admit <em>further</em> evidence – in the form of three videos – to support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I disallowed the Wife’s request. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a starting point, the evidence in a PPO trial should be confined to those that support or rebut the allegations of family violence contained in an applicant’s complaint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there are good reasons to depart from the starting position, then notice to admit the further evidence must be given as soon as possible. It is important that the other party (i) is not taken by surprise and (ii) has sufficient opportunity to respond to the further evidence: <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> (“<b><em>Lai Kwok Kin</em></b>”) at [57] – [60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In this case, the Wife’s request to admit the further evidence was belated. It was made (i) more than three months after the matter was fixed for trial, (ii) during the second tranche of the hearing, and (iii) while the Husband was being cross-examined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There is no evidence that the Wife had given advance notice of her request to admit further evidence to the Husband. To admit the further evidence in such circumstances is highly prejudicial to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Furthermore, the Husband shared that he had refrained from admitting further video evidence <em>of his own</em> to rebut the Wife’s case (when she testified at the first tranche of hearing about six weeks earlier) and to support his case. This was because he did not want to prolong the trial. However, if the Wife was permitted to admit the three videos, then he should also be allowed to admit his video evidence. In my view, the admission of further evidence by both parties in such haphazard circumstances is not desirable. If discipline is not imposed in the admission of further evidence, then a PPO trial can descend into chaos and end up being protracted. This is not in anyone’s interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, my decision to disallow the admission of further evidence did not prejudice the Wife. This is because I had eventually acceded to her request for a PPO and DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether there is a need to assess each allegation of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I take this opportunity to address a related issue – i.e., in cases where parties in cross-applications for PPO allege that the other party has committed multiple acts of family violence, must a court assess the credibility of <em>each</em> allegation in determining whether the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement for PPO is proved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the answer is no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On a plain reading, all that s 65(1) needs to be proved (for the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement) is that “family violence has been committed <em>or is likely to be committed</em> against a family member”. [emphasis added] In other words, the 1<sup>st</sup> requirement can be met if an applicant can prove that family violence “is likely to be committed” – there is no need for him/her to prove that such violence has in fact been committed prior to the PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from s 65(1), there are also good reasons why, in principle, a court should not be obliged to make findings as to whether family violence has been committed for every allegation raised by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The purpose of a PPO is <em>not to punish</em> a party for past acts of such violence: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him</em> at [10]; <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“<b><em>GFS</em></b>”) at [31]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]; <em>UMI v UMK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [37] to [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Instead, a PPO is “<em>pre-emptive</em>” in purpose – i.e., it protects an applicant from <em>future</em> family violence. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is in danger of family violence, then a PPO should be issued even if such violence has not been committed on the applicant previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, in the case of cross-complaints involving parties in a highly acrimonious relationship, there is a real risk of the parties expecting the court to adjudicate on who was “right” or “wrong” regarding their past differences. A PPO trial is not a forum to settle personal scores. There is little utility in expending court resources to scrutinise each allegation of family violence when it is already clear from the evidence or from a party’s conduct in court that he/she is ready to engage in escalatory “tit-for-tat” for the most minor slight perceived from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum up – in view of [12] to [14] above, I am satisfied that the Husband and Wife are likely to cause continual harassment knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> requirement – Protection orders are necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I now come to the 2<sup>nd</sup> requirement. In my view, a PPO/DEO is “necessary” in the present case. My reasons are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Once it is proved that family violence “is likely to be committed”, then it must logically follow that a PPO is necessary to protect an applicant from such violence. In other words, a PPO is <em>presumptively</em> necessary: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     To displace this presumption, a respondent will have the <em>burden</em> of adducing evidence to prove that a PPO is in fact not necessary to protect the applicant. If the respondent fails to discharge this evidential burden, then a PPO ought to be issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the present case, the parties have failed to displace the presumption that a PPO/DEO is necessary. In fact, the evidence shows otherwise:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       As stated earlier, there is a deep and long-standing animosity between the parties. They are still living together and the Wife is unemployed. This means that the risk of friction between them is very real.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Just one month after the Wife commenced divorce proceedings in April 2024, both parties promptly applied for PPO/DEO against each other. <em>After</em> these applications were filed, the Husband had made 10 police reports against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Each party have resorted to recording the other party’s conduct during their arguments. Such acts can escalate the tension between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Husband’s conduct in [12(e)] above suggests that he believed that he was entitled to evict the Wife – despite the Flat being their matrimonial home. A DEO is necessary to make it clear that the Husband is not to either (1) intrude into the privacy of the bedroom of his estranged Wife or (2) evict her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To summarise – I have found that the Wife and Husband are likely to continually harass each other, and that a PPO/DEO is necessary for their protection. Accordingly, I allowed (a) the Husband’s application and (b) the Wife’s application (to protect herself).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">PPO application for the Daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Requirements not met</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to the Wife’s application for a PPO to protect the Daughter from the Husband. I have declined to make the order. This is because in general, the Wife’s accusations that the Husband had committed family violence against the Daughter (a) are sweeping in nature, (b) lack particulars (such as time and place of the alleged violence), (c) do not fit the definition of “family violence”, and (d) are not borne out by the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Let me give an example. During the trial, the Wife alleged that the Husband had “scolded” the Daughter during the 1 May incident. According to her, this scolding is recorded in the video. The Wife’s claim is contradicted by the video.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It showed that at all material times during the 1 May incident, the Husband did not scold or behave in a threatening manner to the Daughter. On the contrary, whenever he spoke to her, the Husband was gentle – at times calling her “princess”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s request for the Daughter to testify</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     During the trial, the Wife requested that the Daughter be allowed to testify that she had felt threatened by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I rejected this request. My reasons are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In the video relating to the 1 May incident, the Daughter did not appear to be fearful of the Husband. In fact, she was outspoken and can clearly be seen to be confronting him regarding his decisions that she disagreed with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had tendered two handwritten notes from the Daughter dated 13 and 14 June 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It is also evident from these notes that the Daughter was not fearful of the Husband. In fact, she had levelled several accusations against him, including of him lying and “defaming” the Wife and her. The Daughter even threatened to call the Police if the Husband were to allege that the Wife had instigated her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Based on the tone and contents of her notes, it is not clear to me that the Daughter can be an objective witness. She seems to be siding with the Wife and parroting language that had been used by the latter. (See e.g., the Wife’s statement dated 27 August 2024 where the Wife accused of the Husband of “defaming” her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>) It is not disputed that the Daughter occupied the same bedroom with the Wife at all material times. In the circumstances, I cannot discount the possibility that the Wife might have alienated the Daughter against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, and in any event, I am of the view that it would not be in the Daughter’s interests to testify. Because of the acrimonious situation at home, she was already seeing a school counsellor. The Daughter should not be placed in a situation where she needs to – as a witness – take sides between her parents at the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The above are the reasons for my decision in the Wife’s and Husband’s applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Before concluding, I wish to convey the following <em>directly to the parties</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     You should not see the PPO/DEO made against each of you as “punishment” for your past conduct or as a judgement of your character. You should also not view the making of these orders as a sign that you have either “won” or “lost”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You live in a combined house consisting of two HDB units. You have ample living space. Keep out of each other’s way. Stop turning the home into a battleground for your contest of wills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It is an offence to contravene the orders that I have made.

As parties are siblings, I refer to the complainant as the “Brother” and the respondent as the “Sister”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties came before me with cross applications. The Brother’s chief complaint was that the Sister repeatedly went into his bedroom to clean it. He felt that his privacy was intruded and it had caused him stress such that he was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) a few times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Sister, in her defence, explained that she merely wanted to clean the room as her siblings did not clean their rooms.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Sister’s application related to an incident when tensions erupted over the aforesaid issue and the Brother assaulted her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties appeared in person. They were guided through the trial process. Parties were afforded the opportunity to cross-examine each other and make closing submissions. The Sister was in particular afforded multiple opportunities to cross-examine the Brother as she had attempted to state her case in detail instead of putting questions to the Brother during her cross-examination of the Brother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I granted the Sister’s application for a PPO against the Brother as it was not disputed that the Brother had physically assaulted her. The Brother did not appeal against my decision. I also granted the Brother’s application for the reasons stated below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The applicable law is clearly set out in the decision of the High Court (Family Division) in <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> and I reproduce the relevant parts in the next few paragraphs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Court is empowered to make a protection order under s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Protection order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.</b>—(1)    The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are thus two threshold requirements that must be met before a court may grant a PPO:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the court must be satisfied that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Family violence is defined in s 64 of the Charter as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member</em>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The civil standard of proof that is applied in determining whether PPOs ought to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The sole issue is whether the Sister’s acts in repeatedly entering the Brother’s room to clean it amounted to “continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to [the Brother]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I accept that ordinarily, a sibling cleaning another sibling’s room would be harmless (and indeed a loving act) and most certainly not amount to harassment. However, each case turns on its own facts. What may be harmless under one set of circumstances might be highly distressing in other circumstances. It is important not to make quick judgments without analysing the facts holistically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A pertinent point to note is that, according to the Brother, the Sister would enter his room sometime between 10pm or 11pm until 4am.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This was corroborated by a witness, who is the parties’ sister (“the Witness”), who shared a bedroom<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> with the Brother:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yah, because she---she choose the wrong timing to clean the room.

The Brother indeed stated that he had been admitted to IMH due to stress (see [2] above). Thus, I accepted that the Sister’s conduct had caused him anguish. Indeed, I note that the tensions erupted one day such that the Brother assaulted the Sister. While this was unacceptable (and was the reason why I granted the PPO for the Sister), it provided further support for the finding that the Sister’s conduct had caused the Brother deep distress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The next question is whether the Sister intended to or at least knew that her conduct would cause the Brother anguish. The evidence showed clearly Sister was aware that the Brother did not want her in his room. The Sister confirmed that the Brother had told her the same “numerous” times, which also confirmed that there were many instances of her entering the Brother’s room despite his protests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Witness also confirmed that the Sister would not take “no” for an answer, and when she (<em>ie</em>, the Witness) tried to lock the bedroom door (as stated at [12], the Witness shared a room with the Brother), the Sister would attempt to enter their room through other means.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In light of the evidence of both the Brother and the Witness, I was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Sister knew that her conduct in entering the Brother’s bedroom against his will would cause him anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I did not accept the Sister’s case which was essentially that she had to clean the room for the sake of hygiene. For example, she said:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">No, if the person does housework themselves, clean up their own room themselves, it’s fine. But they don’t even do so at all after 40 years of age. Not even one finger, not---don’t even lift, they---the whole window frame can be black colour. Okay. Because it’s very windy and we---we are on a low floor, and low floor unit, bad thing about that is there’s a lot of pests. They---they can even let a lizards go into the cupboard and stay inside there and---and breed and let cockroach, um, lay eggs all these things. And then---and then the cupboard mood---turned mouldy with yellow dots itself. So, when things is spoil, who is the one who repair? I am the one who repair and pay for everything. Huh? They don’t even pay a cent, they don’t even they---bother. When light is spoil, I repair. Everything I do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     However, there was no evidence to show that the Brother’s room was in such a squalid state that it had to be cleaned frequently against his will. There was also no evidence of pests in the Brother’s room or the house. To be clear, the photographs tendered by the Sister only showed at most a messy house;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> certainly not a house in such a state that she had to clean the Brother’s room in the wee hours of the night against his will. In any event, both parties are adults and it was not necessary for the Sister to impose her own hygiene standards on her Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To sum up, this was a case where the Sister entered the Brother’s room numerous times despite him making it clear many times that this intruded his privacy. The Sister would do so in the wee hours of the night, disrupting his rest. The Brother was so stressed that he was admitted to IMH (see [2] above). All these while, the Sister was aware that the Brother did not like her in his room. I was therefore satisfied that the Sister’s conduct amounted to continual harassment knowing that it was likely to cause anguish to the Brother. I was hence satisfied that the Sister had committed family violence against the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn to the question of whether it was necessary to grant the orders sought. It was clear from the evidence that the Sister had no insight into the impact of her conduct on her Brother. When queried whether she was willing to stop going into the Brother’s room given his discomfort, she replied:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">No, because---because he---because this unit belongs to my dad, not him. If he’s not comfortable, he can stay out. You ask him to stay out or get his own place. Because literally, he don’t upkeep his room and he’ll breed all the pest. Uh, because 2nd floor got a lot of pest. Whatever pest you name it, we got it. My mum’s ha---my mum’s room even got a cluster cockroach staying, yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As a result of the lack of insight and her clear insistence that she would continue entering the Brother’s room despite knowing the Brother’s distress, I found it necessary to grant both a PPO and a partial DEO (covering the Brother’s bedroom) for the Brother’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the above reasons, I allowed the Brother’s application for both a PPO and a partial DEO.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Brother’s Complaint Form;

The Defendant alleged that I had demonstrated bias by refusing his request to adjourn the contested divorce hearing of 9 September 2024 despite his medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The recusal summons was fixed before me together with an adjourned session of the contested divorce proceedings on 30 September 2024. The Plaintiff Wife had earlier indicated on 26 September 2024 that she would not be filing an affidavit in response to the recusal application. While the Defendant requested at the hearing on 30 September 2024 to be granted leave to file an additional affidavit, I did not think this to be necessary. The basis for his application was sufficiently laid out in his supporting affidavit, and there was no need for a rebuttal as the Plaintiff had chosen not to respond substantively. I therefore proceeded to hear the recusal application and dismissed it, with brief grounds provided later that day. The Defendant has appealed against the recusal application, and my full grounds are provided as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Defendant’s Case for Recusal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is trite that to succeed in a recusal application, the applicant must either show actual bias on the part of the judge, or apparent bias, i.e. that a fair-minded observer with reasonable knowledge of the facts would conclude that the judge was so biased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There is no evidence raised in the defendant’s affidavit in support of any actual bias on my part with regard to the Defendant. I therefore take it that the applicant’s case is based solely on apparent bias. The thrust of his complaint is that I had ordered him to attend the contested divorce hearing over Zoom on 9 September 2024 despite the existence of a medical certificate from his cardiologist, one Dr Lim Choon Pin, which recommended that he be exempted from attendance at court. The Defendant also complains that I had proceeded with the hearing until the arrival of paramedics (whom the Defendant had pre-arranged to fetch himself to hospital) heralded the end of the session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Threshold for Apparent Bias</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The law on recusal for apparent bias is set out in the case of <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0085.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85</a>, and was elucidated by Aidan Xu @ Aedit Abdullah J in <em>TOW v TOV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19792-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 16</a> at [31]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The test is whether the circumstances complained of would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the judge is biased. The assessment is made on an objective basis, but with the actual knowledge of the relevant facts. The fact that the yardstick is the perception of a fair-minded and reasonable person excludes any particular sensitivity or brittleness as to how the judge’s actions or statements should be judged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The threshold is not passed simply because a judge has made adverse findings or ruled against the interest of the applicant. The learned Judge further observed in <em>TOW v TOV</em>, at [34] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A judge in our adversarial system would be expected to sift through the evidence, choose one side’s version of the facts to the other’s, and normally, in the absence of objective evidence, reach conclusions on credit and credibility. If the judge considers that witnesses have been mistaken, deficient, or untruthful, the judge should make the necessary findings. The judge is not expected to be gingerly or tactful to the point of obscuring necessary findings. The courtroom is certainly not an arena for trial by combat, or for the flagellation of witnesses, but there is no safe zone against adverse findings in the courtroom: the court is concerned with the proof of a case, and will need to evaluate the credit and credibility of the witnesses who testify.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At [42], the court went on to observe that the mere fact that a judge had previously made adverse comments or findings against a litigant is not, on its own, sufficient for a recusal application to succeed. It should also be noted that even if the judge were wrong in his reasons or conclusion, that should not itself be reason to allege prejudice on his or her part (per <em>Werner Samuel Vuillemin v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21684-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHC 92</a> at [67]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Apparent Bias was Established on the Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The litmus test in the present appeal is whether the decision would lead an objective and omniscient onlooker to conclude that the judge was biased in the conduct of the matter. If so, this court should recuse itself of its own accord.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       To address the perception of my refusal to adjourn the contested divorce hearing, one needs to have regard to the long-drawn chronology of this matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjournments granted prior to the contested divorce hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Plaintiff’s writ of divorce was filed more than two years ago, on 4 August 2022. After the Defendant entered appearance on 20 October 2022, mediation and counselling was conducted from December 2022 to January 2023, but did not prove successful. Directions were then given for the case to proceed to a contested divorce hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Defendant next filed FC/SUM 734/2023 on 7 March 2023 to strike out the Plaintiff’s reference to a mutual agreement in the divorce proceedings. The summons was heard on 12 June 2023 and dismissed in part. The Defendant appealed against this decision in FC/RA 11/2023, which was heard by the District Judge in chambers and dismissed on 1 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant then filed a further appeal against the dismissal of his striking out application on 4 August 2023, in FC/RAS 14/2023. The appeal hearing was initially fixed for hearing before the High Court Family Division on 20 September 2023, but this was eventually adjourned six times over a period of about ten months to 18 July 2024 on account of the Defendant’s heart condition. The full details of these adjournments are provided to give a flavour of the latitude granted to the Defendant for his medical condition for the interlocutory appeal.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"15.3430686137227%\"><col width=\"16.3432686537307%\"><col width=\"16.9833966793359%\"><col width=\"21.1842368473695%\"><col width=\"30.1460292058412%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Case / Type of Hearing</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date of Hearing</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Correspondence</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Whether Medical Certificate (“MC”) tendered</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reason for adjournment</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">RAS 14/2023 (Hearing)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">20 September 2023</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">17 September 2023</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">MC dated 17 September 2023 exempting Defendant from court hearing from 16 to 20 September 2023.

This was nearly a year after it had been filed on 4 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjournments granted in the course of the contested divorce hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The matter first came before me for hearing of the contested divorce on 13 August 2024. It would eventually be adjourned six times over the course of the next ten weeks to accommodate the Defendant’s medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The First Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the first hearing date of 13 August 2024, the Defendant was absent from court. It transpired that he had sent an e-mail to the Registry fifteen minutes prior to the hearing, informing that he had just undergone an angioplasty procedure that day. The e-mail attached Dr Lim Choon Pin’s memo, which requested the court to adjourn his case for three months until after 30 November 2024. No explanation was given why advance notice was not provided for the Defendant’s absence, given that the hearing date had been fixed since 17 July 2024. The memo also did not comply with the Family Justice Court’s Practice Directions (“the Practice Directions”), as it did not state specifically <em>whether and when</em> the Defendant was unfit to attend court. The court accordingly directed that the matter be adjourned to 27 August 2024, and that the Defendant resubmit a medical certificate which excused his attendance for that day as well as any further date, accompanied by a full medical report explaining his medical history in relation to his heart problems. The Defendant was also instructed to ensure that his medical certificate be in compliance with paragraph 162(3) of the Practice Directions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Second Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Defendant next wrote in with a medical report from Dr Lim Choon Pin dated 17 August 2024. The doctor observed that the Defendant had had some bruising and swelling at the right groin access site for his recent angioplasty procedure, and was still being monitored to see if his chest pain symptoms had resolved. The doctor recommended that the Defendant was medically unfit to attend court for the period from 13 August 2024 to 30 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, the court converted the hearing from an open court hearing to a hearing over Zoom, and adjourned the hearing (for a second time) from 27 August 2024 to 9 September 2024. The registry’s reply via email on 26 August 2024 emphasised to the Defendant that the change of mode of hearing was in deference to his medical condition, noting as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Should you feel concerned about your medical condition, you may locate yourself either in a hospital or in a place where you can be readily assisted should any medical emergency arise. You may wish to consult with your medical doctor on how best to make arrangements for such attendance. As family proceedings are confidential, you are reminded to ensure that you attend the Zoom hearing in a private room, although you are at liberty to call on assistance in the event of any medical need or emergency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In a further response on 5 September 2024 to the Defendant’s repeated requests to further adjourn the divorce hearing, the Defendant was also offered the option of attending the Zoom proceedings from a room in court, so that ready assistance could be provided in the event of any medical emergency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Third Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The adjourned hearing was next held on 9 September 2024, with the Defendant choosing to attend the proceedings over Zoom from his residence. He repeated his request for an adjournment, which was denied on the basis that he could call for medical assistance if needed. Over the course of the hearing, the Defendant revealed that he had made a prior arrangement for an ambulance to pick him up from his residence at 10.30 am on the day of the hearing. He admitted that this had been arranged some four to five days prior to the 9 September hearing (i.e. on 4 or 5 September). He also revealed that the ambulance service had contacted him on the night of 8 September and that he had confirmed the appointment. When the paramedics eventually arrived at 11 am during the morning hearing, the court had little choice but to adjourn the hearing (for the third time) to 18 September 2024, 2:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Fourth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Defendant next wrote in on 10 September 2024 with a medical certificate indicating that he was unfit to attend court from 9 to 22 September 2024. As a result, the hearing was adjourned (for the fourth time) to 26 September 2024, at 2:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Fifth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the morning of 26 September 2024, the Defendant wrote in at 10:23 am claiming that he had suffered a heart attack in the morning and was currently warded in Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. The hearing was adjourned (for the fifth time) to 30 September 2024, with fresh directions given to tender a medical report and medical certificate in compliance with Practice Directions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Defendant next submitted a clinical discharge summary, a medical report and medical certificate on 27 September 2024. The clinical discharge revealed that he was admitted and warded at the Mount Elizabeth Novena hospital from 26 to 27 September 2024 for chest pain, right groin pseudoaneurysm and right subconjunctival haemorrhage. No mention was made of him having suffered a heart attack as had been claimed. He was discharged with a medical certificate granting hospitalisation leave and which stated he was not fit for court attendance, for a period of 18 days from 26 September to 13 October 2024. As directed by the court, Dr Lim Choon Pin submitted a medical report dated 27 September 2026 which re-iterated his earlier recommendation that the Defendant was medically unfit to attend court until 30 November 2024 (when his prescription of double blood thinners ends). It is not clear if there was actually a consult conducted by Dr Lim with the Defendant in the course of the latter’s recent admission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Sixth Adjournment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The hearing next proceeded on 30 September 2024, with the Defendant attending under protest. The recusal summons was mentioned first, with the Defendant seeking leave to file a further affidavit in support of his application. This was declined as the Plaintiff had earlier indicated on the hearing of 26 September 2024 that she was not filing an affidavit. An opportunity was given for the Defendant to orally submit on the recusal application, which he declined to do on the basis that his doctor had advised him that he could not be involved in any argument or hearing. I noted that the Defendant had clearly stated his position in his supporting affidavit, and being satisfied that he had sufficiently put forward his case, proceeded to hear and dismiss the recusal summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The court did not proceed thereafter with the contested divorce hearing. Instead, special directions were given on account of the Defendant’s medical condition. Each party was directed to file a list of questions via correspondence by 7 October 2024, with leave to file a final reply affidavit solely restricted to answering the questions posed by 18 October 2024. It was also directed that if no questions were tendered, the court would take it that the party had no questions to be raised in cross-examination. Mindful that the Defendant’s latest medical certificate (dated 27 September 2024) recommended absence from court until 13 October 2024, the hearing of the matter was adjourned to 22 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether a reasonable person would have a reasonable suspicion of bias</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As can be seen from the above, the Defendant was given ample latitude since September 2023 due to his medical issues, with six adjournments given over the course of his interlocutory appeal, and another six adjournments over the course of the present contested divorce hearings (two of which were <em>prior</em> to the 9 September 2024 hearing which is the subject matter of the recusal). It is noteworthy that despite being given respite since September 2023 to July 2024 from court proceedings, the Defendant had chosen to put off his angioplasty procedure throughout this period, even though his own doctor had recommended that he undergo this procedure. This was evident from Dr Lim Choon Pin’s medical report dated 8 April 2024, which provided the following assessment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I first saw [Defendant] on 13 October 2023 in my outpatient cardiac clinic. He reported symptoms of chest tightness and had undergone a CT coronary angiogram at Starmed under Dr Peter Ting that had showed significant blockage in one of his heart arteries (left anterior descending artery). He came to see me for further management of his cardiac condition. He subsequently underwent a coronary angiogram on 17 October 2023 which showed that he indeed has significant coronary artery stenosis in the mid to distal left anterior descending artery and fractional flow reserve was impaired (0.73) with adenosine challenge. <b>He was recommended to undergo angioplasty and stenting of this artery, but chose medical therapy instead.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Currently, [Defendant] has decided to postpone his decision for angioplasty and stenting of his narrowed heart artery.</b> He wants to pursue medical therapy, but still complains of chest tightness when he gets angry, hence my recommendation that he be excused from court proceedings until end of May 2024 when I review him again for the effectiveness of his treatment. If his chest pain is better controlled, he can resume attending court. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Defendant then curiously fixed the angioplasty procedure on the first date of the hearing of the contested divorce hearing on 13 August 2024, with only 15 minutes’ prior notice given to the court. It also bears mention that he had arranged in advance for an ambulance some four to five days before the next proceeded hearing date of 9 September 2024, even before he faced any actual emergency on that day. The recording of the proceedings conducted over Zoom will also show that despite the Defendant’s repeated insistence that he was unable to conduct the proceedings, he appeared calm and was able to advance his case, at least until the pre-arranged arrival of paramedics compelled an adjournment of the session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Despite the multiple delays occasioned by the Defendant’s medical condition in the interlocutory appeal, this court had adjourned the present hearing six times over a period of ten weeks from 13 August to 22 October 2024. It had also given the Defendant the leeway to attend the hearing on Zoom from a hospital, clinic or any location where he could be assured of medical assistance if needed. These special arrangements were granted because there was a clear and pressing need to move the proceedings forward in this case, given that more than two years had passed since the filing of the divorce writ. It is apposite to remember that justice delayed is also justice denied. This is underscored by the judge-led approach under Rule 22(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014, which exhorts the court to “make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economic disposal of the cause or matter.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It should also be remembered that the pith of the recusal application is not the correctness of the directions given by the court. It is whether, from an objective viewpoint, such directions reveal bias or prejudice on the part of the court such that it should remove itself from further conduct of the proceedings. Given the extensive delay occasioned in this case, I did not find the directions made to be unreasonable in the mind of an objective bystander. Quite to the contrary, every latitude had been extended to the Defendant to manage his medical conditions and to proceed with reasonable despatch with the present proceedings. It should be remembered that the court is not bound to abdicate its management of court proceedings at the behest of medical practitioners, no matter how well intentioned. The court remains the master of its own procedure, and is solely responsible for balancing the needs of justice with the demands of efficiency. In the present case, every reasonable accommodation has been made in view of the Defendant’s medical issues, including multiple adjournments and a shift in the modality of hearing, first to a remote hearing, and finally to an exchange of questions and answers by way of affidavit. There is no indication that the Defendant is unable to pen thoughts to paper to further his case, and these special directions have been given to move proceedings along in a manner that minimises any risk posed to the Defendant’s health. It bears noting too that considerable prejudice has already been suffered by the Plaintiff, who has waited two years for the divorce proceedings to move forward. Under the circumstances, I do not think that the directions given in the conduct of this case would give rise to an impression in the mind of an objective bystander that the court had been biased against the Defendant in the conduct of these proceedings. Quite to the contrary, a court which adjourns <em>ad infinitum</em> on medical grounds may be perceived as being unjust to the other party stranded in adjudicative limbo through no fault of their own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I accordingly dismissed the application for recusal, as well as the attendant prayer that the divorce proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of the recusal summons, since this was no longer necessary. As the Plaintiff did not ask for costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Custody – Care and control – Husband and wife each seeking sole care and control of their four children – Applicable considerations","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Dual income marriage lasting 21½ years – Reduction of husband’s indirect contributions on account of having intentionally and knowingly harmed the children’s interest","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife – Wife seeking nominal maintenance – Applicable principles","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Wife seeking recovery of maintenance arrears"],"date":"2024-10-14","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1133 of 2023 (Ancillary Matters)","title":"XDZ v XEA","citation":"[2024] SGFC 90","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32327-SSP.xml","counsel":["U Sethuraj Naidu (M/s Godwin Campos LLC) for the Husband","Tan Siew Kim, Loo Liang Zhi & Prasanth Ganesan (M/s Sterling Law Corporation) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2024-10-20T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XDZ v XEA</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XDZ <em>v</em> XEA </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

They were married in June 2002 and have four children. After 21½ years of marriage, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in March 2023. The divorce was uncontested and interim judgement was granted in November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The matter came before me for a decision on ancillary matters. My decision on these matters is summarised as follows (for the details of my orders, see <b><u>Annex B</u></b>):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Both parties shall have <b>joint custody</b> of their four children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall have <b>sole care and control of the children</b> – with reasonable access being granted to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The <b>matrimonial assets</b> shall be divided in the proportion of <b>30% (to the Husband)</b> and <b>70% (to the Wife)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To implement this division –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband shall be entitled to <b>$192,696.80</b> in the Wife’s CPF accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband shall transfer his rights, title and interests in the matrimonial home to the Wife upon the transfer of the monies above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)       Aside from the matrimonial home, each party shall retain their assets in their sole names. There shall be no further claims against Parties and/or their assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband shall pay to the Wife <b>$700/month for each child’s maintenance</b>. (Total child maintenance for four children: $2,800.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children – Custody, care and control, and access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the ancillary matters relating to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The four children are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>1<sup>st</sup> Child</b> – Female, 15 years (D.O.B. xx January 2009).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Child</b> – Female, 13 years (D.O.B. xx November 2010).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>3<sup>rd</sup> Child</b> – Male, 7 years (D.O.B. xx March 2017).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>4<sup>th</sup> Child</b> – Male, 7 years (D.O.B. xx March 2017).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In this judgement, the children will be referred to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The 1<sup>st</sup> Child and 2<sup>nd</sup> Child – collectively as the “<b>Daughters</b>”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The 3<sup>rd</sup> Child and 4<sup>th</sup> Child – collectively as the “<b>Twins</b>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Interim child orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At this juncture, it is important to note that on 4 March 2023, the Husband had removed the Daughters from the matrimonial home and made them stay with him at his parents’ flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As a result of the Husband’s actions, the Wife took out an application to seek, among others, the Daughters’ return to the matrimonial home. Following mediation, a consent order was entered in February 2024. It provided, among others, that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties were to have interim joint custody of all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was to have interim care and control of the Daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife was to have interim care and control of the Twins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Each party was to have access to the children not under their interim care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the hearing before me, it was agreed that the parties should continue to have joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Each party however wished to have sole care and control of all the children. It was agreed that the children should not be split between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Given the parties’ position, each of them would have to prove that he/she was a <em>more suitable parent</em> to take care of all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     To discharge such a burden, a parent should generally avoid a character assassination of the other parent. This is because such conduct creates needless acrimony without necessarily proving that one parent is a better caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Instead, a parent should show why <em>he/she</em> can better act in the child’s best interests. (This mirrors the approach for assessing the extent of a party’s indirect contributions to the marriage – i.e., to focus on the strengths of one’s case rather than to highlight the weaknesses of the other party’s case: <em>ARY v ARX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> (“<b><em>ARY</em></b>”) at [59].) In line with this approach, the parent should focus on proving why <em>he/she</em> can better <em>–</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Attend to the child’s emotional, developmental, and material needs,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Provide for the child’s daily care, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Make day-to-day decisions for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>See, e.g., <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> (“<b><em>TSF</em></b>”) at [67] – [69]; <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [72].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Relevant considerations</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14      <b><em>Considerations relating to the applicant-parent</em></b>. In line with [13] above, it will be helpful for a parent to specifically address the following when seeking to be a child’s sole caregiver:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Past and present interactions with the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Demonstrate, with concrete examples that are supported by contemporaneous evidence (and not just generic statements), how the parent has been showing concern, interest and responsibility for the child. See <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a> (“<b><em>ABW</em></b>”) at [23(b)]; <em>Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1987] SLR(R) 0725.xml')\">[1987] SLR(R) 725</a> (“<b><em>Tan Siew Kee</em></b>”) at [16] (where a father, who had taken the initiative to seek his son’s custody after removing him from the mother, was found to be more concerned for the child’s interests than the mother who took no step to resume custody of the child).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Identify which parent has been the child’s primary caregiver, especially when the child was young: <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29392-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 5 SLR 301</a> at [18]. If a parent claims to be the primary caregiver, he/she should produce concrete examples of, among others, (i) his/her involvement in significant events in the child’s life and (ii) occasions when he/she had made sacrifices to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The extent of the parent’s bond with the child: <em>UFZ v UFY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a> at [22]; <em>AAV v AAW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0488.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 488</a> (“<b><em>AAV</em></b>”) at [24] and [26]. Where <em>both</em> parents hold full-time jobs, then the fact that the child is closer to one of them can be a relevant consideration. The element of the maternal bond can be significant –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the child is very young: <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a> at [43] – [45] (the child was four years old); <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> (“<b><em>Wong Phila Mae</em></b>”) at [22(c)] and [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where all the other considerations are finely balanced: <em>Re W (A Minor) (Custody)</em> (1983) 4 FLR 492, cited with approval in <em>Chan Kah Cheong Kenneth v Teoh Kheng Yau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 2 SLR(R) 0595.xml')\">[1994] 2 SLR(R) 595</a> at [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The child’s wishes. This is relevant if the child is of an age to express an independent opinion: s 125(2)(b) of the Charter; <em>WKM v WKN</em> [2024] 1 SLR 15 (“<b><em>WKN</em></b>”) at [60] and [61]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(b)]; <em>ABW</em> at [23(d)]; <em>ZO v ZP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0647.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 647</a> at [15] and [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Future caregiving arrangements</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Demonstrate, with concrete examples, why the parent can provide better care if he/she is given sole care and control of the child. Examples of this can include the parent’s plans for the child’s care arrangements. It bears highlighting that a parent’s ability to provide for the child <em>financially</em> is a relevant – but not conclusive – consideration: <em>Re C (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0502.xml')\">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 502</a> (“<b><em>Re C</em></b>”) at [18]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [23]. The parent’s ability to care for the child is especially significant, for instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the child has special needs: <em>TSF</em> at [68] (where a father, who had in place an effective system to address the needs of his autistic child, was found to be a better caregiver).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where the parent has a physical and cognitive condition. In such a case, the parent should clarify whether the condition will impede his/her ability to care for the child, and if so, how this can be mitigated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Where the parent is working full-time and will need to enlist others to help care for the child. Where <em>both</em> parents are working, it is preferrable that a parent arranges for caregivers who are familiar to the child rather than relies on strangers to be the caregivers: <em>TSF</em> at [67] and [69]; <em>Re C</em> at [16] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parent’s ability to provide a secure and stable home environment for the child: <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(d)]. The parent’s occupation can sometimes be relevant to this consideration. See <em>Re C</em> at [4] and [19], where a mother, whose occupation involved fortune-telling, performing religious rituals, and frequent travelling, was found to be a less suitable caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Whether the parent can ensure a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent: <em>WKM</em> at [82], [83] and [85]; <em>ABW</em> at [45]; <em>TSF</em> at [82].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <b><em>Considerations relating to the other parent</em></b>. After the parent has demonstrated why he/she is suitable to be the sole caregiver, the parent can then, if necessary, show why the other parent may be an unsuitable caregiver. Some of the relevant considerations have been highlighted in [14] above. Others include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Evidence that the other parent has an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook on matters which can affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child. Cases where a parent has been found to be a less suitable caregiver on this basis include the following: <em>Tan Siew Kee</em> at [13] to [15] (a mother who was a habitual mahjong gambler and had no time to look after her child); <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [25] (a father who caused his children to lose out a year’s education because of his unconventional and informal education method); <em>AZB v AYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a> at [40] to [44] (a father who had a proclivity for pornography and had left pornographic materials in areas accessible to his child, had used foul language in the child’s presence, and had spoilt the child by lavishing her with gifts); <em>AAV</em> at [24] to [26] and [29] to [31] (a father who had a materialistic outlook and had ongoing relationships with two women).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Evidence that the other parent had intentionally or knowingly acted against the child’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <b><em>General considerations</em></b>. Finally, depending on the facts, the following considerations can also relevant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being: <em>ABW</em> at [20] and [21]. Thus, an order that will result in the child having to be uprooted and to reside in a different environment will not be lightly made: <em>Re C</em> at [17(a)]; <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [26] and [27]; <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> (“<b><em>VZJ</em></b>”) at [9] and [10]; <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27401-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 598</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Siblings should generally not be separated: <em>Wong Phila Mae</em> at [22(e)]; <em>ABW</em> at [23(e)]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> at [24].

The potential adverse impact that this can have on them is just too difficult to predict and manage. It is unnecessary to take such a risk.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) As for the Twins, they are only about 7 years old.

id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For completeness, I did not accept the Wife’s submission to deduct from the pool of matrimonial assets her legal fees ($30,000) in connection with the ancillary matters hearing. I agreed with the Husband that such a deduction is unprincipled and is akin to ordering costs against him. As the High Court had observed in <em>AQT v AQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0138.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 138</a> at [37]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It was highly unusual for the legal fees for these very matrimonial proceedings to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. It would be an unwise precedent to allow parties to deduct their hefty legal costs from the pool of matrimonial assets. Whatever liability parties owe their solicitors for the matrimonial proceedings should be settled from their own share of the matrimonial assets after division. To deduct the legal fees from the joint pool of matrimonial assets during the proceedings would be to render any cost order the Court made in the judgment largely nugatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">“Just and equitable” way to divide the assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Based on [24] to [26] above, the total value of the matrimonial assets for division is <b>$1,795,054.03</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The next question is what is a “just and equitable” way to divide these assets: s 112(1) of the Charter?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In answering this question, I noted that the parties (a) had a long marriage lasting 21½ years and (b) had both been working at all material times. In the circumstances, the “structured approach” to the division of matrimonial assets in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> at [22] and [26] (“<b><em>ANJ</em></b>”) would be applicable. Under this approach, a court considers two types of contributions when dividing the assets, giving them equal weightage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Direct contributions.</em> This is the “amount of financial contributions each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets”. In the case of the matrimonial home, this will include downpayments, deposits, cash payments and monthly payments towards the acquisition of the home, as well as renovation costs that are substantial and add a lasting value to the property: <em>Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1276.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1276</a> (“<b><em>Sim Kim Heng</em></b>”) at [82].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Indirect contributions</em>. This is “each party’s indirect contributions to the well-being of the family”. The following considerations apply to this type of contributions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Indirect contributions can be monetary, e.g., moneys that a spouse spends on (1) re-painting, repair of electrical wiring, and fittings (such as furniture) for the home, (2) maintaining the home, and (3) household expenses and payment of a child’s school fees: <em>Sim Kim Heng</em> at [82]; <em>ANJ</em> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Indirect contributions can also be non-monetary, e.g., where a spouse (1) attends to the care of the child (<em>VZJ</em> at [57] to [59]), (2) devotes time to look after an aged or dependent in-law (<em>Sim Kim Heng</em> at [82]), (3) makes personal sacrifices to advance the other spouse’s career and endeavours (<em>ARY</em> at [61]; <em>TIT v TIU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> at [36] and [37]; <em>UAP v UAQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21471-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 319</a> (“<b><em>UAP</em></b>”) at [80]); (4) supports the other spouse in times of the latter’s personal crisis (<em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [43]; <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [21]), and (5) carries out maintenance, repairs and improvements to the household appliances: <em>ANJ</em> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       A spouse’s indirect contributions <em>can be reduced</em> if there is undisputed evidence that he/she has acted in an extreme (i.e. manifestly serious) manner that harms the well-being of the family. It bears highlighting that the reduction is not intended to punish a spouse. The threshold to reduce a spouse’s indirect contributions is a “<em>high one</em>”. All factors must be considered in a holistic manner, and a reduction will not be made where both sides are engaged in a mutually destructive exercise: <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17048-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 195</a> (“<b><em>Chan Tin Sun</em></b>”) at [25], [27] and [28]; <em>UAP</em> at [82]; <em>TQU v TQT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24198-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 8</a> at [131]. Courts have reduced a spouse’s indirect contributions where, e.g., he/she (1) had sought to poison the other spouse (<em>Chan Tin Sun</em> at [25], [27] and [55]), or (2) had engaged in marital affairs (<em>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17978-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 52</a>).</p> <p

This decision was upheld on appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Court of Appeal however noted that the wife had a <em>known</em> pre-existing medical condition of a slipped disc. The court decided to award nominal maintenance – to preserve the wife’s future right to obtain financial support from the husband should she become unable to work on account of that medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em><u>AVM v AWH </u></em> <u><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17941-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1274</a> at [96] to [98]</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In this case, the husband was unemployed and an undischarged bankrupt. The wife, on the other hand, was economically independent. Given the circumstances, the court decided not to order spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_g\"></a>(g)     However, the court granted the wife liberty to apply for maintenance if the circumstances changed. In my view, although the court did not award nominal maintenance, the effect of its decision (i.e., the grant of liberty to apply) is similar in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Applying the principles in [52] and [53] above, I found that it was inappropriate to award nominal maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Reason A</em>. There is no evidence that the Wife was at risk of losing her job. In any event, an award of nominal maintenance based on Reason 1 is akin to making the Husband insure against the risk of the Wife losing her job. This is not the purpose of such maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Reason B.</em> I had already decided to award the matrimonial home to the Wife. As such, Reason B is moot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Reason C</em>. Awarding nominal maintenance based on Reason C is unprincipled and unprecedented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In my view, the Wife would be able to take care of herself financially after the divorce. She had been gainfully employed throughout her marriage and had been earning a relatively good income. Prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings, the Wife’s income was comparable to the Husband’s. At the time of the ancillary matters hearing, her income was higher than the Husband’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance – For the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’

The following part of this judgement is addressed to them directly as parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Many events have taken place since 4 March 2023. During the past 18 months, family members – who used to be close – have grown apart. From the CER, it appears that even before 4 March 2023, there were already cracks in your relationship between you and your children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Moving forward, you should seriously reflect on the effect of your actions on your children’s wellbeing. It is obvious to me that each of you love your children dearly. It is however less clear to me, and perhaps even to you yourself, whether you have expressed that love and acted in your children’s interests in the best way possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the current state of the family as well as the orders that I have made, you cannot adopt a “business as usual” mindset in your parenting approach. You must look within themselves – and seek professional help if possible – to see how you can salvage your relationship with your children. Now is the time for course correction. For instance, <em>be less controlling</em> of your children – and <em>be more conscious and sensitive</em> of their feelings and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_d\"></a>(d)     While you may be anxious to focus your attention on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Child, please do not forget that you have three other children. Each of them needs your personal care and attention. As all parents and educators know – <em>each child is special</em>, and each parent-child relationship is dynamic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In the coming weeks and months, you will make new discoveries about your children – especially with those who have not been under your care for the past 18 months. Be <em>less comparing</em> between the children – and <em>more cherishing</em> of their individuality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_74-p2_f\"></a>(f)     One thing is clear. The next lap of your children’s life will be tough. <em>They will need all the emotional support that you can provide. They will also need both of you to work together to act in their best interests.</em> Now is your opportunity to make things right. Please be there for them.

Interim Judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was thus granted on 5 August 2021 where the orders relating to the ancillary matters (“AM Orders”) of divorce were made “<em>by consent</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Certificate of Final Judgment was granted on 9 November 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In June 2024, more than 2½ years later, the Defendant filed the present application, <em>ie.</em> FC/SUM 1758/2024 (“SUM 1758”) seeking to revoke or vary some of the AM Orders contained in the IJ. The Defendant claims that he was labouring under certain “mental disorders” at the time the IJ was granted and thus – according to his counsel – the IJ was obtained despite the Defendant’s “<em>mental incompetence and mental incapacity</em>”, or that the IJ should be set aside on the grounds of “<em>unconscionability</em>” because the Plaintiff had taken advantage of the Defendant’s situation at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For completeness, the Defendant seeks to set-aside Orders 3(c), 3(d)(a) – (f) of the IJ (“Disputed Orders”). In gist, these are the Orders relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets which the Defendant says do not reflect a “<em>just and equitable</em>” division of the parties’ assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant says these orders were not “<em>fair</em>” because they were made “<em>totally for the benefit of</em> [the Plaintiff]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To be clear, the Defendant does not seek to set aside the other orders in the IJ relating to: (i) custody, care and control, and access to their child, [K]; and (ii) the maintenance payable to the Plaintiff and [K].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Based on the parties’ written submissions and the counsel’s oral arguments, the issues before this Court are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Does the Family Court have the power to vary or revoke the IJ on account of a parties’ alleged mental “incompetence” or “incapacity, and/or on account of alleged “unconscionability” by one party?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Has the Defendant satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify revoking or varying the Disputed Orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I will discuss each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Basis For Revoking Or Varying Consent Orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I start by providing a brief overview of the applicable principles in relation to an application to revoke (or set-aside) orders dividing the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the WC (for ease of reference, I will refer to such orders as, “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) allows the Court to “<em>extend, vary, revoke or discharge</em>” at any time such division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     While s 112(4) appears, on first glance, to be broadly drafted, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> has made clear that this statutory provision does not give <em>carte blanche</em> to the Court to vary division orders given the need to ensure finality in ancillary matters proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal then proceeded to explain that the court may intervene to <em>vary</em> division orders where the order was unworkable, or has become unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This is the oft-cited “unworkability” test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The relevance of contractual vitiating factors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     What is less clear are the situations where the court may <em>revoke</em> division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In <em>AYM</em>, the Court of Appeal recognised that fraud may be a sufficient basis to vary or set-aside a division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal also referred to its earlier decision in <em>AOO v AON</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 1169.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</a> (“<em>AOO</em>”) where a division order made by consent may be set-aside if there has been a lack of full and frank disclosure.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal alluded to the fact that in the commercial sphere, the courts have recognised specific vitiating factors – <em>eg.</em> misrepresentation, mistake, duress, undue influence and unconscionability – which may operate to unravel a binding contract or agreement between the parties concerned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, the Court of Appeal made clear that because the issue before the court did not relate to these vitiating factors, the Court of Appeal declined opining on the precise application (if at all) of each of these vitiating factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Indeed, the Court of Appeal expressly noted that in its earlier decision of <em>AOO</em>, it also “<em>left open the issue as to whether or not a consent order could be set aside on grounds other than the absence of full and frank disclosure of the material facts…”</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the subsequent decision of <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a>, the High Court (Family Division), referring to <em>AYM</em>, held that the power to set aside or vary a consent order on the division of assets must be exercised narrowly and observed in passing that the applicant must provide one of the “<em>vitiating factors</em>”, or that the order was or has become unworkable. However, the High Court did not specify which “vitiating factors” it was referring to, although the parties’ allegations in <em>UMM</em> related to claims involving “<em>duress or misrepresentation</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Finally, it is also useful to have regard to the earlier decision of the High Court in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46305-M.xml')\">[2004] SGHC 275</a> (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”), where the High Court opined that s 112(4) of the WC “<em>should not be construed be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact more equitable in the objective opinion of the court</em>” and that what the court should be alert to is that “<em>one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As <em>Lee Min Jai</em> was decided well before the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>AYM</em> or <em>UMM</em>, it is not entirely clear whether the High Court was referring to the same vitiating factors noted in the latter decisions when it had referred to concept of one party having taken “<em>unfair advantage</em>” over another.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The upshot of the above discussion is that the issue of whether an otherwise binding consent order on the division of matrimonial assets could be set-aside (or varied) on the ground of undue influence and/or unconscionability has not been definitively addressed by the Court of Appeal or by the High Court. Although the High Court in <em>UMM</em> and <em>Lee Min Jai</em> alluded to the possible relevance of contractual vitiating factors and/or just and equitable grounds, the exact contours as to how these principles are to be applied were not discussed in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The doctrine of unconscionability </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the purpose of the present case, <em>both</em> parties’ counsel took the position that the doctrine of unconscionability may apply to set-aside division orders made by consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In particular, both counsel cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>BOM v BOK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22844-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 349</a> (“<em>BOM v BOK</em>”) as providing authoritative guidance of the doctrine in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given both parties’ position on the applicability of <em>BOM v BOK</em>, I will proceed on the basis (without deciding definitively) that unconscionability represents a vitiating factor which allows this court to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In this regard, the Court of Appeal – after undertaking a comprehensive review of the different conceptions of the doctrine of unconscionability in various Commonwealth jurisdictions – held as follows (at [142] – [143]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">142    In summary, and at risk of oversimplification, the <b>narrow doctrine of unconscionability applies in Singapore</b>. To invoke the doctrine<b>, the plaintiff has to show that he was suffering from an infirmity</b> that <b>the other party exploited in procuring the transaction</b>. Upon the satisfaction of this requirement, the <b>burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable</b>. In this regard, while the successful invocation of the doctrine does not require a transaction at an undervalue or the lack of independent advice to the plaintiff, these are factors that the court will invariably consider in assessing whether the transaction was improvident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">143    It is important, though, to reiterate that the application of <b>the criteria of infirmity must not be overly broad</b>, lest we be led back, in effect, to the broad doctrine of unconscionability. It is also important to note that although there might be overlaps between our approach and the broad doctrine of unconscionability – at least because the latter would, by its very nature, encompass situations falling within the former – the broad doctrine of unconscionability still goes further than our approach because it may potentially encompass fact situations where the “special disability” concerned (see Amadio, per Deane J at [132] above) is something broader than the type of infirmity we referred to in the preceding paragraph. That said, an overly broad application of the narrow approach we have endorsed might assist in stretching our narrow approach to cover a fact situation that is not intended to fall within it. We therefore find it imperative to caveat at this stage that our approach ought not to be utilised in such a manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Additionally, the Court of Appeal noted that whether there has been an infirmity on the part of party asserting unconscionability is an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry, and that not every infirmity would be sufficient to invoke the doctrine. The Court of Appeal also noted that “[s]<em>uch infirmity must also have been, or ought to have been, evident to the other party procuring the transaction</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will thus apply the aforesaid legal principles in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Setting-aside a contract due to mental incapacity </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Apart from alleged unconscionability, the Defendant also submits that the Disputed Orders should be set-aside or varied on account of his alleged “incapacity” and mental “incompetence” at the time they were made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As with the issue of unconscionability, neither counsel expressly addressed in their submissions the question of <em>what</em> is the exact legal nature of this assertion and the context under which it was made; counsel appeared to assume that “incapacity” or “incompetence”, if proven, are reasons to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While it might appear obvious, it remains relevant and important to properly situate the Defendant’s arguments. As I would allude to below, the gist of the Defendant’s case is that he was suffering from Adjustment Disorder (with Depressed Mood) and Alcohol Use Disorder (collectively, referred to as the “Disorders”). He therefore argues that he “<em>did not fully understand and comprehend or know the ramifications of what</em> [he] <em>was signing</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In effect, the Defendant is saying that the draft IJ he had signed (which resulted in Disputed Orders being part of the AM Orders) was voidable due to his mental incapacity at that time under the common law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     To be clear, I did not consider the relevance or application of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 as neither party raise the same for the Court’s consideration. I have also proceeded on the assumption that mental incapacity is a contractual vitiating factor which applies to matrimonial division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In <em>North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Megatrucare Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25970-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 110</a>, the General Division of the High Court (“High Court”) noted that the legal test of determining whether a contract is voidable due to a party’s incapacity (as set out in the earlier decision of <em>Che Som bte Yip v Maha Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1989] 2 SLR(R) 0060.xml')\">[1989] 2 SLR(R) 60</a>, a case cited in the Defendant’s Bundle of Authorities) required the party asserting a lack of capacity to prove that the other contracting party <em>knew or ought to have known that he was mentally disordered and had no contractual capacity</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the Defendant’s allegations also involved alcohol use, the High Court’s observations in <em>Resort World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Lee Fook Kheun</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22620-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1039</a> (“<em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>”) are also apposite. In <em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>, a case involving a claim by a casino patron to invalidate a credit facility agreement he had entered into with the casino, the High Court held (at [21]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">21    Intoxication results in impairment of mental capacity, and for that reason has been likened in the law to mental incapacity: see <em>Molton v Camroux</em> (1849) 4 Exch 17,19; 154 ER 1107,1108. A person seeking rescission must show that, first, when he entered into the transaction he was so drunk that he was unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction. This level of understanding was explained by Hallett J in <em>Manches v Trimborn</em> (1946) 115 LJKB 305, 307 as “such a degree of incapacity as would interfere with the capacity of the defendant to understand substantially the nature and effect of the transaction into which she was entering.” Second, the counterparty to the transaction must have known of his infirmity. In <em>York Glass Co Ltd v Jubb</em> (1925) 42 TLR 1 (CA) 2, the claim failed as the counterparty “did not know and had no reasons to know that [the complainant] was out of his mind at the time.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In summary, the principles which may be gleaned from the case law is where a party asserts that he lacked mental capacity (whether by reason of an alleged medical condition, or intoxication) when he had entered into an agreement, that party must show:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that he had no mental capacity at the time he entered into the contract, and that he was unable to understand its general nature and effect; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the <em>other party</em> knew about this infirmity and that he lacked contractual capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is only when <em>both</em> requirements are satisfied that the court would find that the contract is voidable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It follows from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above that the central issue before this Court is whether the Defendant was suffering from mental incapacity (<em>ie.</em> that he lacked contractual capacity when he signed the draft IJ on 7 June 2021), or some form of infirmity (in the context of the Defendant’s case under the doctrine of unconscionability), which the Plaintiff had known, and/or taken advantage, of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The key question was thus whether the alleged Disorders operated on his mind on 7 June 2021 such that it gives rise to an alleged incapacity or infirmity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant has failed to show that he was labouring under any incapacity or infirmity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Defendant has wholly failed to establish his claim that he was so infirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In support of his case, the main piece of evidence relied upon by the Defendant is the medical report which he had obtained from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) in November 2023 (“IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report”), almost 2½ years <em>after</em> he had executed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In gist, the IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report was prepared in response to a request for a medical report on the Defendant and in it, the hospital set out the Defendant medical history and the doctors’ diagnosis (<em>ie.</em> the Disorders) following his admission into IMH on 31 August 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In a follow-up report prepared by IMH dated 22 December 2023 (“IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report”), IMH provided further clarifications on the nature of the Disorders and the possible causes of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, I agree with the Plaintiff that nowhere in the IMH’s 1<sup>st</sup> Report or 2<sup>nd</sup> Report was a definitive statement that the Defendant was <em>in fact</em> suffering from the Disorders in or around June 2021. Indeed, as the Plaintiff’s counsel pointed out in their submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely opined that the <em>symptoms</em> of the Defendant’s Adjustment Disorder “appeared to have started about two to three months prior” to 31 August 2021. This was a largely tentative statement based on <em>inter alia</em> the Defendant’s <em>self-reporting</em> of increased alcohol consumption in the preceding months.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Importantly, the IMH doctor who prepared the IMH Reports expressly stated that he was “<em>not able to comment on the Defendant’s mental capacity retrospectively as</em> [the doctor] <em>had not assessed him when he signed the Consent Order of Court for his divorce matters</em>”. This was a crucial point as that meant there was no objective evidence whatsoever as to whether the Defendant was in fact suffering from the Disorders in June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     What was more critical was the complete absence of any medical opinion or evidence that the alleged Disorders did affect (or was even capable of affecting) the Defendant’s contractual capacity, or his understanding of the Draft IJ. The IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely explained that a person with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood develops “<em>emotional symptoms of depressed mood like feeling low and hopeless in response to identifiable stressor or stressors</em>” and in respect of Alcohol use Disorder, that the individual would spend a great deal of time obtaining or using alcohol and exhibit symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and tolerance. None of the IMH Reports specifically mentions any mental impairment on the individual’s ability to understand or enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It is plainly insufficient for the Defendant to merely point to his physical or mental ailments at a particular point in time, without establishing a link between those ailments and his ability to enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Dorothy Tan (“Ms Tan”), who submitted that the present case is analogous to <em>UMV v UMW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21967-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 60</a> (“<em>UMW</em>”). In <em>UMW</em>, a husband sought to set-aside a draft consent order which he had signed because <em>inter alia</em> he had been taken advantaged of as he was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Mood Disorder at the relevant time when the consent order was signed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In rejecting the husband’s application, the learned District Judge in <em>UMW</em> noted that despite all the medical reports adduced by the husband, none of them “<em>went so far as to say either that the</em> [husband’s] <em>condition had impaired his ability to make decisions at the material time or that his free will had been overborne when he consented to the</em> [consent order]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I agree with the Family Court in <em>UMW</em> that there must be a causal link or connection between a party’s mental state/condition <em>and</em> his ability to understand the draft consent order when he executed it. Otherwise, any party would be allowed to renege on his/her legal obligations years later by pointing to the existence of some mental condition at the time the contract or agreement was signed even though the said condition had no effect on that party’s ability to enter into a binding contract.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant was not exploited or taken advantage of</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The lack of objective documentary evidence in support of the Defendant’s claim of mental incapacity or infirmity must also be weighed against the surrounding circumstances leading up to, and following, his execution of the Draft IJ on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As Ms Tan had pointed out in her submissions – the Plaintiff, through her solicitors, sent draft copies of the relevant divorce papers (which included the Draft IJ) in late April 2021. This was 4 months before the Defendant was admitted into the IMH, and more than 1 month before the Defendant signed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Moreover, the circulation of the divorce papers in 2021 must not be considered in isolation. The Plaintiff also provided evidence that both parties had previously discussed the possibility of a divorce and the division of their matrimonial assets the year before, in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In text messages exchanged between the parties on or around 21 February 2020, the parties discussed the terms of a potential divorce including the transfer of their matrimonial flat to the Plaintiff with “<em>no refund to</em> [the Defendant’s] <em>cpf</em>”. The Defendant then asked the Plaintiff what this proposal meant, and after the effect of such a term was made known to the Defendant, he responded “<em>ok</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was therefore not surprising that in the divorce papers circulated by the Plaintiff’s solicitors in April 2021, clauses were included for the transfer of the matrimonial home without refunds made to the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund (or “CPF”) account, in line with the proposal made the year before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In any case, the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ email dated 30 April 2021 fairly and unambiguously stated that the Defendant was “<em>strongly encouraged</em>” to “<em>seek independent legal advice</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Defendant was also asked to identify any parts of the proposed divorce terms he did not agree with, and to provide his counterproposal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It was within this context that the Defendant responded to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, via email on 5 May 2021, indicating that he had already “<em>signed</em>” a copy of the papers and that the solicitors should verify the same with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s solicitors then replied to the Defendant informing him that arrangements need to be made for him to sign the documents in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths (“CFO”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This was followed by a series of email correspondence between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s solicitors arranging to execute the divorce documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Thus, contrary to what the Defendant’s counsel had sought to argue,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I find that there was nothing in the exchange of correspondence between the parties which suggests any pressure being placed on the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In fact, the Defendant was clear in his email responses that he had wanted to sign the documents to complete the “<em>proceeding</em>”. The correspondence also did not show the Defendant expressing any hesitation or uncertainty <em>vis-à-vis</em> the terms of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties eventually decided on 7 June 2021 as being the date the Defendant would attend before the CFO to sign the relevant divorce papers. The CFO in question was one Ms [N].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Given the seriousness of the allegations relating to the Defendant’s capacity to sign the Draft IJ, the Defendant was directed by the Court (at a Case Conference conducted for the present application) to invite Ms N to provide her response/account as to what had transpired on 7 June 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Ms N stated, in her email reply to the Defendant’s solicitors on 1 August 2024, that she could not recall specifically the event in question given that it occurred in 2021 (some 3 years ago).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> However, Ms N was clear in that it was her practice when asked to witness the execution of divorce documents (for simplified divorce track cases) that she would ask the defendant to go through the papers, especially the draft interim judgment. She will then ask if the defendant understood the contents and whether the defendant agrees with the contents. She will remind the defendant of the clause in the draft interim judgment as regards his right to independent advice. She will only request the defendant to sign the draft interim judgment if the defendant agrees. This process is then repeated for the rest of the divorce papers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In my view, there were no cogent reasons or basis provided by the Defendant to challenge Ms N’s evidence as to what she would normally do, or that she <em>did not</em> carry out the same steps in his case. In fairness to the Defendant’s counsel, he did not seek to challenge Ms N’s position at the hearing of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I thus accept Ms N’s explanation and find that she had undertaken the same process when the Defendant attended before her on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I should add that next to where the Defendant’s and Ms N’s signatures were placed in the Draft IJ, there was appended in clear type-written print the words, “<em>I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice</em>”. This puts in beyond peradventure that the Defendant was not only informed of his right to seek legal advice, he had also freely and independently provided his assent to the terms in the Draft IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, the Defendant’s conduct <em>post</em>-execution of the Draft IJ also reflected his understanding <em>and agreement</em> with the divorce terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In support of the Plaintiff’s case, she exhibited the text messages she had exchanged with the Defendant on 12 August 2021, one (1) week after the IJ was granted by the Family Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In these messages, the Defendant discussed the sale of the parties’ cars and even sought to explain to the Plaintiff how she could reduce the costs of purchasing a new car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     These discussions on the cars are relevant because part of the Disputed Orders required the Defendant to sell the cars and for the sale proceeds to be retained by the Plaintiff. This was also one of the Orders he is now asking this Court to set-aside. If the Defendant was of the view that this was an order which should not have been made, why then did he discuss with the Plaintiff how to implement it? More importantly, there was nothing in the messages disclosed which suggests that the Defendant was dissatisfied with the Disputed Orders, that he did not understand what the Orders meant, or that he was labouring under some form of incapacity or infirmity; he was clear and specific as to what he wanted to inform the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Accordingly, I find that the Defendant was <em>not</em> suffering from any mental incapacity or infirmity which vitiated (or affected) his consent when he executed the Draft IJ. He was not in a state (whether induced by alcohol or otherwise) which rendered him unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Further, and in any event, it is clear from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above (at [22] and [31]) that the mere presence of a mental infirmity on the Defendant’s part is insufficient to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability and/or mental incapacity to set-aside a legally binding contractual document. The Defendant must <em>also</em> show that the Plaintiff knew about the said infirmity and had taken advantage of, or exploited, the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In this regard, I find that the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) <em>did not</em> in any way take advantage of the Defendant in the execution of the Draft IJ. The evidence adduced showed that there were <em>no indicators</em> exhibited by the Defendant which would cause the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) to think or believe that the Defendant did not agree with the Draft IJ, or that he was labouring under any infirmity or incapacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In any event, any doubt which the Defendant could have exhibited by his behaviour or conduct (which I have found not to be present) would have been adequately addressed when the Defendant attended before the CFO and had executed the divorce documents in her presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As stated above, I find that the CFO, Ms N, had ascertained his understanding of the Draft IJ, including his right to seek independent advice and the Defendant had indicated his agreement to the terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to prove the existence of any mental incapacity on his part, or any unconscionability on the Plaintiff’s part, which justifies the Disputed Orders being set-aside or varied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     My finding that the Defendant has not proven that he was labouring under any mental incapacity or infirmity as at 7 June 2021 (or in the overall divorce process) sufficiently disposes of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     However, I will make a few more observations arising from the submissions and issues raised by counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     First, much of the Defendant’s written submissions sought to present his case as one involving some abstract conception of “unfairness”, or that the terms of the IJ was not “just and equitable”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     As Ms Tan had pointed out during her submissions, these abstract references do little to assist the Court in reaching a decision in the case. I would go further to say that a court applies the law, and the relevant legal principles; cases are not decided based solely because one party (or a court) later believes an outcome appears “unfair”. As Choo J in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> had aptly emphasised, s 112(4) of the WC should not be seen as an invitation to rewrite the terms of a settlement so that they appear “<em>more equitable</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> That is not the purpose of the statutory provision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Indeed, the Family Court’s processes and procedures have been designed to ensure that an unrepresented party would be given the relevant opportunity and information to take independent legal advice in cases under the simplified divorce track. For example, litigants are required to execute a draft consent order (or interim judgment) which contains an express clause to remind the litigant of his/her right to independent legal advice and that the terms of the draft order have been agreed to on that basis. To further reinforce this, the unrepresented litigant is required to sign the document before a solicitor or a CFO, who is not acting for the other party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the present case, all of the above procedural safeguards have been followed. Ms N, the CFO, confirmed that she had explained the relevant matters to the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s solicitors too acted appropriately and fairly by emphasising to the Defendant in their correspondence that he could seek independent advice and could even provide counterproposals if he wanted to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I am unable to see how the Defendant was treated unfairly or unjustly. If the Defendant chose to agree to the terms of the Draft IJ and had executed the relevant documents, despite numerous reminders given to him to seek independent legal advice, it does not lie in his mouth now that he had been ignorant to the terms of the Draft IJ because he had not instructed solicitors to act for him at that time. Put simply, a bad bargain is not an unfair bargain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Second, as alluded to above, both counsel appear to accept that the whole suite of vitiating factors (including concepts such as mental incapacity and the doctrine of unconscionability) applies with the same force and rigour to matrimonial consent orders as they do to contracts in the commercial sphere. This is despite the fact that the Court of Appeal has not, in fact, definitively determined the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As the applicability of these vitiating factors was not challenged by the parties, I had applied the same in my determination of the present case. However, my decision should not be taken as the court having accepted the position advanced by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In my view, one could argue that not all contractual vitiating factors recognised in the commercial sphere should apply unattenuated to matrimonial consent orders. As I had noted at [72] above, the execution of draft consent orders in matrimonial proceedings are subject to clear procedural safeguards. The legal force of the eventual order emanates from the court which does not act as a mere “rubber stamp”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This stand in contrast to commercial contracts where similar features may not be present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Further, concepts such as whether the impugned commercial transaction was at a “<em>considerable undervalue</em>” or whether it was “<em>fair, just and reasonable</em>” (arising from the application of the narrow doctrine of unconscionability) may not automatically sit well with other principles of matrimonial law. It is, for instance, not clear whether these concepts are analogous to the principle of “just and equitable” division of the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(10) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     If so, are parties then required to advance hypothetical scenarios/arguments before the variation court as to whether the marriage was a single or dual income, or what approach or methodology should be applied to divide the parties’ assets? These submissions may arguably be necessary if the court is required to assess whether what the parties had agreed under the impugned consent order was better (or worst) of than what the Family Court would hypothetically have ordered if the parties had chosen to undergo a contested hearing for the division of their assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In fact, such difficulties did arise in the present case (albeit in the form of a preliminary issue raised by the Plaintiff’s counsel). At the commencement of the hearing of SUM 1758, the Defendant’s counsel sought to provide the supposed values of the assets mentioned to in the Disputed Orders with the intention of showing how much the Defendant had unfairly “given up” as a result of what he believes to be an “unfair” order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Yet, Ms Tan rightly pointed out that the parties never had the benefit of any court-mandated disclosure or discovery process to ascertain the nature of their assets or the correct value of the same when the IJ was granted, precisely because they had already agreed to settle the divorce amicably. I note that there were also no allegations of material non-disclosure or fraud raised by the Defendant which suggest that he did not know what assets the parties owned (or the value thereof) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The Defendant’s attempt to ascribe values for assets which existed more than 2 years earlier was therefore entirely speculative. This was especially given that the Defendant’s values were unsupported by any objective evidence. There is also the question as to whether the party responding to such assertions (for <em>eg.</em>, the Plaintiff in the present case) would be prejudiced given that he or she would then be required to ascertain the value of assets which may have since been disposed of, or lost, due to the effluxion of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It follows from the above that a court may not be in a position to then use these speculative figures or arguments to ascertain the hypothetical question of whether the terms of the consent order were at an “undervalue”, or that the division order was not “fair, just and reasonable” when it was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     However, as these issues were neither fully argued by the parties nor put before me, I shall say no more on the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Finally, I had, in the analysis set out above, focused on whether the Defendant has provided sufficient basis to set-aside the Disputed Orders. As I have found that he has failed to prove the existence of any incapacity or infirmity, or that he had been taken advantage of, the Disputed Orders will not be set-aside. I will also not <em>vary</em> any of the Disputed Orders for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     To be clear, I did not consider the issue of whether the Disputed Orders (or the AM Orders generally) ought to be varied because of any alleged “unworkability” of specific terms in the AM Order. For example, the Defendant’s counsel alluded to the fact that the deadline for the sale of the parties’ matrimonial assets, as envisaged in the AM Order, has since expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In this regard, I agree with Ms Tan who submitted, in response to the Court’s clarification, that neither party made submissions on the issue of unworkability and, importantly, that the Defendant must be held to what he had specifically prayed for in SUM 1758, <em>ie.</em> for the Court to decide whether Disputed Orders ought to be set-aside or varied for the specific reasons of the Defendant’s incapacity or under the doctrine of unconscionability, and not some other reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     If there are any concerns as to the continued workability of the AM Orders (including whether there has been overpayment by the Defendant through the use of his CPF monies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>), those concerns should be properly ventilated at the appropriate forum when the appropriate application is before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In conclusion, I dismiss SUM 1758 in its entirety as the Defendant has not made out his claim that the Disputed Orders should be varied or set-aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     It leaves me to express my gratitude to counsel for their submissions and, in particular, to Ms Tan for her oral and written submissions which I had found to be clear and detailed, and from which the Court has derived much assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dd 15.07.24 (“PA1”) at [8] and [13] – [24].

I heard the application on 30 September 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       It was the Husband who filed for divorce on 9 February 2024. According to the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”), parties were married on 4 August 2019 in India. Both the Husband and the Wife are Indian citizens.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has been resident in Singapore since 2019 when he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor at one of the local universities (“X”). The Wife remained in India to complete her doctoral degree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The COVID-19 pandemic meant that both the Husband and Wife were kept apart, though they remained in touch via virtual means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties were reunited after travel restrictions had been lifted. They had a good relationship during this time. They went on many trips together. The SOP states that the Husband brought the Wife on numerous trips to Europe in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was not to last. Cracks in the relationship began to form when the Wife began to verbally attack the Husband. They quarrelled over money. The Wife accused the Husband of ruining her career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the state of their relationship, parties agreed to separate, and the Wife agreed to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This did not happen. The Wife returned to Singapore. The SOP states that she began a scorched earth campaign – this included sending complaint letters to the Dean of the local university where the Husband was employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This led to the Husband filing for divorce. The Wife filed her Defence thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> At this time, she was unrepresented. On the 10<sup>th</sup> of May 2024, she appointed counsel: Mr K Jayakumar Naidu (“Mr Jayakumar”) of Jay Law Corporation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Mr Jayakumar subsequently took out SUM 2274 to amend the Wife’s Defence. The purpose of this application was to tidy up the Defence. Mr Jayakumar had formatted the Wife’s Defence and tidied it up as best he could. In doing so, he separated the paragraphs which formed the Wife’s Defence, and the paragraphs which formed her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Pang Khin Wee (“Mr Pang”) of IRB Law explained that the Husband only had a single objection to the proposed amendment which was the inclusion of an allegation that the Husband had used research grant money to pay for the trips to Europe (see above at [5]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Mr Pang urged me to consider Rule 422(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”), which states that the court may at any stage of the proceedings allow any party to amend their pleading, in light of the applicable principles for striking out pleadings which are instantiated in Rule 405 of the FJR 2014. According to Mr Pang, Rule 405 demonstrates that pleadings should not contain scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters. Given that the proposed amendment contains scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters, it should not be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     There is much force to the proposition that the court will not allow amendments to pleadings if the proposed amendments contain matters that are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (to use the language of Rule 405 of the FJR 2014). After all, amendments are generally allowed for “the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [422.02] citing <em>The “Virginia Rhea</em>” [1983 – 1984] SLR(R) 639 at [5] citing with approval <em>GL Baker Ltd v Medway Building &amp; Supplies Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/5141-E-M.xml')\">[1958] 1 WLR 1216</a> at 1231.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     What I have said above, however, would likely only be in issue where the proposed amendment seeks to introduce new facts into the pleadings. In the present case, however, the line which the Husband took offence with was already contained in the original Defence which the Wife had filed. This was what the Wife had stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“My husband, plaintiff took me different places in Europe, using research Grant’s money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This was the proposed amendment:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had brought the Defendant to the various countries mentioned in the SOP with the money the Plaintiff was given as a research grant by [X], the school he was employed by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There is, in substance, no real difference between the proposed amendment, and what was contained in the original Defence. The only changes are, as Mr Jayakumar explained, purely cosmetic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Therefore, even if I am minded to accept Mr Pang’s argument (which, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not) – that the proposed amendment should be rejected, the allegation that the Husband had used money from the research grant to bring the Wife on trips would still remain, warts and all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the circumstances, I will therefore allow the Wife’s application to amend her Defence. The amendments correct a defect in the Wife’s Defence, namely that she had not separated matters that formed part of her Defence, and matters that formed part of her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I shall hear parties on costs. It remains for me to thank both Mr Pang and Mr Jayakumar for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife’s Defence was filed on 28 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supplementary Affidavit dated 14 August 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order – s 65, Women’s Charter – Wrongful Restraint"],"date":"2024-10-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Summons No 762 of 2024","title":"XBN v XBM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 69","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32272-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Complainant in person","The Respondent in person"],"timestamp":"2024-10-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Suzanne Chin","html":"<root><head><title>XBN v XBM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBN <em>v</em> XBM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32272-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 69</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Summons No 762 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Suzanne Chin </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Complainant in person; The Respondent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBN — XBM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">s 65, Women’s Charter</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wrongful Restraint</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Suzanne Chin:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The matter came for hearing before me in respect of cross applications for personal protection orders (”PPOs”). The ex-wife (“Wife”) had applied for a PPO to restrain the ex-husband (“Husband”) from committing family violence against her while the Husband filed an application for a PPO to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After hearing from parties on their applications for PPOs against each other, I granted PPOs in both applications i.e. a PPO in favour of the Husband in SS 640/2022 to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him as well as a PPO in favour of the Wife in SS 762/2024 to restrain the Husband from committing family violence against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has filed an appeal against my decision in SS 762/2024, the Wife’s application for a PPO against him and I set forth below the reasons for my decision. I would also mention that with regard to the Husband’s application for a PPO against the Wife in SS640/2022, during the trial, the Wife had admitted to committing family violence against the Husband on the relevant day and after considering the facts and circumstances, I granted a PPO in favour of the Husband against the Wife as I considered that it was necessary for his protection in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties married on the 4 April 2012 and divorce was granted on the 5 January 2021. The parties have 2 daughters who, at the time of the conclusion of the Ancillary Matters were 11 and 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 11 April 2022, Ancillary Orders were made by the court granting sole care and control of the 2 children to the Wife, with access to the Husband. It was as a result of the older daughter (the “Child”) not returning to the Wife’s residence after one of the access sessions that the series of events that eventually led to the cross PPO applications occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a PPO may be issued if the court finds on a balance of probabilities that (a) family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member; and (b) it is necessary for the protection of that family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 64 defines “family violence” to mean the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The section proceeds to carve out the exception of self-defence by qualifying as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While in the usual case, the first limb of s 65(1) is fulfilled by family violence having been determined to have been committed, it is important to note that a PPO may also be made pre-emptively, where family violence is “likely to be committed” and even if family violence has not in fact been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It should also be noted that the onus rests on the party bringing the application to show on a balance of probabilities that family violence had been committed and that it is necessary for their protection that a PPO be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incidents of alleged violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Both PPO applications were based on a single incident which took place on the 7 January 2024 and I set forth below the account of each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On the 7 January 2024 at around 10pm, the Wife arrived at the Husband’s home with 2 police officers as the elder daughter of the marriage (“the Child”) had not returned from access. According to the Husband, the Wife insisted that the court orders should be complied with and since she had been granted sole care and control of the Child, she wanted the Child to return to her home after the access session. The Husband recounted that the Child refused to return home with the Wife. All of this transpired while the Husband and the daughter were inside his house and the Wife and the 2 policemen were standing outside with a metal gate separating them. The Husband eventually opened the gate on the bidding of the policemen and also the daughter who wanted the gate to be opened. The parties and the Child appear to have continued their discussions and eventually the policemen left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband recounted that shortly thereafter, the Wife started pulling the daughter out of the house by holding onto the child’s body. The Husband explained that at that juncture, he grabbed the Wife’s forearm to prevent the Wife from forcing the Child to leave with her and the Wife reacted by kicking, punching and scratching him. In the meantime, the Child had been released from the grip of the Wife and stood outside the gate. The Wife then told the Child to run to the lift. The Husband recounted that that he held onto the Wife’s right hand and tried to push her out of the house with the intention of trying to stop the Wife from hitting him and also from leaving with the daughter. He maintained that he had used “some strength” but after the Wife started hitting and punching him, he reacted by holding harder onto her hand to stop her. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     By that stage, according to the Husband, the child had run to the lift and at the same time, his mother who was at home at the time surfaced and witnessed the commotion. The child then signalled to her grandmother to call the police, The Wife then told the child to run and the child then went into the lift and left the scene by taking the lift to the ground level. Thereafter the Husband still holding onto the Wife took the lift down with the Wife. He contended that the Wife had been continuously hitting him. As they arrived at the ground floor and stepped out of the lift, they found that police officers had arrived at the scene, and it was at that point in time that he let go of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband maintained that he had not committed Family Violence against the Wife as he had acted in self-defence and had grabbed her purely for the purpose of preventing her from leaving with the daughter against the child’s will and from preventing her from hitting and punching him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Wife recounted that on 7 January 2024 at around 10pm as the daughter had not come home from access with her father, she had gone to the police station and requested that the police accompany her to the Husband’s residence to help her seek the return of the Child. When she arrived at the Husband’s residence with the police, she spoke to the Child who told her that she would go back with her only if the Wife did not pursue the maintenance enforcement application she had made against the Husband. As they continued the conversation, according to the Wife, the Child then started to say that she wanted to go back with her. Shortly thereafter, the metal gate was opened and as the daughter had agreed to go home with her, the daughter put on her shoes and stepped through the entrance of the Husband’s residence into the corridor outside of the house. At that point in time, the Husband grabbed the Child’s hand and started to pull her. The Wife explained that to stop him from pulling the Child back in, she hugged onto the Child and pulled at her. At the same time, she stepped on the Husband’s feet and pressed down hard in the hope that he would let go of the Child’s hand. The Child managed to break free and the Wife then told her to quickly run to the lift to take the lift down. At that point in time, the Wife maintained that she tried to block the Husband and he then grabbed her upper arms forcefully to try to stop her. She then kicked him on the stomach area in a bid to get him to release her. The parties continued in their positions until the Husband’s father came out to try to stop them but the Husband flung off his father’s hand. When the lift door opened, both of them entered the lift and took the lift to the ground floor where they found the police with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife did not deny that she had caused the Husband “hurt” and admitted that she had inflicted family violence on him. She maintained that by the same token, the Husband had also caused her hurt by grabbing onto her upper arms and in this regard she provided photographs of bruises as well as a referral letter written by the medical clinic she had attended on the 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Witnesses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In addition to his account of the incident, the Husband had called his parents as witnesses to provide their version of the incident. The Husband had at the trial indicated to the court that he had intended to call the daughter as a witness in support of his case but just before the trial, the daughter had been warded into hospital as a result of a mental breakdown and remained in hospital for observation. In light of this he could not call his daughter to appear as a witness for the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In contrast, the Wife did not call any witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Family Violence had been committed by the Husband on the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Based on the Husband’s own account, he contended that he had not hit the Wife back but had merely held onto her to restrain her so that she could not force the child to go back home with her. He was also contending that he had restrained her also to stop her from hitting him and accordingly he had not committed any family violence on the Wife but had acted in self-defence. The Wife’s case was that the Husband had caused her hurt by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt and this was evidenced by the bruise she had suffered on upper arms. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, I also thought it relevant to consider if the Husband had inflicted family violence on the Wife by “wrongfully confining or restraining [her] against ..her will”. Accordingly, the questions to be considered are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Husband had caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Upon consideration of the accounts provided by each of the parties as well as the account provided by the Husband’s witnesses, I noted that the Child had clearly been conflicted on the day. I accepted that the Child had spoken to the Wife about dropping the maintenance enforcement claim she had filed against the Husband and appears to have indicated to the Wife that this was a precondition to her returning home. This was not challenged by the Husband but he also explained that the Child had only been willing to return home provided she was allowed to live with both of her parents. Regardless of the actual reason, it was clear that the Child was in two minds about returning to the Wife’s residence but was also not averse to this. The fact that the Child had in the circumstances and after the long discussions put on her shoes suggests that the discussions with both parents had reached the point where the Child was ready to return with the Wife. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that both parties agreed that it was the Wife who had asked the Child to run to take the lift down to the ground level which the Child appeared to have responded to. If indeed the Wife had physically removed the Child against her will from the Husband’s residence as the Husband recounts, it would have been unlikely that the Child would have responded to the Wife’s instructions to run.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband indicated that he had restrained the Wife by holding her by her forearm on that day with a view to pushing her out of the house as she had tried to take the child with her. I did not find that his account made sense and found that the Wife’s account of events appeared to be more consistent and logical. Based on the sequence of events, it would appear that the Child had already agreed to leave with the Wife and had put on her shoes when the scuffle began and it would have been more likely that the Husband had held onto the child’s hand in a bid to prevent her from leaving with the Wife. In response, the Wife had grabbed onto the child who was literally caught in between the 2 parents during the tussle and at the same time started stamping onto the Husband’s foot to get him to release the child. The Wife’s efforts must have paid off as it appears that shortly thereafter, the child was out of the grip of both parents and ran towards the lift. The parties then started focussing on each other with each trying to prevent the other from running to the child. It was not disputed that at this point, the Husband held onto the Wife to prevent her from leaving with the child and in response the Wife started hitting and kicking the Husband in an attempt to get him to release her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I considered the Husband’s contention that as the Wife had continued to hit and kick him, he had no alternative but to restrain her in self -defence. In the case of TEK v TEJ <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a>, the court referred to the Court of Appeal case of Tan Chor Jin v PP [2008] 4 SLR 206 where the concept of private defence was referred to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose….”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on his own account of events, it was the Husband’s position that he had grabbed onto the Wife’s forearms to restrain her from taking the Child with her. According to him, as the Wife grabbed the Child in an effort to pull the Child out of the house, he had grabbed the Wife’s hand to “prevent her from…physical contact…to stop her from pulling my daughter.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was clear that the initial act of restraint by the Husband was not an act of self-defence but was an act of restraint with an intention of restraining the Wife from leaving with the Child. Subsequently as the Wife tried to break free, she started kicking and punching the Husband:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“…. I used some strength… I tried to push her away without holding at first. Then subsequently…. the mother…. after pulling out my daughter, then reacted, ….by kicking and punching me repeatedly… Then I reacted.. by holding…..harder on her hand while to… to try to stop her from hitting me…”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>While the subsequent reaction of the Husband by grabbing onto the Wife even “harder” could be described as a reaction to her hitting and kicking him and can be argued to have been in self- defence, the initial act of restraining the Wife at the outset cannot be considered to be self-defence and in fact, it was apparent that the Wife’s act of “kicking and punching” the Husband was a reaction to the Husband’s restraint as she was trying to break free. I do not think this was a situation where the Husband had found himself “suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation”. The Husband’s act of restraining the Wife led to the Wife’s reaction of kicking and punching him and was clearly a situation created by the Husband himself. Accordingly, I was of the view that the Husband had not acted in self-defence on that occasion. It should also be noted that the restraint by the Husband continued even after the child had left the scene and was no where close to either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In view of this, I concluded that the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     With regard to the bruises suffered by the Wife, which were not challenged by the Husband, it was clear to me that they were as a result of the force used by the Husband in restraining the Wife and I was of the view that the Husband had also caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, based on the above, I determined that on the balance of probabilities, the Wife had proven that Family Violence had been inflicted on her by the Husband during the incident on 7 January 2024. I would add, that while I had reached the conclusion that family violence had in fact been committed by the Husband on the Wife based on the evidence before me, taking into account the continued and heightened acrimony between the parties, their behaviour towards each other during the trial and the fact that there would be ongoing child access arrangements which likely might lead to further disputes between the parties, I determined further that family violence “is likely to be committed” going forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether it is necessary for a PPO to be granted for the protection of the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As the incident in question arose out of the current access arrangements and bearing in mind that there will be continued access by the Husband to both daughters, the likelihood of another similar dispute and incident ensuing is high. In light of this, I determined that it was necessary for a PPO to be granted against the Husband for the protection of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Having considered all of the evidence and submissions before me, I granted the Wife’s application for a PPO against the Husband. It is worth noting that I had also granted the Husband’s application for a PPO for his protection. I had also made counselling guidance orders which required both parties to attend counselling in the hope that this will provide to both of them some insight into their current situation and help them understand the requisite boundaries which should not be crossed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this case, I would also add that the Child has been severely impacted on by the divorce and the continued acrimony between her parents. On the day of the incident, upon the parties’ arrival at the ground floor, they had found the daughter who had taken the lift down earlier, with the police. In his statement, the Husband provided the following account in his police report of the incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“… causing my daughter to break down and wanted to end her life by trying to snatch police gun. My daughter is subsequently suppressed with assistance from the 2 police officers.

She is therefore entitled to costs (see <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). Considering the circumstances of the case, namely that there was not a large number of items pursued in discovery, and that SUM 2194 did not involve any novel questions of law, I fix costs of SUM 2194 at $1500 (all-in). This sum shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife by 12 November 2024. I also order that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum from the Husband, make payment to the Director of Legal Aid as is required under s 16 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (see <em>XDF v XDG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32215-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 82</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As for costs of SUM 2193, which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, the Wife argues that although I had dismissed her application, there should be no order as to costs given that she was legally aided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Here, s 14 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 is relevant.

As Ms Vidthiya had explained during the hearing before me, the Wife had posed those interrogatories because she wanted to know “why the Husband had these debts”. She did not want a situation where the Husband “incur[red] debts and shirk[ed] his responsibility to provide for the children: <em>XCL v XCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a> at [18].

After hearing the parties, I ordered the Respondent to pay to the Complainant spousal maintenance of $2,840 per month but declined to grant any backdated maintenance. The Respondent has since appealed against my decision. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the time of the trial on 29 May 2024, the Complainant was 30 years old and the Respondent was 35 years old. The Complainant was unemployed, while the Respondent worked as an Assistant Professor at a local university (the “University”). The parties married in India on 4 August 2019. There are no children to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the marriage, the Respondent worked in Singapore while the Complainant continued living in India, studying for her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Chemical Biology. The Complainant moved to Singapore to live with the Respondent sometime in October 2022. Parties thereafter lived together in an apartment provided by the University that was located in an on-campus residential estate (the “University Apartment”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime on or around 20 December 2023, parties travelled to India together. The Complainant returned to Singapore on 31 December 2023, while the Respondent returned on 11 January 2024. After the Complainant returned, she did not return to the University Apartment, and the parties have been separated since. While the Respondent continued to reside in the University Apartment, the Complainant stayed with friends until sometime in February 2024. She also travelled back to India for a period in between.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Complainant filed this application on 19 February 2024, seeking maintenance for herself. Since then, and as at the time of the trial, the Complainant lived in a shelter at a location she said she was not at liberty to disclose. She said that she was allowed to stay there for a period of three months, which was almost over by the time I first heard the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The applicable legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Complainant’s application was made under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “Charter”). Under s 69(1) of the Charter, the court may make a maintenance order in favour of a married woman where her husband has proven to have neglected or refused to provide her with reasonable maintenance. In making its determination, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the applicable factors set out at s 69(4) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As there are currently divorce proceedings underway, the maintenance order sought in this application is inherently interim in nature. The objective of such interim maintenance is to tide the complainant over while the divorce proceedings are in progress (<em>AXM v AXO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0705.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 705</a> (“<em>AXM</em>”) at [16]). Where there are pending divorce proceedings, the court will adopt a broad-brush approach in assessing the immediate needs of the complainant, since the issue of what maintenance she should eventually be entitled to will be revisited at the final hearing of the ancillary matters (<em>WGD v WGC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28744-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 69</a> at [30]), where the court is better placed to investigate the full facts of the case (see <em>AXM</em> at [13(c)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Complainant’s primary position was that the Respondent should pay her a lump sum maintenance of $359,628. The Complainant said that this amount was calculated using her estimated monthly expenses of $5,500 per month as the multiplicand and the number of months of the marriage as the multiplier, less the cost of accommodation for the 14-month period she resided with the Respondent, and less the total amount of monies the Respondent had paid her during the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Complainant’s secondary ask was that the Respondent provides her with accommodation, plus a monthly sum of $2,000. If the Respondent does not provide her with accommodation, then she sought a monthly sum of $5,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant said that she required this maintenance until she finds a job that would pay her enough to sustain her lifestyle<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent’s position was that the sum of $400 per month, which he has been paying to the Complainant since February 2024, is sufficient for her maintenance. The Respondent was of the view that the Complainant should return to live in India, and reasoned that this sum of $400 would be sufficient to sustain her living expenses there<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the Complainant’s reasonable expenses be calculated based on her expenses in Singapore or in India?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant claimed that her personal expenses amounted to $5,642 per month. This was based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore, where she was residing as at the time of the trial. The Respondent argued that there was no reason why the Complainant should continue residing in Singapore, and that she should return to India. The Respondent believed that it would be easier for the Complainant to find a job in India and that she has only chosen to remain in Singapore to obtain a higher maintenance amount from the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. As such, the Respondent posited that any maintenance ordered should be based on the Complainant’s expenses in India, which would be significantly lower than her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was not disputed that the Complainant’s expenses in India would be much lower than her expenses in Singapore. After all, the Complainant had previously sustained herself and her widowed mother in India without any contribution from the Respondent and only with an income equivalent to $650 per month, which she received from her fellowship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. However, this fact alone is not reason why the Complainant must return to India to live.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, it is not unreasonable for the Complainant to remain in Singapore, at least pending the conclusion of the parties’ divorce proceedings. The Respondent argues that the Complainant has no family and no connection to Singapore, but this is not entirely accurate: her husband, the Respondent, continues to live and work in Singapore. While divorce proceedings are underway, the interim judgment had not yet been granted as at the time of trial. The Complainant had moved to Singapore in October 2022, ostensibly because the parties had decided that this was where they wanted to reside in together for the next phase of their married lives. There was no suggestion, nor was there any evidence, that this was a temporary move. It is a fact that this was where the parties had lived out the most recent years of their marriage, and the fact of the matter is that as at the time of the trial, the Complainant continued to live in Singapore with no evidence of any plans to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, I am of the view that the Complainant is entitled to defend the divorce proceedings brought by the Respondent in the manner that she deems fit. Just because she had lawyers acting for her in the divorce (as at the time of the trial) does not necessarily mean that this will be the case throughout the course of the proceedings. It is unclear what the scope of her counsel’s engagement was, or if she would have the financial resources to continue to fund this engagement if the divorce proceedings were to drag on. Further, apart from this application which the Complainant took out and litigated on her own, there are various court events that may require the Complainant’s physical attendance, even if she continues to be represented by counsel; a contested divorce trial is one such example, and any future maintenance enforcement proceedings is another. There may also be occasions where parties are required to attend mediation and counselling in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore find that the Complainant is entitled to remain in Singapore, subject to the relevant immigration requirements and regulations. This does not necessarily plant the Complainant’s feet in Singapore, nor does it cast the Respondent’s obligations in stone; in the event that the Complainant does return to India, the parties may seek a variation of any maintenance orders as necessary. However, I did not find it appropriate at this juncture to peg the Complainant’s expenses to the cost of living in India, which may unwittingly force her to return to India, thereby placing her at a possible disadvantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I consequently found it appropriate to assess the Complainant’s reasonable expenses based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Complainant’s expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     With the above in mind, I set out in the following table the monthly expenses that the Complainant claimed to incur<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, as well as my decision on them, taking into account the Respondent’s arguments with respect to the Complainant’s expenses:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"21.1357728454309%\"><col width=\"23.2953409318136%\"><col width=\"14.5170965806839%\"><col width=\"41.0517896420716%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Item</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Complainant’s position</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Decision</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>My reasons</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Rent</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2,900</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,800</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I elaborate on my reasons at paragraph 19 below. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Utilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">This was not substantiated but was not specifically contested by the Respondent.

To explain and elaborate further on my findings with respect to the Complainant’s rental expenses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Complainant was living in a shelter and was only allowed to stay there for 3 months. Even if an extension of her stay was permitted by the shelter, I did not find this to be a sustainable living arrangement for her, and certainly not one that was commensurate with the parties’ standard of living during the marriage. I therefore found it reasonable for her to seek suitable accommodation elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In support of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 for rental expenses, the Complainant provided a screenshot of some WhatsApp messages from one ‘Jeviar House’<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, which purported to be a conversation with a property agent that she had in March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. These messages indicated that the cost of renting a one bedroom and one bathroom fully-furnished HDB unit at 119 Bukit Merah View was $2,900. The Complainant said that she was open to living in cheaper accommodation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and considered renting a bedroom in a shared apartment. However, the unit that she found at a cost of $1,500 per month required her to share the apartment (which was a HDB flat in Jurong) with a male tenant, which she was not comfortable with. She therefore did not follow up on this<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I found the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month to be on the high side. I found it hard to believe that the Complainant was unable to find accommodation in Singapore that would cost her less than $2,900 per month, especially since she was open to renting a bedroom in a shared residence. The Complainant also did not provide any evidence showing her efforts made to find alternative accommodation, apart from the abovementioned WhatsApp messages. I further note that the Complainant never provided the listing for the unit at 119 Bukit Merah View, which would have shown the full details of this property. However, from the preview of this listing as can be seen in the messages provided, it appears that this was for the rental of an entire HDB 3-room flat, which would explain the higher monthly rental cost of $2,900.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the other hand, while the Respondent contested the reasonableness of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month, he did not provide any evidence showing the cost of alternative accommodation. The Respondent only asserted that this should be around $1,100, which was an amount he surmised based on his conversations with his interns at the University<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent also never questioned the Complainant’s evidence that renting a room in a shared apartment in Jurong would have cost her $1,500, nor did the Respondent make any submission to suggest that this was an unduly high amount for a room in a shared apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I therefore found that the sum of $1,800, which is slightly more than the sum of $1,500 that the Complainant said she was previously quoted for a shared apartment in Jurong, would be reasonable and sufficient for the Complainant to find a suitable accommodation for herself. In arriving at this conclusion, I also considered that the Complainant may have a more limited pool of options to choose from given the availability of female-only shared residences (which I did not find to be an unreasonable preference on her part) as well as the difficulties that the Complainant may face in actually securing an accommodation because of her uncertain immigration status.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The parties income and financial resources</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established that the Complainant’s reasonable expenses amount to $2,841 per month, I turn to assess the parties’ incomes and financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Before moving from India to Singapore, the Complainant received an allowance equivalent to about $650 per month from her fellowship. The Complainant has a PhD and, by her own account, was hopeful of obtaining a job in Singapore that would pay her about $5,000 to $6,000 per month. The Complainant said that she had been looking for post-graduate positions and applying for jobs. She had even attended interviews in August 2023 and in January 2024. By all accounts, the Complainant had the inclination to work and appears to possess the requisite qualifications to find a decent job. However, the reality of the situation is that the Complainant has never worked in Singapore and that she remained unemployed as at the date of the trial. Given the Complainant’s circumstances including the nebulous nature of her immigration situation, I found it hard to say if and when the Complainant would be able to gain employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Further, there was limited evidence before me on the financial resources available to the Complainant, save for some bank statements disclosed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, which revealed that her savings in Singapore and India total no more than the equivalent of $8,000 as at April 2024. There was nothing to suggest that the Complainant was in possession of undisclosed financial resources that would be able to tide her through the proceedings notwithstanding her state of unemployment, and the Respondent never made any assertions or submissions to this effect. I therefore accepted that the Wife was not in a position to pay for her reasonable monthly expenses in this interim period without contribution from the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In contrast to the Complainant’s financial situation, the Respondent earned a substantial income and had significant financial assets to his name. The Respondent’s own evidence was that he earned an average of $14,676 a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. His IRAS Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2024 showed that he received a total of $217,550 from his employment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, which translates to about $18,130 per month. Based on his declaration in his Electronic Template Statement (“ETS”), the value of his bank accounts and fixed deposits alone total over $360,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent, to his credit, candidly stated at trial that he could technically afford the monthly maintenance amount sought by the Complainant (of $5,000 per month)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. This cohered with my assessment of his financial means and his expenses. The Respondent’s personal expenses, as declared in his ETS, amount to $4,656.06 per month. I found that he was more than able to afford both the Complainant’s claimed maintenance amount and his own expenses, even if I were to take his stated expenses at face value without conducting a full analysis of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the circumstances as set out above, I ordered that <u>the Respondent shall pay to the Complainant a sum of $2,840 per month (rounded down) to the Complainant as her maintenance, payable on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month, starting from 21 June 2024</u>. It was evident from the disparity in quantum between the amount I had assessed as the Complainant’s reasonable expenses ($2,841) and the amount that the Respondent had been paying to the Complainant each month ($400) that the Respondent’s contributions have been insufficient. I found that this was not out of ignorance on the Respondent’s part, as the Respondent was patently aware of his obligations and had voluntarily transferred to the Complainant a sum of $400 per month, or for want of communication on the Complainant’s end, as the Complainant had sent an email to the Respondent on 4 January 2024, specifically requesting that he provided her with shelter and financial support<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Rather, this appears to have been premised on the Respondent’s view that the Complainant should return to India, which I found was not a fair and reasonable view to hold in the circumstances. I therefore found on the facts that the Respondent had indeed neglected to provide the Complainant with reasonable maintenance, and that a maintenance order in the Complainant’s favour was warranted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I declined to order the lump sum maintenance of $359,628 sought by the Complainant at this stage. The Complainant’s request stemmed from her belief that the Respondent should have provided but did not provide her with maintenance from the beginning of the marriage. However, prior to moving from Singapore to Osaka in October 2022, the Complainant was voluntarily living in India and earning an allowance. After moving to Singapore, she moved in to stay with the Respondent in the University Apartment, where they lived as a couple and even went on various overseas trips together, which the Complainant did not have to pay for. There was no evidence of her being in lack, nor was there any evidence of the Complainant seeking monies from the Respondent. I therefore did not find that the Complainant had proven her case in this regard, and in any case, I did not deem this to be an appropriate or justifiable mode of payment in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the same reason, I also declined the Complainant’s request for backdated maintenance for the period prior to January 2024. For the period thereafter, the Complainant stayed with friends, returned to India for some time, and lived in a shelter. She had sufficient funds to subsist during this period and did not incur any accommodation expenses during this period. During the Complainant’s stay in the shelter, most, if not all, of her daily needs were provided for.

My substantive decision can be found in <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32204-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 77</a>. This is my decision on the costs of SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife had, in her submission on costs, tabulated the sums incurred from the commencement of divorce to date. This includes sums for things such as her lost wages for January to September 2024. The total sum comes in at $33,400. The Wife, however, has not stated, in her submissions, whether she should be entitled to costs of SUM 1769, nor has she stated her position as to the quantum of such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband, on the other hand, submitted that costs should be awarded in his favour, fixed at $1,279.68 (all in). The costs that the Husband is seeking covers, amongst other things, his disbursements incurred in obtaining the various bank statements which he had disclosed in his reply affidavit to SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Where costs are concerned, it is trite that costs follow the event – in other words, the party who has succeeded in the proceedings is entitled to costs. That said, the court can depart from this starting point, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. It also bears noting that in family proceedings, the court may make no order as to costs with a view towards minimising acrimony and discontent between the parties: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, it is the Husband who is entitled to costs. This is because he had succeeded in resisting the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories – the Wife did not obtain orders in respect of the majority of the items that she sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In fixing the quantum of costs, I take into account the number of items that the Wife had sought in respect of her application for discovery and interrogatories. I also take into account the fact that some of the items which the Wife had asked for in SUM 1769 had not been raised in her earlier requests for discovery or interrogatories (“RFDIs”). This meant that the Husband never had the opportunity to provide voluntary disclosure. I do not take into account the disbursements which the Husband had incurred in giving discovery of the documents sought – after all, the “costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery”: <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Costs are, in the circumstances, fixed at $1,500 (all-in). This sum is to be paid by the Wife to the Husband by 21 October 2024.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Inspection of original of document exhibited in affidavit"],"date":"2024-09-30","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 5893/2022 (FC/RA 7/2024)","title":"XCZ v XDA","citation":"[2024] SGFC 78","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32246-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Tan Xuan Qi Dorothy and Ms Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the Plaintiff","Ms Julie Tok Law Corporation (Julie Tok Law Corporation) for the Defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-10-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>XCZ v XDA</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCZ <em>v</em> XDA </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32246-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 78</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">D 5893/2022 (FC/RA 7/2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">30 September 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chia Wee Kiat </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Tan Xuan Qi Dorothy and Ms Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the Plaintiff; Ms Julie Tok Law Corporation (Julie Tok Law Corporation) for the Defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCZ — XDA </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Inspection of original of document exhibited in affidavit</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">30 September 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In FC/SUM 1115/2024 (“SUM 1115”), the Wife applied for the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_1\"></a>1)     That the Defendant, on reasonable notice, produce at M/s Julie Tok Law Corporation, situate at 21 Merchant Road Level 4 (SPACES) Singapore 058267, the following document, namely the original Agreement for Personal Loan dated 27 February 2016 (exhibited at Page 148 of the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 1 August 2023), and that the Plaintiff and/or her solicitors be at liberty to inspect and peruse the document so produced, and to make notes of their contents, and be entitled to be supplied with copies thereof on payment of the proper charges;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_2\"></a>2)     Costs; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_3\"></a>3)     Such other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       FC/RA 7/2024 (“RA 7”) is the Husband’s appeal against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Tan Zhi Xiang (“the AR”) given on 10 June 2024 granting an order-in-terms of prayer 1 of SUM 1115.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       RA 7 came up for hearing before me on 16 August 2024.

It would make no sense for her solicitors to inspect a copy of the Loan Agreement which had already been provided in the DAOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife believes that the Loan Agreement and its authenticity and veracity are relevant and necessary for disposing fairly of the matter. The alleged loan of close to $1.15 million stated in the Loan Agreement forms a substantial portion of the Husband’s alleged indirect contributions towards the matrimonial home. It will have to be determined if the Loan Agreement is a genuine document, or simply an afterthought, drafted and signed by the Husband and his mother once divorce proceedings were likely, to preserve a larger share of asset for the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Given the importance of the Loan Agreement and the huge impact it could have on the case, the Wife does not believe that the Husband has misplaced the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Further, the Wife says that the Husband had previously given her a coloured-version of the same Loan Agreement. She believes that that Husband’s excuse that he has misplaced the Loan Agreement is a convenient excuse to avoid a forensic testing of the original document. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband does not dispute that the Loan Agreement is significant and relevant. In his Reply Affidavit, the Husband says that the Loan Agreement is documentary evidence of the substantial portion of his direct financial contributions towards the matrimonial home and will certainly have a bearing on the determination of the division of the matrimonial home. It is an authentic document which he would be relying on in the ancillary matters hearing. Similarly, his mother would be relying on the Loan Agreement for the return of the monies to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband says that the monies extended under the Loan Agreement were meant to be a loan to him and not a gift.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> He explains as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to Paragraph 13 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit, I would reiterate that the Plaintiff and I were physically in the US, in the State of California then. The Loan Agreement was signed sometime in or around July/August 2016 after our return to Singapore. There was never any denial that my mother and I had decided to backdate the Loan Agreement to 27 February 2016 as it was a day after the last date that the last cheques were dated. We had felt that doing so would be an accurate representation of the agreement. If the Plaintiff had needed to know details like these, she could have requested for them when parties were exchanging the various Requests for Interrogatories and Discovery, which were followed by several rounds of exchanges of clarifications. There is no discrepancy whatsoever as untruthfully alleged by the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Husband says that he was working off a copy of the Loan Agreement for his DAOM. When asked by the Wife’s solicitors to produce the original copy for forensic examination, he did not know that the original copy of the Loan Agreement was already lost at that point in time. He had thought that it was kept somewhere and could be located.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> It was only when he attempted to look for the original copy of the Loan Agreement that he realised that it was lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband says that notwithstanding that the Wife had been informed that he did not have the original of the Loan Agreement, the Wife proceeded to serve on him the NP.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In compliance with the said notice, his solicitors were compelled to serve the NI on the Wife, essentially stating that a copy of the Loan Agreement could be inspected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, no one turned up at his solicitors’ office for the inspection.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> His solicitors immediately followed up with an email dated 28 March 2024 to put on record the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We refer to the above matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We wish to put on record the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Vide your letters dated 12 and 13 March 2024, your client had requested for a forensic examination of the Agreement for Personal Loan exhibited at Page 148 of our client’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 1 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">1.    Our client’s reply vide our email dated 20 March 2024 informed you that our client was <u>unable to locate the original of the document</u> requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    Despite the same, your client proceeded to serve our client with a Notice to Produce Documents Referred To In Pleadings or Affidavits on 21 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.    Our client’s Notice of Where Documents May Be Inspected was then served on you on 25 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">4.    The date of inspection was scheduled on 28 March 2024 between the hours of 10 am and 11 am at our office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">5.    However, the inspection did not take place as no one from your good office turned up at our office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">6.    There was no courtesy of an email to inform us of your client’s instructions to abort the inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">7.    Time has been unnecessarily wasted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">8.    Our client’s rights are hereby reserved, including but not limited to asking for costs of today’s aborted inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband says that there was no suggestion that he was objecting to producing the original Loan Agreement for inspection as alleged by the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> As he had stated clearly in his solicitors’ email dated 20 March 2024 that the original was lost,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> the Wife ought not to have proceeded to serve on him the NP.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband reiterates as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the Plaintiff is entitled to her beliefs, which in this case, I would say is wholly unsubstantiated. However, the truth of the matter and as I have reiterated, is that the ORIGINAL of the Loan Agreement cannot be found. It is worth noting that the document was made some eight (8) years ago. With the passage of time, the ORIGINAL document had unfortunately been misplaced and cannot be found. We do not know when the ORIGINAL copy was misplaced over the past eight (8) years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I would reiterate that when I instructed my solicitor to write to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, the first and foremost concerns I had amongst others, were the Plaintiff’s intention and purpose of obtaining the Loan Agreement for a forensic examination and how the chain of custody of the document would be maintained, all of which were valid concerns, if the said document was to be handed to the Plaintiff. I was trying to locate the ORIGINAL Loan Agreement then and did not know that the ORIGINAL was already lost at that point in time. I was working off a copy of the Loan Agreement for my Affidavit of Assets and Means. I had only realized that the ORIGINAL of the Loan Agreement was lost when my attempts to find it, failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband contends that this was not a case where he had offered inspection of a copy instead of an original document, which defeated the purpose of inspection. Rather, it was the Wife who ought not to have taken out and served the NI on the Husband when she was aware and had knowledge that the original of the document was lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s reply</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife says that when she returned from the United States to Singapore by herself for a period of about two weeks in February and March 2016, she viewed the matrimonial home with the Husband’s mother and the agent, without the Husband being present. Throughout the view, the Husband’s mother did not mention at any point in time that she intended to loan monies to them for the purchase of the matrimonial home. This was despite the fact that the Loan Agreement was allegedly backdated to the time when she was in Singapore and viewing the matrimonial home with the Husband’s mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife says that there is a significant discrepancy in the date of the Loan Agreement and the actual date of signing as alleged by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> She did ask for more details in relation to the Loan Agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> but the Husband had been less than forthright about the discrepancy, which gave her significant cause to doubt the veracity and authenticity of the Loan Agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife believes that the Loan Agreement was signed as an afterthought when divorce proceedings were commenced by her sometime in December 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The fact that a loan agreement in respect of a sum of more than $1,100,000.00 can be lost is simply suspect. The Husband only claimed that the document was lost after he realised that he could not avoid a forensic testing of the document, despite raising concerns about the chain of custody.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife says that the NP was clearly with reference to the original Loan Agreement, since there is no point in her solicitors inspecting a copy of a document, with the said copy already being exhibited in the Husband’s DAOM. It would make no sense at all for the Husband to provide inspection of a copy of the Loan Agreement, when the authenticity of the Loan Agreement is in dispute in the first place.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s NI made a mockery of the process of inspection by offering for inspection a copy of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The AR’s decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In granting the Wife’s application via Registrar’s Notice dated 10 June 2024, the AR noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It cannot be seriously disputed that the inspection of the purposed (<em>sic</em>) loan agreement is relevant and necessary, given the quantum of the alleged loan and the dispute over the authenticity of the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Court is unable to accept, at this juncture, the Defendant's claim that the agreement is lost. The Defendant did not provide details on efforts made to locate the agreement; he has only made a bare assertion that it is lost. Further, it is curious that the Defendant claimed that the agreement was lost only after the Plaintiff stated her intention to send the agreement for forensic testing. The backdating of the agreement also appears odd. However, I emphasise that these views are expressed for the purpose of this application only. The Defendant is entitled to adduce further evidence to show that the agreement is lost, and the hearing judge is, of course, not bound by my views.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 19 June 2024, the AR provided supplementary grounds, noting that the application raised the interesting question of the correct approach to adopt when a party who has been served a notice under rule 65 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”) claims that the document is lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The AR was of the view where a party has chosen to refer to a document in an affidavit, the other party is generally entitled to that document, and the Court should be strongly inclined to order production. It is not a pre-requisite for the making of the order that the respondent be in possession, custody or control of the document, although it can be a relevant factor. Where the document is not in the possession, custody or control of the respondent, the respondent must demonstrate reasonable efforts to obtain the documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The AR found that the Wife was <em>prima facie</em> entitled to inspect the Loan Agreement since the Husband had chosen to refer to it in his affidavit. The burden is on the Husband to prove “good cause” why the order cannot be made. The AR found that no “good cause” was shown because the Husband offered nothing more than a bare assertion that the Loan Agreement is lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The AR noted as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He has not explained the steps he has taken to locate the agreement. He has not explained where and when it was last seen. He has not explained why he was at one point able to obtain a colour copy of the agreement. Thus, from the evidence, he has made at most “only the lamest of efforts” in obtaining the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The AR was of the view that if a bare assertion that a document is lost can amount to a full defence to an application under rule 66(1) of the FJR, that rule would lose much of its force.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     A judge hearing a Registrar’s Appeal exercises confirmatory jurisdiction, as opposed to appellate jurisdiction. Although I may accord appropriate weight to the AR’s decision, I am not bound by the manner in which he exercised his discretion. This is clear from <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053.xml')\">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053</a> at [38] where it was held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… A judge in chambers who hears an appeal from the Registrar is entitled to treat the matter as though it came before him for the first time. The judge in chambers in effect exercises confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge’s discretion is in no way fettered by the decision below …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I begin by setting out the applicable rules. Specifically, rule 65 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Inspection of documents in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65.—(1)    A party to an action or matter may at any time serve a notice, in the relevant Form, on any other party in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document, requiring the other party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to produce that document for the inspection of the party giving the notice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to permit the party giving the notice to take copies of the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 7 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice (called in this paragraph the second notice) in the relevant Form —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    stating a time within 7 days after the service of the second notice at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the second notice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Rule 66 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Order for production of documents for inspection</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">66.—(1)    If a party who is served with a notice under rule 65(1) —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fails to serve a notice under rule 65(2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    objects to producing any document for inspection;

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    stating the belief of the deponent that the documents are in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given of them under rule 63 or pursuant to any order made under that rule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Finally, rule 73 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery, inspection and answers to interrogatories to be ordered only if necessary</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">73.    On the hearing of any application for an order under rule 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 or 71, the Court —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    may, if satisfied that discovery, inspection or answers to interrogatories are not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the action or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    must in any case refuse to make such an order, if and so far as the Court is of the opinion that the discovery, inspection or answers to interrogatories are not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     A summary of the above rules, insofar as they are relevant to the present application, is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_1\"></a>1)     A party to an action may at any time serve a notice on any other party in whose affidavit reference is made to any document, to produce that document for inspection: see rule 65(1) FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_2\"></a>2)     If a party who is served with the notice fails to serve a notice under rule 65(2), the party <em>entitled to inspection</em> may make an application to the Court for an order for the production of the document for inspection: see rule 66(1)(a) FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_3\"></a>3)     An order for production will be made only if it is necessary: see rule 66(1) r/w rule 73 FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband contends that the AR erred in citing rule 66(1) as not requiring the respondent to have possession, custody or control of the relevant document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The Husband submits that rule 66(1) is not to be read alone. As rules 63 to 77 apply to all matters involving ancillary or financial relief, the rules must be read in their entirety. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband points out that rules 63(1)(a) and (b) specifically require the Court to first determine whether the document described in the application had been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, and if it was in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, then to exhibit a copy of the document in the affidavit, and if not in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, to state when he parted with it and what has become of it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Husband contends that the AR erred under rule 63 in not making an order requiring the Husband to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified in the application satisfied rules 63(1)(a) and 63(1)(b)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and instead proceeded to grant an order-in-terms of the Wife’s application without considering the affidavit, which the Husband ought to have been ordered to file.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The Husband contends further that the AR erred in any event in not dismissing the Wife’s application since rule 63(2) only required the Court to order a party to exhibit a copy of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Respectfully, I did not find the Husband’s arguments persuasive. It should be noted that the Wife’s application is not an application for discovery under rule 63(1). It is an application for production of document for inspection under rule 66(1). Rules 63(1) and 66(1) are distinct provisions dealing with different types of applications, each with its own requirements. It would be incorrect, as a matter of statutory interpretation, to conflate them by importing the requirements in rule 63(1) into rule 66(1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It is clear from a plain reading of rule 66(1) read with rule 65 that there is no requirement for the respondent to have possession, custody or control of the document. All that is required is that the respondent has made reference to the document in an affidavit. Once that requirement is satisfied, the other party to the action is <em>entitled to inspection</em> of the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     An application under rule 66(1) may be contrasted with an application under rule 66(2). Unlike rule 66(1), rule 66(4) specifically requires that an application for an order under rule 66(2) must be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the document is in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given to them under rule 63 or pursuant to any order made under that rule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I note in this regard that a similar approach was adopted in <em>SK Shipping Co Ltd v IOF Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHCR 0014.xml')\">[2012] SGHCR 14</a> (“<em>SK Shipping</em>”), which concerned an application by the defendant, pursuant to, <em>inter alia</em>, O 24 r 11 read with O 24 r 10 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), for the production and/or inspection of documents referred to in the Statement of Claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     O 24 r 10, which is the equivalent of rule 65 of the FJR, provides for the inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits. It states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits (O. 24, r. 10)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    Any party to a cause or matter shall be entitled at any time to serve a notice in Form 40 on any other party in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document requiring him to produce that document for the inspection of the party giving the notice and to permit him to take copies thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 4 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice in Form 41 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the notice, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     O 24 r 11, which is the equivalent of rule 66 of the FJR, states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Order for production for inspection (O. 24, r. 11)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    If a party who is required by Rule 9 to serve such a notice as is therein mentioned or who is served with a notice under Rule 10 (1) —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fails to serve a notice under Rule 9 or, as the case may be, Rule 10 (2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    objects to produce any document for inspection; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    offers inspection at a time or place such that, in the opinion of the Court, it is unreasonable to offer inspection then or, as the case may be,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">then, subject to Rule 13 (1), the Court may, on the application of the party entitled to inspection, make an order in Form 42 for the production of the documents in question for inspection at such time and place, and in such manner, as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to paragraph (1), but subject to Rule 13 (1), the Court may, on the application of any party to a cause or matter, order any other party to permit the party applying to inspect any documents in the possession, custody or power of that other party in respect of which discovery has been given under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    An application for an order under paragraph (2) must be supported by an affidavit specifying or describing the documents of which inspection is sought and stating the belief of the deponent that they are in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given of them under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As observed by the learned Assistant Registrar Justin Yeo in <em>SK Shipping</em> (at [32]-[33]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    While no Singapore cases were cited to me on this point, the English case of <em>Rafidain Bank</em> is instructive. In <em>Rafidain Bank</em>, it was held that the omission of the requirement of “possession, custody or power” from the equivalent RSC provision was, as a matter of construction and common sense, a “deliberate” one (<em>Rafidain Bank</em> at 1610H). This is because the party who refers to the documents in his pleadings or affidavits does so <em>by choice</em>, and usually because these documents were either essential to his cause of action (or defence), or of significant probative value to him (<em>ibid</em>). These do not presuppose that the said documents would be in that party’s possession, custody or power (<em>ibid</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    The court in <em>Rafidain Bank</em> further emphasised that <b>there was no reason why the broad scope of O 24 rr 10 and 11(1) should be restricted such that an order may only be made pursuant thereto if the documents sought are in the possession, custody or power of the party to whom the order if made is directed (</b><b><em>ibid </em></b><b>at 1613E). This should be contrasted with O 24 r 11(2), which contains the “exceptional restriction” that the making of an order pursuant thereto is dependent on whether the documents sought to be inspected are in the possession, custody or power of the party to whom the order if made is directed (</b><b><em>ibid</em></b><b>).</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In the present case, the Husband has made reference to the Loan Agreement in his DAOM. Pursuant to rule 66(1), the Wife is “entitled to inspection” of the Loan Agreement. In compliance with rule 65(1), the Wife served the NP on the Husband. It is clear from the chronology of events narrated above that the Husband was well aware that the NP was a request to produce the <em>original</em>, and not a <em>copy</em>, of the Loan Agreement for inspection, as a copy of the Loan Agreement had already been exhibited in his DAOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In purported compliance with rule 65(2), the Husband served on the Wife the NI giving notice that a <em>copy</em> of the Loan Agreement may be inspected. As the request by the Wife was for the production of the <em>original</em> Loan Agreement, there was a failure on the part of the Husband to comply with rule 65(2). It bears reiterating that rule 65(2) requires the party on whom a notice to produce a document is served to state whether he objects to the production of the document in question. Hence, the Husband is required to state whether he objects to the production of the <em>original</em> Loan Agreement, which is the document in question. By skirting the issue and giving notice that a <em>copy</em> of the Loan Agreement may be inspected when that was not the document in question, the Husband has failed to comply with rule 65(2). Consequently, the requirement in rule 66(1)(a) of the FJR for the Court to invoke its power to order production is satisfied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband has sought to argue that s 67(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1893 contemplates the situation where the original of a document is lost, but a copy of the said document remains admissible as secondary evidence of its contents. This may explain why rules 62, 63, 65, 66 and 73 of the FJR do not require specifically that an original of the document be produced or inspected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I did not find this persuasive as s 67(1)(c) is an evidential provision. There is nothing in s 67(1)(c) or the rules that limit the right of a party entitled to inspection to inspect only a copy of the original document. Indeed, it would make no sense for any such restriction to be imposed as this would defeat the purpose of the inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The crux of the matter, as correctly identified by the AR, is the correct approach to be adopted when a party who has been served a notice under rule 65(1) of the FJR, claims that the document is lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband asserts that a copy of the Loan Agreement was in his possession, custody and power but not the original of the said document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> As the original of the document was lost, there cannot be an order to produce the same, as that would put the Husband in a position of impossibility to comply with the order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The issue as to whether the Court is powerless to make an order for production where a party asserts that it lacks possession, custody or power was considered in <em>SK Shipping</em> which observed (at [34]-[38]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… given that the court has discretion <em>vis-à-vis</em> whether or not to grant an order for production under O 24 r 11(1), the absence of possession, custody or power may be a <em>factor</em> taken into consideration in the exercise of such discretion. <b>The absence of possession, custody or power will “sometimes amount to a good cause” not to order production of such documents, but not “invariably” so</b> (<em>Rafidain Bank</em> at 1611B). The court in <em>Rafidain Bank</em> gave, as an example, the case of a “technical” absence of possession, custody or power where there is evidence that the third party who had possession of the document would very likely make it available if only he was asked to do so. The court was of the view that in such a situation, there was no reason that the court should be powerless to make an order for production, despite the respondent’s lack of possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it should be emphasised that in <em>Rafidain Bank</em>, <b>the “technical” lack of possession, custody or power was cited as an </b><b><em>example </em></b><b>(and by no means an </b><b><em>exhaustive </em></b><b>one) in which courts will order production where a party asserts that it lacks possession, custody or power over the documents in question</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is clear from <em>Zida</em> that it is insufficient for the party refusing discovery to demonstrate <b>“only the lamest efforts</b>” in requesting the necessary documents from the relevant third party (<em>Zida</em> at [59]). Where the efforts to obtain the necessary documents are “undistinguished by zeal” (<em>Zida</em> at [55]), the fact that the relevant third party refuses to cooperate is <em>per se</em> insufficient for the party refusing discovery to <b>discharge its onus of showing “good cause”</b> (see <em>Zida</em> at [51]-[59]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In summary, the following principles may be derived. The Court has a discretion whether or not to grant an order for production. The onus is on the party refusing production to show “good cause” why the Court should not order production. The absence of possession, custody or power may be a factor taken into consideration in the exercise of such discretion. It may sometimes amount to a “good cause” but not invariably so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Husband contends that he had affirmed an affidavit stating that the original Loan Agreement was lost, thereby putting himself at risk of perjury if he had lied about the loss of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> However, this begs the question whether the Husband’s affidavit ought to be treated as conclusive. As noted above, the AR did not accept the Husband’s claim that the original Loan Agreement was lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In the absence of any case authority directly on point, I find it helpful to derive guidance from an analogous situation in a discovery application. In <em>Lutfi Salim bin Talib v British and Malayan Trustees Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31221-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 85</a>, the defendant appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s order that the defendant produce three categories of documents. One of the issues in the appeal related to the conclusive nature of the defendant’s statement on affidavit that it did not have any further documents in its possession and/or control with respect to two of the categories. Chua Lee Ming J held (at [32]-[33]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    Thus, there is authority that under the previous versions of the Rules of Court, an affidavit in respect of discovery of documents was not conclusive if there was a <em>reasonable suspicion</em> that further discoverable documents existed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    However, in my view, this “reasonable suspicion” test has no place under O 11 r 3 of the ROC 2021. For the purposes of deciding an application under O 11 r 3(1), a respondent’s opposing affidavit and any subsequent affidavits filed in response to a previous order under O 11 rr 3(1) or 3(2) of the ROC 2021 are conclusive and the court should not go behind the affidavits unless it is <em>plain and obvious</em> from the documents that have been produced, the respondent’s affidavits or pleadings, or some other objective evidence before the court, that the requested documents (a) must exist or have existed; (b) must be or have been in the respondent’s possession or control; or (c) are not protected from production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Hence, an affidavit in respect of discovery of documents is not conclusive if there is a “reasonable suspicion” that further discoverable documents existed (under the previous versions of the Rules of Court) or it is “plain and obvious<em>”</em> from the respondent’s affidavits or some other objective evidence before the Court, that the requested documents must be or have been in the respondent’s possession or control (under ROC 2021).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In my view, as the rules of discovery in the FJR were derived from the previous version of the Rules of Court and the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R4), the “reasonable suspicion” test would be the more appropriate test to be adopted for the purpose of the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Having carefully considered the Husband’s Reply Affidavit and the objective evidence before the Court, I found that there is a reasonable suspicion that the original Loan Agreement existed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Firstly, the Loan Agreement was allegedly signed by the Husband, his mother and the property agent in Singapore and the three of them were allegedly present at the same location. It would be odd if none of the parties present was able to recall the location where the agreement was signed. The Husband’s reply, in response to the Wife’s interrogatory as to where parties signed the document, that <em>he</em> is “unable recall the exact location where the agreement was signed”, gives cause for doubt whether he has been forthcoming. This is because the question by the Wife is not whether the Husband is able to recall, but “[w]here parties signed the document”. Even if the Husband is unable to recall as he has asserted, could he not have checked with his mother or the property agent who were present? The ambivalent reply by the Husband leaves open the question whether any attempt was made to check with the others and whether they too, could not recall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Secondly, each of the alleged signatories dated the Loan Agreement as “27/2/2016”. However, the Husband has given evidence that the Loan Agreement was signed in July or August 2016, after he had returned from the United States. On the face of the document, the Loan Agreement is plainly misleading since it was not executed on 27 February 2016. This material discrepancy in the Loan Agreement, discovered as a result of the interrogatories administered by the Wife, highlights the need for evidence relating to the Loan Agreement to be scrutinised with care. However, the evidence provided by the Husband is sorely lacking in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Thirdly, the fact that the Loan Agreement was allegedly executed six months after the loan had already been extended is a suspicious circumstance by itself that warrants a proper explanation. The lack of details provided by the Husband as to how the Loan Agreement came about not only fails to dispel the suspicion but reinforces it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Fourthly, since the purpose of the Loan Agreement is ostensibly for the mother to rely on it for the return of the loan, it would have been obvious to ask whether the mother has the original copy. Notedly, the Husband has merely stated that he is unable to locate the original copy, without saying whether the original was kept by him or his mother, or whether he has checked with his mother, whom, it should be noted, was the one who drafted the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Lastly, it seems too convenient that the Husband only realised that the original document was lost after his solicitors were informed by the Wife’s solicitors that the Wife intended to obtain a forensic examination of the said document to determine the veracity of his claim regarding when the document was signed. While the Husband has explained that he only realised that the original copy of the Loan Agreement was lost after he attempted to look for it, the veracity of his explanation must be assessed against the above backdrop, the importance of the document, and the consequential degree of care one would ordinarily expect in the safekeeping of an important document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     On the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the AR was justified in rejecting the Husband’s claim that the agreement was lost. In my judgment, there is a reasonable suspicion that the Husband is withholding the original copy to avoid a forensic examination of the document. An order for production is clearly necessary given the relevance and significance of the Loan Agreement to the division of the matrimonial home. As the Husband has failed to discharge the burden of proving “good cause”, I was not persuaded to exercise my discretion in his favour not to order production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Finally, I should state for completeness that the Husband has sought to argue in his request for further arguments that he had exhibited not a photocopy of the original hardcopy of the loan agreement, but a printed copy of the softcopy. The Husband says that he should not be obliged to produce the original hardcopy since he was referring in truth to the softcopy. The Husband contends that whether or not the softcopy is authentic will depend on the presumption in s 116A of the Evidence Act in relation to electronic records.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I did not find any merit in this fresh argument. Whether the Husband had exhibited a photocopy of the original hardcopy of the Loan Agreement or a printed copy of a softcopy does not affect the entitlement of the Wife to request for inspection of the original document. The onus is on the Husband to prove that he does not have the original document and has made reasonable efforts to produce the original document, which he has failed to show.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     For the above reasons, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 836/2024 was the Husband’s application against the Wife for a personal protection order (“PPO”). I heard the trial on 3 September 2024 and dismissed the Husband’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In order to succeed in his application, the Husband had to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an act of family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961, and that it was necessary for the PPO to be granted for his protection: s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961; <em>WNU v WNV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29868-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 18</a> at [10]; see also <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [6] – [14]. For ease of analysis, the definitions of family violence are set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       During the course of the trial, the Wife told me that she wanted to consent to the Husband’s application for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I could not accept this. The Wife had also said, in the same breath, that she wanted to do so out of a desire to get the matter over and done with. She hoped that the Husband would not create problems for her if she gave him what he wanted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There are serious consequences stemming from the grant of a PPO (see <em>CSW v CSX</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 204 at [14] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a>; <em>WNU v WNV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29868-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 18</a> at [6]). I was not satisfied that the Wife fully appreciated this. I therefore proceeded to deal with the matter based on the evidence before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A video was played in court. It had been recorded by the Husband on 3 April 2024. It showed that the Wife had slapped and scolded him. The Wife had also hurled several vulgarities at him, told him to “go kill himself”, and threatened to leave him for another man. The Wife does not dispute having done so in her testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The acts shown in the video speaks for itself. By slapping the Husband, I find that the Wife had committed an act which fell within the definition of limb (b) of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       These acts of family violence complained of stemmed from the problems which the Husband and Wife had encountered in their relationship. It was clear, from their testimony, that they were unable to resolve their conflicts in a healthy and productive manner. This led to frequent arguments which not only gave rise to the incidents of family violence complained of, but also caused the Wife to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is against this backdrop that I assessed the necessity of granting a PPO for the Husband’s protection, and arrived at the conclusion that it was not necessary to make such an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband had testified that he had shifted out on 3 April 2024 and that he is no longer in contact with the Wife. He had also said that they had not been in contact since 22 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife had also given evidence that she wanted to, and had every intention of, cutting the Husband out from her life. She did not want any contact with the Husband. She had blocked him on social media as well as Whatsapp. She wanted nothing else to do with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was clear to me, from the evidence, that neither the Husband, nor the Wife, has a desire to be in contact with the other. They have both set their lives on diverging paths. Given the distance and separation they have created between each other, in what appears to be an attempt to move on, there will be fewer opportunities (if at all) for conflict, which obviates the need for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I therefore dismissed the Husband’s application for a PPO in SS 836/2024 with no order as to costs.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Relocation"],"date":"2024-08-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons Guardianship No 164 of 2023, Originating Summons Guardianship No 38 of 2024","title":"XBE v XBF and another matter","citation":"[2024] SGFC 67","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32219-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Plaintiff/Husband.

They have 3 children B (XX September 2016), aged 7 who will turn 8 this year; D (XX September 2018), aged 5 turning 6 this year and E (XX September 2020), aged 3 turning 4 this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a 41-year-old Indonesian citizen who used to hold Singapore PR status. She discovered through ICA in or about November 2023 that her Singapore PR status was terminated although she had prior approval that this was to continue through for 5 years until May 2028. With effect from September 2022, she resides in Indonesia and works in her family business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant is a 38-year-old Singaporean citizen and is a university lecturer. He was the Managing Director and CEO at XXX International Pte Ltd and worked full-time. He had a change in job profile in October 2023 or thereabouts. He is now a university lecturer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Plaintiff was a fulltime homemaker and stay home mum after the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After the marriage, the parties and the children lived at ET Place with the Defendant’s parents. They had the assistance of domestic helpers. The Defendant’s father used to be a teacher and retired in 2019. The Defendant’s mother is a Senior Nurse and continues to be gainfully employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In December 2021, the Plaintiff said that she rented an apartment at The M and a lease agreement was entered into for a year from January 2022 to January 2023. There was a disagreement as to when the parties moved into The M. The Defendant said March 2022; the Plaintiff said February 2022. There was also a dispute as to why the lease was taken up. The Plaintiff said that the Defendant kicked her out and that he moved in later after they reconciled in February 2022. The Defendant said they were going to move into his apartment in Paterson (The XXX) which was then still being rented out with the lease ending in January, coinciding with the end of the lease at The M. Nevertheless, the parties and the children lived together at The M until 6 August 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant’s parents stayed on at ET Place until this was sold in June 2022. They then moved into The M with the couple whilst awaiting the completion of their new place at The W. However, they then sold The W in July 2022, and they purchased a unit at The XXX, in the same condominium compound as the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Plaintiff and the children left for Indonesia on 6 August 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The children’s stay in Indonesia 6 August 2022 – 31 October 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There is no dispute that the parties went to Bali, Indonesia to attend the Plaintiff’s brother’s wedding scheduled on 29 September 2022. The parties withdrew the 2 older children from their kindergartens so that the children could spend more time with their maternal grandparents and relatives. The Plaintiff and the children flew to Jakarta, and they stayed in Indonesia from 6 August 2022 until an intervening event which will be discussed. They flew to Bali on 25 September 2022 whilst the Defendant arrived on 26 September 2022. The Plaintiff’s brother’s wedding took place in Bali on 29 September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Plaintiff said that the Defendant exhibited violent behavior towards her on 29 September 2022 and that this was witnessed by her father. The Defendant conceded that the parties had an altercation on 29 September 2022, but he said nothing had come out of it. He then discovered that the Plaintiff and the children were missing the next day. He said that the Plaintiff’s father and other family members of the Plaintiff as well as 2 policemen informed him that the Plaintiff and the children would stay on in Indonesia for a while. The Defendant claimed that he had no choice in the matter and returned to Singapore with the parties’ domestic helper. He said he later found out the Plaintiff and the children had flown to Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     What was not disputed was that from end September 2022, the Plaintiff and the children remained in Jakarta, staying with the Plaintiff’s parents. The 2 older children started attending school with the younger child being homeschooled because of his young age. The children were also attending various extra-curricular activities in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant went to Jakarta on various occasions as set out in the Plaintiff’s affidavit. He would spend extended periods with the children of at least 7 days to 14 days in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 31 October 2023 on one such visit, the Defendant removed the children from Jakarta and returned to Singapore. He did not have the children’s passports but was probably assisted with the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta. He has not given details of this to date. The Plaintiff was the one who retrieved the information from the Indonesian Immigration Authorities on 4 November 2024. Since then, the children have remained with the Defendant at The XXX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     On 21 November 2023, the Plaintiff commenced proceedings in Singapore vide OSG164/2023 for the interim sole custody care and control of the children and for the children to be returned or relocated to Jakarta. She commenced divorce proceedings in Jakarta on 30 December 2023. The parties attended a compulsory mediation session on 19 June 2024. The divorce proceedings are live in Indonesia. The Plaintiff informed that the ancillary matters would be dealt with in Indonesia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Defendant cross applied for sole custody care and control of the children in OSG38/2024 on 2 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision – children to be returned to Indonesia and relocation of the children allowed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After reading all the affidavits, considering the documents and hearing the parties, I granted an order for the children to return to Jakarta in Indonesia and to continue to remain there in the care of the Plaintiff. The children are to therefore to be relocated to Indonesia. Consequential orders for access with the Defendant were also dealt with and parties worked out the terms with specific inputs from the Court where there was no agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Defendant’s application was also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Principles of relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The general principles with regards to relocation are stated in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. It is trite law that the welfare of the child is paramount in deciding relocation cases, and this principle ought to override any other consideration. This is dependent on a multitude of factors which may impact what is best for the child’s welfare. It is a fact-centric exercise. The reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver to relocate is also considered as it may affect the child’s welfare, because the child’s emotional and psychological welfare is generally intertwined with that of the primary caregiver. Loss to the child of his or her relationship with the left-behind parent is also an important consideration but it is not of determinative weight in every case. The court is also to consider the child’s wishes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I find that it is in these children’s welfare to be returned to Jakarta and to be relocated to the place where they had stayed with the Plaintiff, their mother for a period of some 13 months before the Defendant’s unilateral removal of the children from Jakarta to Singapore on 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I set out the reasons for my decision taking into account the following factors:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>a)     That the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>b)     The Defendant’s role as a parent before 31 October 2024 and post 31 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>c)     The paternal grandparents’ role did not displace the Plaintiff as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>d)     The Defendant’s care of the children after return to Singapore from 31 October 2023 did not displace the Plaintiff’s role.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>e)     The Defendant consented to the children staying in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_f\"></a>f)     The Defendant had regular contact with the children in Jakarta and there was no loss of relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_g\"></a>g)     The Plaintiff’s caregiving in Jakarta and relocation plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_h\"></a>h)     The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay in Jakarta with the children due to the Defendant’s conduct i.e. the Defendant’s violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_i\"></a>i)     Primary caregiver’s wishes to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_j\"></a>j)     Children’s wishes and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_k\"></a>k)     Loss of parental relationship and claims of alienation</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff is the children’s primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As a starting point, I made a finding that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver save for the period of 31 October 2023 to July 2024 when she was deprived of the children through the Defendant’s actions of 31 October 2023. This period of absence from the children’s lives was involuntary and caused by the intervening event of their removal from the Plaintiff’s care by the Defendant. It did not however mean that she lost her role or that it had been displaced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff’s contributions towards the children’s caregiving as the children’s primary caregiver and a homemaker have been set out in affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     She set the children’s daily routine, taking care of their medical needs and overseeing their health; showering the children, preparing all the children’s meals from purchase of the groceries, to cooking and cleaning up, cutting fruits for them, managing the children’s prams, teaching the children how to walk, getting them ready whenever the parties went out etc. She also encouraged and developed their social development through games and arts and crafts. It is pertinent to note that the Defendant worked fulltime from their births.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When the children remained in Jakarta following the parties’ altercation on 29 September 2022, the Plaintiff continued to be the children’s primary caregiver. She ferried the children to school, was involved in their school life, put them to bed, brushed their teeth, planned their meals etc.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Plaintiff even prepared meals for the Defendant and the children when he visited them in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     More importantly, the Defendant acknowledged in an email dated 3 October 2022 at page 54 of P1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, that the Plaintiff “<em>have done much more than (he) in handling the roles of both a wife and a mother on a full-time basis, at long hours too</em>.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Although they had domestic helpers, the Plaintiff carried out caregiving responsibilities, while the domestic helper focused on household chores. The Plaintiff also produced a WhatsApp chat dated 13 July 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, detailing the domestic helper’s household responsibilities. The WhatsApp chat corroborated her version of events that indeed the domestic helper’s role was confined to household chores whilst the Plaintiff concentrated on caregiving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Having found that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver, it is in their best interests for the children to remain with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I also refer to <b><em>ULA v UKZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22490-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 19</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> in which weight was given to the relocating parent’s desire to relocate. The Court considered the ways that such relocation would benefit her and held that as the relocating parent is the child’s primary caregiver, the child’s happiness and wellbeing are connected to her and cannot be divorced from hers. In the same vein, the Plaintiff herein is the children’s primary caregiver and the three young children’s welfare, and wellbeing are connected with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s role as a parent before 31 October 2024 and post 31 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Notwithstanding the Defendant’s present narrative as to his involvement and that of his parents; whilst important, those efforts were secondary to the primary care the Plaintiff exerted over the care of 3 young children from birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Defendant worked fulltime until he removed the children from Jakarta on 31 October 2023. The Plaintiff gave some contextual background to the Defendant’s work history and said that he was a workaholic<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. He also pursued his post-graduate education in Switzerland sometime around the end of 2019, and the family moved there for his studies. As he was studying, the care of the young children resided with the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Plaintiff’s account of the Defendant’s lack of time with the family to the extent of only spending minutes a day was also supported by the Plaintiff’s exhibits of WhatsApp messages to her in-laws in October 2019 and in June 2020. He watched videos on YouTube and played online games to the extent that the Plaintiff asked for help from her in-laws to speak with the Defendant for help with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Defendant also did not want to sleep with the Plaintiff and the children at home, as he said they were noisy. The Plaintiff had to convert the Defendant’s study room into a bedroom for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Plaintiff also submitted that the Defendant made personal trips without the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In the circumstances, the Defendant’s account of his caregiving must be considered contextually and against the facts of this case. His narration of his detailed caregiving of the children only occurred after 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The paternal grandparents’ role did not displace the Plaintiff as the primary caregiver </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the paternal grandparents, B was born in 2016 but the paternal grandfather retired from his fulltime job only in 2019 some 3 years later. D was born in 2018. The Defendant and his parents thus worked fulltime until the paternal grandfather’s retirement in 2019. The paternal grandmother continues to hold down a fulltime job. The primary care of the three young children was left to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Defendant said the paternal grandfather assisted in caregiving and pointed out to some ferrying of the children as well as text messages from the paternal grandmother giving tips to the Plaintiff on how to care for one of the children who was ill. He also submitted that the parties had the assistance of domestic helpers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The paternal grandparents might have supported the care of the 3 children but their roles could not be considered primary caregiving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Whilst the Defendant submitted that that his parents “heavily assisted” with taking care of the children, there was no evidence of this before 31 October 2023. The Defendant repeated in various WhatsApp messages that his parents were elderly and, “...<em>aged a lot and health deteriorated</em>”, and his father’s latest audio report stated that he had severe hearing loss<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The Defendant’s father suffered chronic chest pains and was admitted to hospital, as stated in the Defendant’s WhatsApp message dated 29 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I have no doubt that the paternal grandparents love the grandchildren and supported the Plaintiff and Defendant as much as they could but it could not be said that the paternal grandparents were the children’s caregivers. I find that the role rested with the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Defendant’s care of the children after return to Singapore from 31 October 2023 did not displace the Plaintiff’s role</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Since the children’s abduction by the Defendant from Jakarta, the Defendant claimed that the children have a new routine. He claimed that he is a hands-on father and he referred to the affidavits from the Chinese tuition teacher and a friend to support this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As set out earlier, this routine was created by the Defendant when he abducted the children from Jakarta. He then started the children on formal schooling for B and other classes for the two other children. He claimed to have resumed his caregiving role and he also left his regular job to become a stay home father, working as a lecturer with limited hours of teaching.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I did not agree with this narrative as the Defendant abducted the children and removed them from the Plaintiff’s care. The children had lived with the Plaintiff in Jakarta from 29 September 2022. His removal of the children from Jakarta on 31 October 2022 and retaining them with him in Singapore did not transform him to be their primary caregiver especially when he retained them without the Plaintiff’s consent or prior knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Plaintiff pointed out that there had been delays in the proceeding caused by the Defendant filing his reply affidavit and cross application only in April 2024. The Defendant claimed that parties were negotiating and that he only requested one extension of time. However, for various reasons, his affidavit and various applications were only filed in April 2024. This was 5 months after the Plaintiff’s application. By the time this matter came for final hearing, 7-8 months had passed. The Defendant should not take advantage of this by claiming that the children have a new routine when this was caused by his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I also did not see this “routine” as insurmountable; the comparison was not timeframes in which the children were in Jakarta <em>vis-a-vis</em> timeframes in Singapore. The starting point is that the Plaintiff is the children’s primary caregiver. The children were removed from her care. They were then put into a new routine which I found to be artificially created by the Defendant. Their removal from their primary caregiver was also not in their best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In fact, the Defendant has not provided any evidence that he was/is the primary caregiver from their birth. The Defendant, his domestic helper and his parents did not displace the Plaintiff as the children’s primary care giver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Defendant had a tuition teacher, Chen XXX filed an affidavit on April 2024 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>about his caregiving. It is pertinent to note that she did not refer to the Defendant’s mother being at home which was consistent with the fact that the Defendant’s mother continued to work. Chen XXX set out in affidavit that she met the Defendant in January 2024. She filed the affidavit in April 2024 and made general statements that the Defendant was invested in the children’s studies. I placed little weight on her affidavit as this was commissioned by the Defendant to garner support for his case; she was the tutor for a short span of time which coincided with the Defendant’s claim of a new “routine” for the children; her statements were general, and she was in no position to have compared the Plaintiff’s care with the Defendant’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Defendant also had a friend (R) file an affidavit on 17 April 2024 about what a hands-on father he was. However, the affidavit was unhelpful as the said friend interacted with the Defendant only when the children had play dates. The friend concluded that the Defendant was a good father because he discussed education syllabus with him. The friend was not able to expand on more than that. I did not place weight on the evidence regarding the Defendant being the children’s primary caregiver given the limited content of the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Plaintiff also submitted there that the Defendant and/or his domestic helper and/or parents were negligent <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>with the children’s care. I did not place too much weight on this as parties would tend to overstate their positions in the advancement of their case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The pertinent point to note is that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver and the separation of mother and children was caused by the Defendant’s intervening act of removing them from her. His attempts to build a narrative as the children’s primary caregiver must be taken in context of his fulltime job (before 31 October 2023), the Plaintiff’s primary role, and the other matters that are set out here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant consented to the children staying in Jakarta</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I also find that the Defendant consented to the children remaining in Jakarta. The Plaintiff’s decision to remain in Jakarta stemmed from incidents in the marriage (elaborated further below) in which he told the Plaintiff that she could take the children and return to Jakarta if he was violent again. This was corroborated by the video recording produced by the Plaintiff in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     From the Defendant’s text messages and emails, he accepted that the children would live in Jakarta. He also told the Plaintiff to enroll the children in an international school in Jakarta; corroborated in text messages between the parties and his subsequent actions. He visited the children’s school in Jakarta and participated in events when invited by the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     His messages to the Plaintiff of 12 September 2023 were reproduced in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“... I will be going over next week Thursday and spend time with you and our children. I hope we can stay together and I’m willing to live there with you all. Let’s discuss? ...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(text message from the Defendant on 20 January 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“If you think being in Indonesia is better, let’s discuss it as long as we can be together as a family.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(text message from the Defendant on 19 March 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“... Kindly give our children and family a chance in Jakarta.” (text message from the Defendant on 2 July 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Let us restart (if you insist in Jakarta) for our children and family.” (text message from the Defendant on 9 August 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Dearest, I beg you to please let our family reunite. I’m willing to move to Jakarta. ...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Defendant also stated in his email of 9 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“I have done everything I can and am really at my wit’s end on how to salvage our dear family. My last solution is to go to you, leave Singapore and live with you and our children in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please kindly give me the 1<sup>st</sup> and last chance at trying a new life for our family IN JAKARTA. I will support you in whatever you wish to do.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In <b><em>TUC v TUD</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20876-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 877</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, the High Court discussed a parent’s consent to relocate in the context of Section 13(a) of the Hague Convention. The High Court stated that there must be proof on the balance of probabilities that the left-behind parent consented to the child being removed to or retained in a different country. Although this is not a case under the Hague Convention, I find that the principles are relevant, and that the Defendant’s words and conduct indicated a clear consent for the children to live in Jakarta. The fact that the Plaintiff and the children stayed on in Jakarta for 13 months also evidenced this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In <b><em>VMY v VMZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25265-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 94</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Court ordered that the father be permitted to relocate with the children to the United Kingdom and have care and control of the children. In the case, there was an email in 2019 where the mother confirmed that she was agreeable to the children relocating in the summer of 2021. The children attended classes to prepare for grammar school in the United Kingdom and in contemplation of the children moving to an international school which followed the United Kingdom school curriculum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In this present fact situation, the Defendant’s conduct and messages confirmed his consent. The Defendant did not refute these messages. He even suggested that he would relocate to Jakarta to be with the Plaintiff and the children. He also went to Jakarta and spent extended time with the children (discussed below). I find there was no ambiguity in what the Defendant said and that he meant what was said. The Defendant did not address these messages and emails in his replies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant had regular contact with the children in Jakarta</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Although counsel submitted that the Defendant was unsure of whether he would have contact or access with the children each time he went to Jakarta, it was undisputed that the Defendant saw the children. The Defendant had no issues travelling to Jakarta on various occasions for access as set out <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>a)     27 January 2023 to 5 February 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>b)     8 April 2023 to 9 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>c)     12 April 2023 to 13 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>d)     14 April 2023 to 15 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_e\"></a>e)     20 May 2023 to 21 May 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_f\"></a>f)     26 May 2023 to 28 May 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_g\"></a>g)     24 June 2023 to 26 June 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_h\"></a>h)     28 June 2023 to 2 July 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_i\"></a>i)     3 August 2023 to 14 August 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_j\"></a>j)     15 September 2023 to 18 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_k\"></a>k)     22 September 2023 to 28 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_l\"></a>l)     25 October 2023 to 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Plaintiff also offered the Defendant undisturbed phone calls with the children twice a week<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. This was corroborated by the Defendant at paragraph 32 of D1 and his parents were also present at the weekly video calls<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. He sent an email on 9 May 2023 that he had access to the children when he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“</em>In the meantime, I am to continue the current routine of seeing our children (B, D and E) in Jakarta as often as I can every month or so, and kindly continue to video call my parent and I during every Wednesday and Saturday at 7pm (SGT) / 6pm (JKT) so we can talk with and see the children.”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     On the evidence, the video calls commenced 2 days after the Plaintiff and the children stayed in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     There is no concern that the Defendant would be deprived of contact with the children when they relocate to Jakarta. The Defendant in his own messages stated that was to “continue the current routine” of seeing the children as often as he could, every month or so. The dates listed in paragraph 59 also showed that he did have access to the children regularly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff’s caregiving in Jakarta and viable relocation plan</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     On the other hand, the Plaintiff continued her role as the children’s primary caregiver when they lived in Jakarta from 29 September 2022 to 31 October 2023. She can continue her role once the children return to her. The children’s care should not be substituted with a domestic helper or grandparents, especially if a parent is readily available to be with the children. This is one such case in which the Plaintiff would be continuing her caregiving of her three young children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As for a relocation plan, this was not an issue as the children lived in Jakarta and were attending school/classes there for 13 months. This was not the usual relocation case in which one parent questioned the viability of a relocation plan. The children already lived in Jakarta for more than a year before their removal by the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The children lived with the Plaintiff and their grandparents at Apartment XXX Indonesia. The Plaintiff had assistance from her parents although she said this was required. She also had the assistance of domestic helpers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The children attended school in Jakarta at XXX de Jakarta since November 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The children attended various extra-curricular activities and tuition classes in Jakarta. B attended gym sessions, taekwondo, wushu martial arts, ice skating, artistic swimming classes, baking and cooking classes, painting, paddle, singing classes, Chinese and French lessons. D attended gym, taekwondo, wushu martial arts, Chinese lessons, and piano lessons. The Plaintiff has exhibited numerous photographs of the children which were taken in Jakarta<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. E was home schooled by the Plaintiff in Jakarta as he was only slightly over 2 years old then<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Plaintiff purchased insurance in Jakarta. She brought them for regular medical and dental checkups when the children lived in Jakarta. Copies of the policies were exhibited<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Plaintiff has an extensive extended family in Jakarta, whom the children are familiar with, including cousins, aunts, uncles, and their grandparents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I also address the Defendant’s submission that that there was a lack of contact between the Plaintiff’s parents and the children when the children lived in Singapore before August 2022. The Plaintiff denied this allegation as her parents visited Singapore about 4 times from B’s birth. Her sisters visited Singapore several times. The children also visited Jakarta with the Plaintiff on numerous occasions and met up with her extended family and the children are not unfamiliar with their maternal grandparents. In any event, I did not see this as a concern as the children have lived with the maternal grandparents for 13 months and had been meeting with their aunts, uncles and cousins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     On the other hand, the children do not have any cousins or any other extended family members from the Plaintiff’s side of the family in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Upon the children’s return, they would continue with their stay at the Plaintiff’s parent’s home and they would return to their routine of 13 months before they were wrested from the Plaintiff’s care. They would be looked after by their mother, their primary caregiver. There was no real concern about a viable relocation plan as the children lived in Jakarta. They had a life in Jakarta and they would be returning to that life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay in Jakarta with the children – the Defendant’s voice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay on in Jakarta with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     She had a legitimate concern about the Defendant’s issue of anger and violence. He has also been caught on recordings bad-mouthing the Plaintiff to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     During the marriage, the Plaintiff had been subjected to the Defendant’s violent behavior. She suffered multiple wrist and back injuries and produced a TCM report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>: The Defendant had been physically violent to the Plaintiff even when she was 7 months pregnant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. He admitted to abusing the Plaintiff as seen from the Plaintiff’s video recording dated 21 July 2019’. He had choked the Plaintiff, pushed her off a bed while she was nursing one of the children; pulling her down the bed when she was heavily pregnant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>; pushed the Plaintiff on the wardrobe countertop when she put on a nice dress to meet a friend etc.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The family lived in Switzerland for the Defendant’s post-graduate studies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. When the family was in Switzerland, the landlord in Switzerland received a complaint because of the Defendant’s shouting (at the children and the Plaintiff).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     On 21 July 2019, the Defendant admitted that he had hit the Plaintiff, and reassured the Defendant that she could leave with the children, if he ever hit her again. The recording is relevant and reproduced:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Defendant: If it happens again, you can just walk with the kids.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me: No, you say...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant: You can just walk with the kids.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Woman: (0:06) You say...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Man: (0:06) I don’t like this kind of recording.

The Plaintiff’s father also filed an affidavit setting out what he had seen of the Defendant’s conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The Defendant’s parents themselves were also aware of the Defendant’s anger management issues. They spoke to him about this anger and even suggested that the Defendant sought help.

B is still very young and need a lots of parents love and nurturing. She can be playful and stubborn at times but you cannot vent your anger on her under whatever circumstances. Papa and Mama don’t raise you like that using hard approach on B. She may be scarred emotionally and have deep hatred for you when she grow up. I don’t think that is what you wanted. You told Papa before you want to give your children the best. If you really cannot control yourself, please go for help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Plaintiff’s father spoke to the Defendant about the Defendant’s abuse over a 3-hour conversation which was recorded.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     On one occasion, the Defendant hit B near her eye. B can be heard in the recording stating that the Defendant had poured alcohol on her in his fits of anger. The extracts of the recording on 26 May 2022, taken by B are as follows and the full version is set out at paragraph 35 of P2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (0:09) B, Okay? Okay? If your mother does not even have the decency to explain that to you, she is not fit to be your mother because that is the fact. I did not aim at your eye.

Very good.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (2:04) That is the cheekbone. Okay? This is ... very near to your eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (2:09) It’s not the eye, B. Cheekbone and eye are two different things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (2:12) So the fact that Papa aimed there, it is not right.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (2:15) I did not aim at your eye, B.

Oh no!</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (6:50) Very hard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (6:56) No, I don’t want to beat you like the way Papa does. Because when Papa does that to Mama, Mama gets bruises all over.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (7:02) No, Mama hits Papa and Papa gets bruises and Mama uses vulgarities and bad words on Papa.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (7:09) Does Mama even hit Papa?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Girls (7:10) No.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (7:16) I know why she sprays water at Papa because...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (7:19) Yeah, I spray water at Papa.

Do not aim at her face. Do not aim at her head. She was literally covering her face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (8:20) You could have talked to me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Woman (8:21) And the moment her hands went down, you hit her there.

You broke my pelvic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (11:42) What kind of behaviour you had?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (11:43) You punched me. You hit me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (11:45) You hurt my wrist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Man (11:47) Okay? You do that same thing to me as well. Okay?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (14:06) I still remember when we were... when we were with family. With Yeye (paternal grandfather) and Nainai (paternal grandmother). I was naughty. And then papa put alcohol in my face. I still remember that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (14:15) Yeah. That was very bad.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (14:16) All over your face. I’m so sorry about that, B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (14:18) B, B.

That’s not a good memory to keep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The Defendant had raised in submissions that the Plaintiff did not file an application for a Personal Protection Order (PPO). The Plaintiff was alone in Singapore with 3 young children and her immigration status was tied to the Defendant. I did not place too much weight on the submission of a lack of an application for a PPO in the circumstances of this case: the Plaintiff was a foreigner living in her husband’s country and depended on him. She would have to continue living with the Defendant after filing the PPO and that would be an unsustainable outcome.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In the case of <b><em>ABZ v AYZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, the High Court allowed the wife’s relocation to the United States. The husband’s appeal was dismissed. The Court held that the wife’s decision to relocate was understandable as she was vulnerable, alienated and isolated in Singapore. The wife had no family members or close friends in Singapore to support her. She underwent a difficult divorce and suffered a loss of self-esteem caused by years of abuse by the husband. The wife also did not hold permanent residency in Singapore. Notwithstanding the wife’s work experience in her younger days, given the years she spent as a homemaker, the High Court held that it would be difficult for her to re-enter the workplace.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In the same vein, the Plaintiff in this case worked when she was younger but became a fulltime homemaker and the children’s primary caregiver throughout the duration of her marriage. She was isolated here without familial support and then subjected to violence not only targeted against her, but which spilled over to the children. That is of concern. The Plaintiff and the children should be given this opportunity to heal with familial support and the children be brought up in an environment without stress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Further, the Plaintiff’s immigration status in Singapore is uncertain. On 12 May 2023, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (<b>“ICA”</b>), informed the Defendant that the Plaintiff’s Permanent Resident (“PR”) status would be valid for “5 years” <em>i.e.</em>, until 12 May 2028.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     On 6 November 2023, when the Plaintiff visited ICA, she discovered that her PR status was terminated, and her Singapore identity card had to be surrendered to the ICA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The Defendant did not admit to any involvement on his part with regards the cancellation of the Plaintiff’s PR status.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Unfortunately, the loss of her PR status meant that the Plaintiff could not stay on in Singapore especially if the Defendant did not sponsor her. With divorce proceedings underway in Indonesia, it is unlikely that the Defendant would act as her sponsor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     With an uncertain immigration status, and a marriage marred by violence or abuse; no familial support (like the wife in <b><em>ABZ v AYZ), it</em></b> is understandable why the Plaintiff wanted to stay on in Jakarta with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Primary caregiver’s wishes to be considered</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Plaintiff’s wish to have the children returned to Jakarta is reasonable given the matters above and the findings I made. The Plaintiff had been abused by the Defendant and she should be in her home country with her support network. She lost her PR status in Singapore. There would not be an opportunity for her to stay in Singapore for the long term. The Plaintiff does not have any family members in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The parties’ relationship was unstable due to the Defendant’s violence and behavior, and I refer to the few descriptions of the violence and abuse suffered by the Plaintiff which unfortunately spilled over to the older child. The younger children should also not be triangulated in the conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The final straw was the incident on 29 September 2022. The Defendant had raised his hand to hit the Plaintiff, and this was witnessed by the Plaintiff’s father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> As her father, the Plaintiff’s father was protective of her and the children. With the backing of her family, the Plaintiff took the step to protect the children and herself by staying on in Jakarta.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Given the circumstances and the factual matrix of this case, I find that it is more likely than not that greater harm would be suffered by the Plaintiff and the children if the children are not allowed to relocate. It is in the best interests of these young children to relocate to Jakarta to be reunited with their mother, the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Defendant claimed that the children repeatedly expressed their wish to return to Singapore when they were in Jakarta with the Plaintiff. He submitted that Singapore was their home since birth, they had been displaced from their home and placed in an unfamiliar environment, taken away from their father and their grandparents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The Court in <b><em>WRT v WRU</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30720-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 38</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> has highlighted at [38] that although the child(ren)’s wishes are “<em>relevant, they are not determinative</em>”. Further, the age of the child(ren) is an important factor in the Court’s consideration of their wishes. The younger the child(ren), the less appropriate it was for the Court to rely on any expression of interest for or against relocation as they do not have the requisite maturity to make decisions on such major issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     At ages between 3 to 7 years old, the children would not fully understand the weight of what was said to them and by them, prompted by the Defendant and recorded by the Defendant. I agreed with the legal principle that the children’s wishes should be considered but they had to be also considered taking into account their ages and the fact that the Defendant had a strong controlling personality eg the Defendant could be heard asking leading questions in the recordings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     Given their ages, they would easily re-adapt to being home in Jakarta with their primary caregiver. I refer to <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24079-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 9</a> in which Ong J, as she then was, held the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">55    This was not a case where a child and her family have lived in Singapore for many years with strong ties to Singapore, or at least ties which are not merely transient. It is perfectly reasonable for a family desiring to live in Singapore to set up a home here, but the intentions of parties would no longer be the same after their relationship has broken down. In the present case, disallowing relocation was in effect compelling the Mother to live permanently or indefinitely in a country which was not her home, and a country where her immigration status was tenuous and uncertain. In this regard, the Father argued that the Mother’s wishes should not be taken into account as it is the child’s welfare that should be the court’s concern. However, I was of the view that to wholly disregard the life circumstances that the primary carer will be confronted with was simply out of touch with the realities of life and was also inconsistent with the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    The Father submitted that the UK would now be a “brand new environment” for C, but it appears that C had spent some time in the UK when he was younger, and to some extent, had a life planned out for him in the UK before the relationship breakdown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">57    The DJ was also not wrong to find that C was young and adaptable, and would be able to settle down in the UK with a loving parent by his side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     In fact, the children have expressed that they did not want to be away from the Plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Well-settledness and country of birth</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     As for the Defendant’s claim that the children would be returning to the country of their births, this “status quo” was displaced with the children living in Jakarta with the Defendant’s consent, from 29 September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    As set out in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life. The relevant extracts are set out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[51]  whether a child is well settled in Singapore is a relevant factor that should be given appropriate weight. It was also important, however, to bear in mind that in a globalised world, families are geographically mobile and adaptable, and the weight to be placed on well-settledness will depend on other related circumstances including how many years the child has lived in that country, the age of the child, and whether that country has been the family’s home for many years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[52]  Well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[54]  The argument of well-settledness, in protracted litigation proceedings, will tend to favour the party objecting to relocation: the longer the child is kept in Singapore, the more well settled he is likely to be in the country. In some situations, a party who prolongs proceedings may thereby seek to benefit from that contrivance by advancing the argument that the child is now well settled in Singapore and thus should not be relocated. The court should give appropriate consideration and weight to this factor of well-settledness in the context of other relevant factors and overall setting of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I could not agree to a submission of the children having a routine or being well-settled from 31 October 2023. Their abduction from Jakarta on 31 October 2023 was an act engineered by the Defendant. He had abducted the children on 31 October 2023 but took some 4-5 months to file his affidavit in reply and/or his cross application. He should not benefit from this delaying tactic to secure a litigation advantage at the expense of the children’s welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    As for Singapore being the children’s home country, I had tied the children’s home to being with their primary caregiver, their mother. The Plaintiff had tried to maintain the marriage but the Defendant’s conduct caused the breakdown of the marriage. The children should not be deprived of their relationship with their primary caregiver especially given the facts of this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I had made a finding that the Defendant was/is not the children primary caregiver and his anger management issues would be detrimental to the children in the long run. He has also shown that he had no qualms in bad-mouthing the Plaintiff to the children and he had embarked on a campaign since their return to stop her contact with them. This was not acceptable given their young ages and that she was/is their primary caregiver. As such, as set out in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a>, there must be appropriate consideration and weight to the factor of well-settledness or return to home county in the context of other relevant factors and overall setting of the case. The relevant factors here do not support a contention that the children should remain in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Loss of parental relationship and claims of alienation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Parties both claimed that the other would alienate or have alienated the children from him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    On the Plaintiff’s part, I am satisfied that she would not alienate the children from the Defendant and there would not be a loss in their relationship. She had involved the Defendant in the children’s lives in Jakarta from September 2022 and the fact that he had spent so much time with them when they were there speaks for itself. His contact with the children was not controlled or fettered in anyway. The Plaintiff has also come up with a generous access plan and this was endorsed on 12 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    On the other hand, when the Defendant’s abducted the children from Jakarta to Singapore, he had been uncooperative regarding the information between the Plaintiff and the children. He had imposed conditions and he had controlled the video/telephone calls. Given the way he had even rejected proposals for the Plaintiff to see the children in supervised setting by the government agencies, I am not confident that he would ensure contact between the Plaintiff and the children if the children remained in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Whilst loss of relationship is an important consideration, it is inevitable as a consequence of family breakdown. The Plaintiff has shown that she supported contact between the Defendant and the children in the 13 months they lived in Jakarta. The Defendant has also shown that he has the financial means and flexibility to travel to Jakarta and/or to relocate there as well. The uniqueness in this case is that one did not need to conjecture about a relocation plan and access because past actions and conduct showed that the Plaintiff supported the Defendant’s access with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    Given the facts of this case and the matters I have set out, I therefore granted the Plaintiff’s application and allowed the relocation. I also endorsed the access plans presented by the Plaintiff as they are fair and reasonable; her past conduct during the 13 months showed that she would fulfil her end of the bargain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    I also awarded costs to the Plaintiff fixed at $8,000 and disbursements as drawn.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p

The husband is 53 years of age and a Managing Director of a global logistics company. He is a German citizen. The wife is 46 years old and a Singaporean. There was dispute as to her employment status. While she worked in various capacities prior to her marriage, it was her position that she was asked by her husband to be a homemaker upon marriage. She claimed to have only taken on various ad hoc or part-time work over short periods of time. She claimed therefore that she was not earning a regular nor consistent amount of income. The husband pointed to various work engagements that she had taken on especially as a real estate agent. He was of the view that she was earning more than she was willing to declare and that she had the capacity to work as she holds a degree in business administration and had experience and skills to support the family if she wanted to. One of the key concerns in this case was the wife’s challenges with mental health and its impact on her ability to work and parent effectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The couple have 3 children. The eldest child is a child of the wife from a previous relationship. The husband embraced the child as a child of the family on marrying the plaintiff in 2006. The child was formally adopted in September 2006. He is currently a polytechnic student. There are 2 biological children from the marriage, a son who is 17 years of age and pursuing post-secondary education at the Institute of Technical Education and a daughter who is 9 and in primary 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties resided in a 5-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat (matrimonial flat) until 2014 when they rented a terrace house for more space to accommodate the growing needs of the family. The husband claimed that the wife wanted a rather more luxurious life and that this move was initiated largely on that account. The matrimonial flat was rented out for between $3,000 - $4,000 every month. The wife received the rental income which she would then transfer into a joint account held by the couple after keeping a sum of $500 for her allowance. The money was then used to pay for the rent of the terrace house they moved into. Given that the rent for the house was between $5,000 and $5,500 monthly, the additional amount was paid for by the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It was the husband’s position that the monies in the joint account was being used by the wife for unnecessary expenses and without proper accounting. He chose to stop depositing his salary into their joint account and the wife responded by keeping the rental income in her sole account from January 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial assets and the appropriate approach to its division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The power of a court to divide matrimonial assets when or subsequent to a grant of judgment of divorce is found in s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (1961). The division, taking into account the non-exhaustive factors found in s 112(2) of the Charter, is to be in proportions which a court deems just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       A matrimonial asset is defined in s 112(10) to mean any asset acquired <em>before the marriage</em> by one party or both parties to the marriage either ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more their children while the parties are residing together for certain purposes, <em>or</em> which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage. A matrimonial asset also refers to any asset of any nature acquired <em>during the marriage</em> by one or both parties. The section also addresses the nature of gifts acquired by one or both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Other than the estimated values of the matrimonial flat and the Malaysian property and different positions on the ownership of a family car, the parties were largely in agreement on the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For the matrimonial flat the husband provided an estimate of $750,000 based on listings on a website known as <em>property guru</em> a month after the IJ was granted. The wife provided an initial estimate of $840,000 based on information that existed prior to the grant of IJ but in her subsequent affidavit she provided an estimate of between $790,000 - $840,000, taken from the HDB <em>InfoWeb</em> resale flat prices enquiry.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> I took the average of the highest estimates provided by the parties for the matrimonial flat given that the sources relied on were reliable. The estimate provided by the husband for the Malaysian property however was in my view a more accurate estimate as the wife seemed to rely on rather casual conversations with a real estate agent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. She also did not know of the outstanding loan for this property as her husband financed the same as he did the matrimonial flat, the latter from his CPF funds. The Malaysian property had a negative equity value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Although the wife referred to a BMW family car as a joint asset, this was registered under the husband’s name and paid for by him though driven principally by the wife. Separately, the husband was provided with a vehicle by the company he worked for. The BMW driven by the wife was sold and proceeds should appropriately be reflected as part of the husband’s assets and not a jointly held asset. The wife had lost her driving licence in 2022 arising from road traffic related offences including a drink driving conviction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I removed from the pool of assets, 2 bank accounts the wife held jointly with her eldest son and with her daughter, respectively. The first was a POSB Kids account with a relatively modest sum of $28.05. This account was used to meet the son’s expenses. The second is a Child Development Account (CDA) she held with her daughter, and which contained $19,511.81. This account can only be used for fixed purposes largely related to the daughter’s education and any unused amount will be transferred to the daughter’s post-secondary education account on her turning 12 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Parties in their submissions confirmed that the various insurance policies would not be part of the pool of assets. These policies do not offer any value if surrendered, were paid for by the husband solely and continued coverage would benefit the named beneficiaries. Three policies were for the eldest child, four policies were taken out for the second child and three for the youngest child. There were payments made by the husband for fire insurance, family travel and cord blood storage facilities. The husband had six policies while the wife had two health policies amounting to about $3,426 a year ($285.50 a month) and a critical illness plan which had a monthly premium of $92.20. As these payments were made from the couple’s joint account, this was taken into consideration when the division of matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance were considered and determined.<span

The counsel for the wife argued that this case involved a long marriage where the wife was largely a homemaker although she may have taken part-time assignments. He argued for the application of the approach in <b><em>TNL</em></b> v <b><em>TNK and another appeal</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20026-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 15</a> where mutual respect for spousal contributions in both economic and homemaking spheres was urged and the court was in “general agreement” towards an equal division in long single-income marriages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> While the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL</em> defined single income marriages as marriages where one spouse is the sole income earner and the other plays the role of homemaker, counsel highlighted various authorities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that adopt this definition to effectively mean marriages where one spouse takes on the primary responsibility for the financial needs of the family while the other takes on the primary role of homemaker. I agreed with counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In this case, when the husband pointed out that his wife had been employed in the past and was significantly involved in real estate work as an agent on an ad hoc/part-time capacity, she confirmed that she did indeed work but never had any consistent pattern of work or income. Her bank balances showed large enough amounts to certainly question her position but the evidence pointing to any regular income was not scant. It appeared that she was well provided for by her husband and/or was able to obtain good income from certain assignments, likely in the real estate arena.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the evidence, the dichotomy between the primary breadwinner and primary homemaker was evident during this marriage, regardless of the positions that each took on the reasons why the wife stayed at home. It is well in keeping with the spirit of <em>TNL</em> and I approached the task of division with the principles of <em>TNL</em> in mind. Having said that however, the facts presented in this case required a more cautious approach. Being at home does not make one a homemaker. The latter requires active and often, constant engagement with the numerous aspects of family life ranging from household chores to the management of children, their needs and their schedules. Additionally, often in relatively long marriages, the nature of engagement at home may change either because children may not require the same level of support throughout the time of the marriage or circumstances such as poor health prevent full participation, as was seen in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of the matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The wife who appeals against my orders had in her affidavit sought a transfer of the husband’s share, interest and title in the matrimonial flat free from encumbrances and without any refund of his CPF monies. She additionally sought that the Malaysian property and all other assets be divided equitably.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In her skeletal submissions however, her counsel sought on the basis of <em>TNL</em> and various cases where the marriage was “moderately long” of between 15-18 years, a division of 35-40% of the matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It went on to additionally seek the transfer of the matrimonial flat to the wife, free from encumbrances and without refund of the husband’s CPF monies. I found these requests to be at odds. If the interests of the husband in the matrimonial flat were transferred to the wife free from encumbrances and without any refund of his CPF monies, she essentially would be getting a lot more than the 35-40% of the matrimonial assets. A 40% share of the net value of <em>all</em> the matrimonial assets based on the tables above, would be $498,098.91. An entitlement to the HDB flat by way of a transfer without having to pay any consideration, however, provides her with $643,730.75 which is more than 50% of the net value of matrimonial assets. This is not in keeping even with the approach in <em>TNL</em> which leans toward an equal division in long marriages. Regardless, I agreed with the approach submitted by the wife’s counsel but gave it effect as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A 25% share of the net value of the matrimonial flat which in real terms would be approximately <b>$160, 682.69</b> (based on 25 % of $642, 730.75 which is the net value after deducting the outstanding loan of $152,269.25 from the estimate sale price of $795,000);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Her ability to retain her significant pool of solely held assets totalling <b>$376, 511.17</b>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Half of the amounts in 2 joint accounts with her husband (DBS and Maybank) totalling a modest <b>$262.60</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The orders above give the wife a total of <b>$537,456.46</b> which is effectively <b>43.16%</b> of the net value of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While the husband in this case cannot be said to have insisted that the wife stay home, it appears that the healthy income the husband was drawing and the move from Shanghai to Singapore with the eldest child allowed and/or necessitated the wife to continue to be present for the family on arriving in Singapore. The birth of their second and third children in 2007 and 2015 respectively would have meant a high degree of involvement with their care during infancy and young childhood, even with the assistance of helpers. I also did not doubt that she was present for them in routine matters like parent-teacher meetings and involved herself in their school and enrichment activities especially, in the early part of her sons’ childhood. Her acumen in handling renovation works, managing the helpers, sourcing and managing the tenants at the matrimonial flat should be given due credit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Her work as a real estate agent at least till 2018 shows a certain strength and perseverance and would have assisted in some of the expenses of the family. Her continued desire to improve her skills is also evident when she obtained certification as a fitness instructor in 2020 and certification in digital marketing in 2021. At the same time, I did not think that her engagement at home was as involved as she made it out to be through the entire course of the marriage. This can be attributable to her mental health concerns. Additionally, a significant part of what she said were her indirect contributions related to the fact of pregnancy and having delivered her daughter in 2015 after what must have been a very traumatic period when her third pregnancy ended in a still birth in 2014. It is in my view rather dangerous to look at having children in and of itself as a contribution which should in some way be considered and even compensated. The trials and trauma often associated with childbearing and a challenging delivery process are certainly not to be minimised but in the context of assessing relevant contributions, I was mindful not to give it undue weight. Parenting is the focus rather more than having children. Notwithstanding, I was of the view that the contributions of the wife in the larger context of a marriage that lasted a little more than 17 years made a ballpark share of 40% of the assets, a fair one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Moving beyond a 40 % share is not unusual if there are factors which warrant an uplift.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> What stood out in the case before me and is of considerable concern is the mental health challenges faced by the wife which appear to have impeded her ability to contribute to her maximum capacity, even if she had wanted to. She spoke of how she has Thalassaemia, Adjustment Disorder for which she first sought treatment in 2011, post-natal depression in 2014, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in 2020 and for which she still seeks treatment, alcohol dependency for which she is receiving help to overcome and cervical spondylosis diagnosed in 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> While clearly the physical ailments are not of a nature that would disable her from being active and productive, the MDD and alcohol dependency are of concern. The path to recovery takes time and a lot of effort. Any dramatic changes such as divorce and what it means from a financial and emotional standpoint needs to be appreciated. It is of course not the task of a court to attempt to assist this path of recovery by overstating what she should receive by way a division of assets. However, the pool of assets had to be distributed in a way that recognised the need for her to find accommodation of her own after more than 17 years of being largely supported by her husband who was well placed in his employment and could provide substantially for the family. She cannot be expected to simply overcome her mental health challenges and even with the best of efforts, it does take time and resolve. At the same time, I did not see it fair to place an unnecessary burden on the husband by imposing a responsibility to provide monthly maintenance for the long term or a lump sum amount to cater for her circumstances especially given my orders on the care and control of the children which I shall elaborate on further. I chose instead to afford a more generous division of the assets to allow a fair recognition of the past and adequate provision for the wife’s future. Section 112 (2) (h) of the Charter allows factors under s 114 to be taken into account insofar as those factors are relevant. The wife’s financial needs for the foreseeable future given her mental health challenges and the standard of living she was used to are factors that I felt necessary to bring into play.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Care and Control of the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Parties agreed to have joint custody of the children but contested care and control of them. I accepted that the father was better placed to care for the children at this time and was of the view that any effort to place them in the care of their mother would compromise their interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It was the father’s position that the children were traumatised by their mother who was often violent when under the influence alcohol.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> He also claimed that she spent most of her time in her bedroom and the chores were done by the domestic helpers while he attended to most of the needs of the children. The wife’s version was diametrically opposed. One of the key concerns was also the care of the third child. As a young daughter, the mother felt that she would benefit from being in her care more so than the boys who were closing in on adulthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even as mental health concerns do not necessarily hinder parents from parenting effectively, much depends on the nature and degree of difficulty. The impact on children may also vary. I spoke with the children together with a psychologist from the counselling and psychological services (CAPs) unit of the family justice courts to understand better what they felt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The psychologist had a few minutes with the children before I spoke with them to ensure they were comfortable meeting with me.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> My meeting with them was both helpful and sealed my view and the need to have the father care for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is without doubt that these children are loved by their parents. It is equally without doubt that the children love their parents. However, the mother’s current lack of ability to effectively parent the children due to her struggles with depression and excessive alcohol consumption requires a better plan of care at least for the immediate future. I accepted the position of the father that the mother spends much time in isolation and most of the caregiving is done by him and the helper(s). I do not have any reason to doubt the children who shared this too.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The boys are at an age (20 and 17, respectively) where the same level of involvement they would have required when they were younger is no longer needed. Much time is spent in school and with friends. National service is also around the corner for both boys. The eldest will be enlisted after he finishes with his polytechnic education by which time he would be closing in on 21 years of age. Depending on the educational path of the second son, national service is also in the near horizon. The daughter is at an age however, which may require the physical and emotional presence of her mother. Her mother however is not able to meet the needs of her young daughter fully and effectively. I am of the view that placing her in an environment where she would need to continuously witness her mother’s emotional turbulence would compromise her growth and general welfare. I was not confident having heard from all the children, that their mother is in a space currently to put her children first. She would need to stay on course towards recovery before this can happen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The mother presented a letter from her treating doctor at SGH dated 30 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The doctor shared that the mother was on 5 medications which included an antidepressant, a major tranquiliser, 2 sleeping tables and an antihistamine. He believed that with treatment, her depressive symptoms have come under control but that “<em>her prognosis is less than favourable considering her ongoing use of alcohol</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He was of the view that she did not pose any physical harm to the children and there was no evidence to suggest she was not a good parent. Even then, the doctor shared concerns about her use of alcohol for which she attends Alcoholic Anonymous and obtains guidance and treatment from the National Additions Management Services (NAMS). I did not disagree with the position that she poses no physical threat to the children even though her husband stated that there were times when she was violent. What I was deeply concerned about was the emotional toil that she may be exerting on the children and her lack of ability to provide the sense of stability and peace that her children deserve. Additionally, the 3 children would need to be together under the same roof as the boys offer much help and support to their young sister. It was clear during my conversation with each child separately that they want very much to be together and in the home of their father. Separating them would place considerable stress and emotional harm on them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I was confident of the care the father was providing the children and which the children themselves articulated with ease and honesty. It is hoped that the good care that the father has been providing will enable the children to grow well and embrace various opportunities ahead of them. I see these children as having immense potential if they are free from the worry they all shared about their mother’s wellbeing. It is almost poignant that they expressed a desire to see her because they did not want her to do poorly without them around. Yet it is their mother who is seeking to care for them. The palpable irony of these articulated emotions speak of children wanting to parent the parent. But they are the children. They cannot be the adults. They need the opportunity to achieve their dreams through education, work, and healthy relationships. The orders are meant to give them the conditions to enable this. The orders are not meant to remove their mother from their lives but to allow for a safe space to have the relationship develop in positive ways. I am sure the children want to be with the mother they knew when they were younger and not the person their mother becomes under the volatile combination of alcohol and medication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Despite the brief interaction with the children, I was deeply impressed by them. They were open and mature. They loved their parents in equal measure. They understood that their mother was struggling. The challenges the family has faced has most certainly impacted them but with proper guidance, they have the capacity to move beyond the struggles. I encourage the father to explore ways such as counselling during which time the children can address their emotions openly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Maintenance of children is a joint responsibility placed on parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>The husband did not seek any financial support from the wife should he retain care and control of the children. The wife did not offer any. I made no orders for the wife to provide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the ex-wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     There was an interim maintenance order in place which provided for an amount of $15,315 per month to the wife that included payment for the terrace house they were renting, various household bills and the children’s expenses. The maintenance needed to be re-assessed in the context of changed circumstances especially with regards separate accommodation moving forward and the fact that the children’s expenses were to be handled by the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Section 114 of the Charter provides for a court to order reasonable maintenance for ex-wives with a set of guiding factors for that determination. In her affidavit of assets and means, the wife sought $15,000 per month as maintenance for herself which would be almost 70% of the net monthly income of the husband which stood at approximately $21,507 monthly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The personal expenses of the wife amounting to $6,920 monthly were itemised and kept distinct from household and children’s expenses which stood at $14,048.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Clearly many of the household and children’s expenses such as monthly rent at $5,500 and children’s food and school expenses are no longer relevant. Even if one were to look at personal expenses, many items related to grooming, gym facilities and travel and are not items that could be said to be reasonable for the husband to bear indefinitely. The wife requested in the alternative, a lump sum of maintenance. I did not think this appropriate given the position I took on the care of the children and the need to preserve resources for their immediate needs including accommodation. In fact, the husband had far less in his bank accounts than his wife. I ordered that the wife be provided $2,000 per month instead for a period of 2 years only. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The husband has the sole responsibility of meeting the children’s needs which would likely involve tertiary education expenses for the boys in the foreseeable future. He is 53 years of age and would need to find a clear and consistent balance between meeting his retirement needs, supporting his children and ensuring a roof over their heads given that the matrimonial flat would be sold. There is no extended family support. The wife has her mother and sister in Singapore. In seeking care and control she had also proposed that they live temporarily with her in her mother’s house and spoke of her ability to provide care despite her medical conditions. Yet in her request for maintenance, she spoke of the need to find her own accommodation as her relationship with her mother had its own challenges, be supported on account of her health conditions, and her inability to keep a job that would cater for her expenses. Despite her mental health challenges, she has been able to find work. She can choose to do so and is in a position to focus on work and build on her resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the challenges posed by MDD and excessive alcohol consumption cannot be denied, it would be wrong to enable a lack of resolve in taking focussed and consistent steps towards recovery, by continued reliance on the husband’s provision for the long term. Maintenance cannot be used to support a lifestyle of heavy drinking. She has capacity, experience, educational qualifications and good contacts to take fresh steps to work and support herself. Counsel’s submission that s 114(1)(e) which makes physical and mental disability a relevant consideration in the assessment of maintenance appears to suggest that the mental health concerns of the wife ought to be considered as forms of mental disability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I did not agree. A large part of the current challenge as indicated by her treating doctor is the consumption of alcohol while being treated for MDD. This has not prevented her from functioning well in a work setting and she strongly defended her ability to care for her children. She is not incapacitated. What she does need is continued assistance and time to work through her challenges. She has to take steps to support herself and the lifestyle she wishes to lead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The provision of $2,000 per month for a period of 2 years is to assist her with reasonable expenses over a reasonable period including keeping up with insurance premiums which were previously paid by the husband, while she regains her strength and independence. Free from the need to support her children, she would be able to do so if she exercises that choice. She has sufficient resources as well to carry her through the next few years even if she chooses not to work on a full-time basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The mental health challenges the wife faces has impacted the family adversely. At the same time, the relative strength of the husband and children and their support and love for the wife/mother, speak of a good future. The order on care and control sought to provide opportunity for the children to grow in a healthy environment while maintaining links with their mother. The orders on the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance while largely based on the factors provided by the Charter, sought to provide to each party a reasonable ability to move in a positive direction to build new lives while they continue with their most important role – as parents.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Correspondence dated 11 June 2024 – both counsel were to submit on costs within one week of the orders, if costs were not agreed to.

The Wife is legally aided. She is represented by Ms Pang Peck Ki (“Ms Pang”) who has been assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband, on the other hand, is represented by Ms Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

Ms Pang submitted that costs be fixed at $2500 (all-in) to be paid by the Husband to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for the Husband, he was content to leave the quantum of costs to be decided by the court, though he highlighted that the Wife was not successful in all aspects of the matter in that she did not obtain orders in respect of every item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given that the Wife was successful in that she had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items in her application for discovery and interrogatories, she is entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       However, because the Wife is legally-aided, the provisions of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAAA”), which traces its roots to the New South Wales Legal Assistance Act (1943 – 1947),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> are also relevant to consider. For ease of reference, the relevant provisions are reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Costs</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.—(1)    Where an aided person is entitled to costs in any proceedings to which the aided person is a party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the court must make, in favour of the aided person, such order for costs as the court would have made in favour of a person who is not an aided person; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    where costs follow the event, the aided person is entitled to the same costs as a person who is not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Subsection (1) does not apply to any costs against another aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Where any moneys are recovered by an aided person (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), the aided person is liable to pay to the Director so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    For the purposes of subsection (3), the moneys recovered in respect of costs are deemed to be so much of the total amount so recovered as exceeds the amount (if any) recoverable by the aided person otherwise than as costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Without limiting subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4), “costs” includes —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    counsel’s fees, whether or not the same have been paid;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), are expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or are advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs recovered by the Director under this section include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5)(b) and (c), such costs must be applied, in the first instance, in and towards satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In short, when it comes to the quantum of costs, what s 16(1) of the LAAA provides is that a legally-aided person is to be treated no differently from a litigant who is not legally-aided in the proceedings when it comes to an assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the circumstances, I fix costs at $1650 (all-in). In doing so, I take into account the fact that SUM 1426 was not legally complex as it involved no novel legal arguments. SUM 1426 was also not factually complex given that there were only 4 main items in the Wife’s request for discovery and one main item in the Wife’s request for interrogatories. The written submissions and bundle of authorities filed were also not particularly lengthy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The second question which I must turn my mind to, given that the Wife is legally-aided, is who should the Husband be ordered to pay costs to. As a starting point, it is trite that only a party to the proceeding is entitled to costs. That much is clear from the words of Rule 852(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>When costs to follow the event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">852.—(1)    Subject to the following provisions of this Division, <b>a party is not entitled to recover any costs of or incidental to any proceedings from any other party to the proceedings except under an order of the Court.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Rule 9 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 also provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Construction of references to party, etc., in person</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9.—(1)    In these Rules, for the purposes of any relevant matter or proceeding, unless the context otherwise requires —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    a reference to a person, plaintiff or party who sues or acts in person, to a defendant or party who appears, defends or acts in person, to an appellant or a respondent who appears, who does not or fails to appear or who acts in person, or to a litigant in person includes a reference to…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Two interlinked points may be drawn from the above. First, that the Director of Legal Aid is not, and cannot, be considered a party to the proceedings. Second, and following from this, it cannot be ordered that costs be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. The only exception where money may be directly paid to the Director of Legal Aid is concerning moneys paid into court. This is provided for by Rule 444 of the FJR 2014 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Person to whom payment to be made</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">444.—(1)    Where the party entitled to money in Court is a person in respect of whom a Grant of Aid is or has been in force entitling him to legal aid under the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Cap. 160), payment must be made —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to that party’s solicitor; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if that party is not represented by a solicitor, to the Director of Legal Aid if the Court so orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The payment in paragraph (1) may be made without the need for any authority from the party referred to in that paragraph.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Subject to paragraph (1), payment must be made —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to the party entitled;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    on the party’s written authority, to his solicitor; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    if the Court so orders, to the party’s solicitor without such authority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    This rule applies whether the money in Court has been paid into Court under rule 435 or under the order of the Court or a certificate of the Registrar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The conclusion which I have reached is supported by the wording of s 16 of the LAAA. For example, s 16(3) of the LAAA (see above at [6]) states that Wife is accordingly liable to pay, out of the moneys recovered in the course of the proceedings, “so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs” to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Also relevant is the Legal Aid and Advice Regulations (“LAAR”). Regulation 14 provides what is to be done with moneys payable to aided persons. In particular, Regulation 14(4) states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where in any proceedings to which an aided person is a party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    an order or agreement is made providing for the recovery or preservation of property for the benefit of the aided person and, by virtue of section 22A of the Act, there is a first charge on the property for the benefit of the Fund; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>an order or agreement is made for the payment of costs to the aided person</b>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">the Director may —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    require the aided person to take such proceedings, being proceedings which may be taken under section 5 of the Act, as may be necessary to enforce or give effect to the order or agreement; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)    <b>proceed to enforce any such order or agreement for the payment of money by the issue in his name of such proceedings referred to in sub-paragraph (i) as the Director deems fit in any court, without reference to the aided person, if the aided person fails, refuses or is unable to take</b> those proceedings or the Director is of the opinion that it is reasonable and expedient to do so having regard to the probable cost of proceedings and the likelihood of their being successful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This is the effect of s 16 of the LAAA read with Regulation 14 of the LAAR. Costs should be paid to the legally aided person who is then liable to pay this sum to the Director of Legal Aid. This follows from the proposition that the Director of Legal Aid, who is not a party to the proceedings, is not entitled to costs. In the event that the person who is liable to pay costs does not do so, the Director of Legal Aid may step in and directly enforce the order to pay costs to the legally aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     One might raise the point that there is effectively, no difference between an order to pay costs directly to the Director of Legal Aid, as opposed to an order to pay costs to a party in the proceedings. After all, that sum will, in any case, have to be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. While this is true, it is important to specify <b><em>who</em></b> costs should be paid to – the non-legally aided party could well raise the argument that the order was defective on the ground that a non-party to the proceedings is not entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore order that the Husband pay costs of SUM 1426, fixed at $1650 (all-in) to the Wife. This is to be done by 16 October 2024. I also further order that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum from the Husband, make payment to the Director of Legal Aid as is required under s 16 of the LAAA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Pang and Ms Seetha for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Grant of Aid issued on 27 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (6 June 1956) vol 1 at col 1960 where the Minister for Labour and Welfare, Mr Lim Yew Hock said: “It will therefore be seen that the present system of legal assistance to poor persons is altogether too limited to do more than touch the fringe of the need. The need for an improved legal aid service is long overdue and the Marshall Government can take justifiable pride in introducing this much needed social legislation. The Bill now under consideration indicates the lines along which we might well proceed. There may perhaps be need for modifications or amendments as a result of experience gained over a period, but as to the general proposition that the time is long overdue for a comprehensive legal aid service, there can be little disagreement. Much work and thought has gone into the drafting of the Bill. An officer of the Colonial Legal Service spent several weeks in the Public Solicitor's Office in Sydney, New South Wales, studying the legislation, practice and procedure there, and, in the main, this Bill, based on his recommendations, is an adaptation to local conditions of the New South Wales Legal Assistance Act, 1943-1947”.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-09-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)","title":"XBG v XBH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 81","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32214-SSP.xml","counsel":["Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff","The defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-10-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBG v XBH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBG <em>v</em> XBH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32214-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 81</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">09 September 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff; The defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBG — XBH </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">9 September 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SUM 1204/2024 (“SUM 1204”) was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories.

Given that the Husband had succeeded in obtaining orders in respect of the majority of the items in his application for discovery and interrogatories, he should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There are no reasons to depart from this starting point. Insofar as the Wife appears to take the position that the Husband had delayed proceedings by filing his application for discovery and interrogatories, that is not a tenable argument in the present circumstances. The Family Justice Rules 2014 provide a framework by which discovery and interrogatories should be exchanged between parties on a voluntary basis. If a party is not satisfied with the extent of disclosure and the responses to interrogatories, they are entitled to apply to court. That was what the Husband had done in the present case and there is no suggestion that he had done so to delay proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In any event, a look at the procedural history of SUM 1204 reveals that the Wife must also bear some responsibility in the delay of the hearing of this summons. At the case conference on 28 March 2024, directions were given to the Wife to file her affidavit in reply to SUM 1204 by 3 May 2024. At the subsequent case conference on 9 May 2024, Mr Teo had told the court that the Wife had not filed her reply affidavit. He explained that he was unable to take instructions from the Wife. Apparently, she was travelling and would only return at the end of June.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Mr Teo had also told the court that the Wife had left sometime around the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 2024. As the court had observed at that case conference, it would have been abundantly clear to the Wife that directions had been given to her to file her reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the next case conference on 27 June 2024, the court fixed SUM 1204 for hearing before me in August. The reason for this was because the Husband had applied for legal aid,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and he had informed the court that he was waiting to be assigned a lawyer from the Legal Aid Bureau.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I do not take into account any delays occasioned by the Husband’s application for legal aid in my assessment of costs for SUM 1204. Parties are entitled to apply for legal aid. In such cases, some time may be budgeted for the Legal Aid Bureau to assess the application for legal aid, and for any assigned lawyers to come on board (see s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (2020 Rev Ed); <em>WXQ v WXR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31583-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 35</a>). That was what had been done in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     What is relevant, in my view, is the Wife’s conduct. As I have already noted (above at [6] – [7]), she did not comply with the court’s deadlines to file her reply affidavit to SUM 1204. In addition to this, as I had noted in my grounds of decision on the substantive merits of SUM 1204, the Wife had not only provided insufficient answers to the interrogatories, some of her responses were also provocative, sarcastic and insulting. I reproduce a few examples of what the Wife had said (see <em>XBG v XBH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 65</a> at [41] and [46]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a husband, the Defendant should know better. The Defendant would be a complete failure if he is not aware of what the Plaintiff is working as.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>A. Please state the nature of the Business venture in Vietnam:</b> The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam and the Plaintiff would like to claim losses as a result of being his wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Taking this into account, I fix costs of SUM 1204 at $1100 (all in) which shall be paid by the Wife to the Husband by 30 September 2024. This award of costs not only reflects the Husband’s success in his application, but is also meant to signal that the taking of such adversarial and provocative stances are simply “not acceptable in [our] family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice”: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29578-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dated 28 August 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at paras 7 and 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Certificate under s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act was filed on 16 May 2024 to certify that the Husband had indeed applied for legal aid.

There are two children of the marriage. The Wife is a dance teacher, and the Husband is a Director who also works part-time as a Grab driver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife filed for divorce on 29 July 2022. The matter proceeded on the contested track as parties did not agree on the basis of the divorce. At the hearing of the contested divorce on 11 October 2023, the District Judge who heard the matter dissolved the marriage on the basis that both parties had behaved in such a way that they could not be reasonably expected to live with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The interim judgment was subsequently extracted on 12 October 2023 and parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. In the months that followed, parties took out various applications for discovery and interrogatories.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The two applications for discovery and interrogatories before me are the latest development in the procedural history of this case. SUM 1809/2024 (“SUM 1809”) was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. At the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Mr Oliver Quek (“Mr Quek”) confirmed that the Husband was no longer pursuing SUM 1809, but that his client was still pursuing the issue of costs for that summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I therefore proceeded to hear SUM 2066/2024 (“SUM 2066”) which was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There were seven main items in the Wife’s request for discovery and interrogatories. The Wife wanted the Husband to explain certain deposits and withdrawals that had been made from his bank accounts. Apart from this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to produce documents to support his explanation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to why orders should be made in respect of all the seven items, the Wife gave the same reason: that disclosure was “necessary to determine the [Husband’s] income, assets and expenses”. During the hearing, counsel for the Wife, Ms Pearlyn Yeo (“Ms Yeo”) also clarified that the documents and interrogatories sought were also relevant to the issue of whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is trite that discovery and interrogatories will only be ordered where they are relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. In addition, where interrogatories are concerned, the court is only concerned as to the <b><em>sufficiency</em></b> and not the <b><em>truth</em></b> of the answers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Apart from these well-established principles, in making orders for discovery and interrogatories, one must also bear in mind the applicable principles of law at the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is hornbook law that the court applies a broad-brush approach to the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance: <em>BCB v BCC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0324.xml')\">[2013] 2 SLR 324</a> at [10]; <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> at [23] – [24]; <em>USA v USB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> at [43]; <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10] and [29] – [30]; <em>DBA v DBB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31398-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 12</a> at [40]. The broad-brush approach is used as it “discourages parties from being overly focused on petty details and arguing over every cent”: Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, “From Confrontation to Collaboration: A Decade in Transforming the Family Justice Paradigm” (Keynote Address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 delivered at the Family Conference 2024 on 3 September 2024) at [29].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Therefore, in applying the twin principles of relevance and necessity, it is also apposite to bear in mind the goal of reducing acrimony between the parties and discouraging them from fighting over every single cent. There is little point in the court hearing the ancillary matters adopting an approach aimed at minimising acrimony when parties have been armed and equipped, at the interlocutory stage, to fight tooth and nail over every last cent. The process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as a tool in a forensic accounting exercise in a bid to make the other spouse account for every dollar which had been spent: see <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife’s application in SUM 2066, however, could rightly be characterised as such an exercise in forensic accounting. She wanted the Husband to explain, and provide documents in support of his explanation, in respect of more than a hundred transactions from his bank accounts and Wechat account. Having looked at the sums involved in these transactions, I did not think it necessary for the Husband to have to answer every single one of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That said, I note that the Husband had indeed provided answers to the majority of the interrogatories which the Wife had posed. He provided an explanation for each transaction and given details of the same. There are some transactions, however, which the Husband had declined to provide an explanation on the basis that the court had not granted the Wife leave to ask for these items in either discovery or interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the circumstances, I deem it fit to order that the Husband answer those interrogatories posed by the Wife relating to individual transactions involving:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Sums equal to, or more than $5000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Withdrawals that add up to a sum equal to or more than $5000 over a period of three days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition to answering the interrogatories set out above (at [12]), the Husband shall also disclose any relevant documents in support of his answers to the interrogatories. If he is unable to provide such documents, he should state his explanation on affidavit and provide any relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In addition to the above, it is also ordered that the Husband file his compliance affidavit by 14 October 2024. Costs submissions for both SUM 1809 and 2066 are to be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of 3 pages. This shall be done no later than 20 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Quek and Ms Yeo for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>SUM 490/2024 was the Wife’s application for discovery.

Almost five years later, the couple welcomed their son into their family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband holds Chinese citizenship. He works as a portfolio manager. The Wife, on the other hand, is a Singapore citizen. She works as a teacher.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars provides sparse details as to why the relationship between the parties had broken down. What it does say is that the Husband did not feel love or care from the Wife who would “lash out at him in anger if he does not meet her expectations in his thoughts, speech and action”. This made him feel “lonely in the marriage” and “sometimes anxious” in her presence. Compounding matters were their disagreements on the care of their child and finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       This led to the Husband filing for divorce on 29 March 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 28 July 2023. Parties embarked on the road to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out her application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1769/2024 (“SUM 1769”) against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I heard the matter on 27 August 2024. Both parties were self-represented at that hearing. I reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is trite law that discovery is only ordered where the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25]; <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a> citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband had raised one preliminary objection to the Wife’s application in SUM 1769. He pointed out that the Wife had not given him the opportunity to provide voluntary disclosure as she had not served on him the relevant requests that she was now pursuing in SUM 1769.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On that basis alone, the Husband argued, at the hearing before me, that the Wife’s entire application should be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Indeed, Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 provides that a party seeking discovery must indeed serve their written requests on the respondent:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Before an application under paragraph (1) may be filed, the applicant must serve a written request on the respondent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    seeking discovery of the said document or class of documents, in the relevant Form; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    setting out in respect of each of such document or class</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 63(7) stipulates the conditions that must be met before an application for discovery may be made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    No application under paragraph (1) may be made unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the time specified in paragraph (5) to serve the notice has elapsed, and the respondent has not served such notice;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the time specified in paragraph (6) to provide or make available the document or class of documents that the respondent has notified he is willing to provide discovery of has elapsed, and he has not provided or made available such document or class of documents; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the respondent has notified that he is not willing or not able to provide discovery of the document or class of documents specified in the written request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It appeared to me that some of the requests which the Wife was pursuing in SUM 1769 had indeed been previously sought in her 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery and Interrogatories (“RFDI”) dated 19 March 2024 and 2 May 2024 respectively. However, the manner in which the Wife had framed her requests in SUM 1769 made it difficult to assess whether she was still pursuing discovery in respect of the items previously sought in her previous requests or if she had broadened the scope of discovery that she was asking for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On this basis, I do not think it could be definitively said that the Wife’s entire application was indeed procedurally defective as it did not comply with what was set out in Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. Even accepting that it was indeed procedurally defective, as I had explained to the Husband during the hearing, I was minded to deal with SUM 1769 on its merits given that the application was already before me. Any quarrel the Husband may have about not being served with a voluntary request for RFDIs is something best ventilated in costs submissions for SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to address the documents in respect of which the Wife was seeking orders for discovery which had been set out in her supporting affidavit for SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Item 1 was a request for documents evidencing the Husband’s salary and bonus details during his employment with [X] as well as his income tax statement. The reason for this, according to the Wife, was that the Husband’s salary and bonus details for 2017, 2018 and 2023 were missing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband’s position was that disclosure of these documents were not necessary because he had voluntarily disclosed his IRAS notice of assessment (“NOA”) for 2016 – 2023. The NOA would show his income for the year (including his salary and bonuses). In addition, the Husband also points out that his December 2023 payslip does state his net pay for the entire year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 1. These documents were relevant and necessary to determining the Husband’s means as well as ascertaining the size of the matrimonial pool of assets. The Husband is to disclose documents evidencing his salary and bonus details during his employment with [X] from May 2017 to August 2018, as well as his income tax statement from IRAS in 2024 showing how much he had earnt by way of salary and bonuses in 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I turn now to the Wife’s request in Item 2. This was a request for the Husband to produce statements from 7 bank accounts which, according to the Wife, belonged to him:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     UOB account ending -37;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Citibank HK account ending -89;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) account ending -33 and -51;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     OCBC account ending -001;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     China Merchant Bank account ending -484;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     UOB US account ending -9-1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Bank of Communication account ending -54.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the UOB account ending -37, it is clear from the statements disclosed by the Husband in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that the Wife was a joint account holder. She should therefore be able to obtain the statements sought. I disallow the request in respect of this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In relation to the Citibank HK account ending -89, the Husband had explained that this bank account was a custodian account of Tiger Brokers. This account was used to hold assets on the Husband’s behalf. The Husband had provided an email from Interactive Brokers, which was Tiger Broker’s clearing broker.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> That email stated that this Citibank account ending -89 was used to hold the Husband’s assets – this included a deposit of HKD 10,000 on 3 January 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Husband had therefore sufficiently explained why he could not produce the bank statements for the Citibank account ending -89. I therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In relation to the ICBC account ending -33 and -51, the Husband had produced a letter from ICBC, addressed to the Family Courts, stating the accounts which he had with ICBC. It is clear from that letter that the two accounts ending -33 and -51 were not in his name. I therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the OCBC account ending -001, the Husband had produced a letter from OCBC stating that the account had been inactive since 17 December 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given that the account was inactive since 2017, I disallow the Wife’s request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the Wife’s request for the China Merchant Bank account ending – 484, the Husband had merely stated that he owned no such account and did not know why the Wife would think that he owned such an account. The Wife, on the other hand, disclosed a screenshot which was allegedly from the Husband’s personal device, showing a transaction from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I have looked at the screenshot produced by the Wife. It shows a transfer of RMB 0.55 to [Y] (last digits -8484). The screenshot suggests that the account ending -8484 is not in the Husband’s name. I will therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As for the UOB US account ending -9-1, the Husband had disclosed a screenshot showing that the latest statement was in July 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> While it is clear that that account had been dormant for some time, it is also clear, from that screenshot, that the Husband is able to produce the statement for July 2019. I therefore order that the Husband disclose the July 2019 statement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for the Bank of Communication account ending -54, the Wife is asking for statements before 27 July 2020 and after 27 July 2023 up to March 2024. The Husband has already provided some 3 years’ worth of statements (from 27 July 2020 to 27 July 2023). I do not think it is necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters that the Husband provide additional disclosure in respect of this account. The statements disclosed would give the Wife a picture of the comings and goings from this account. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request for these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife’s next request in Item 3 was for statements from the Husband’s Paylah, Union Pay, Alipay and WeChat pay accounts from 2015 – March 2024. In addition to this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to provide all “bank account details in China Mainland by using the enquiry function in Union Pay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband objects to this request. He says the Wife had not previously asked for it in either her 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> RFDI. The Husband also points out that he had disclosed past three years’ bank statements for his accounts in China as well as the stored value in his Alipay account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Given that the Husband had indeed provided his bank statements, these statements are not, in my judgment, necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. In determining whether the documents are necessary, the court assesses the importance and relevance of the documents sought and the hardship to the party seeking discovery that is likely to be caused by the non-production of such documents: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [24] citing <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [26]. In this vein, I add that there is no need for the Husband to account for every single cent in every single account under his name. The documents which the Husband has disclosed, and which he has been ordered to disclose, should allow the Wife and the court to determine his means and the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I come now to Item 4. This was a request for statements from several trading accounts which were allegedly held in the Husband’s name. The Wife wanted the statements from the time these accounts were opened till March 2024. The Wife’s requests were in relation to the following trading accounts in the Husband’s name:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Futu accounts ending -18 and -30;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Moomoo (Universal) account ending -89;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Moomoo (US) account ending -14;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     UOB Kay Hian Pte Ltd account ending -02;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Tiger Brokers account ending -39;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Interactive Brokers account ending -88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In addition, the Wife also wanted the Husband to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     provide all the bank accounts which had been used to fund these trading accounts;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     confirm and provide documentary evidence in respect of the statements, profit and loss, net value and positions of the financial instruments that the Husband had invested in; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     provide documentary evidence of shares and stocks that the Husband had yet to disclose – this included the name of each stock and share as well as the quantity and value of each individual stock held. If the stock had been disposed of, the Husband was asked to provide the date of disposal as well as the whereabouts of the proceeds received.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband objects to this request on the basis that the Wife did not ask for these statements in her RFDI.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4 for the reasons set out below. The Husband had already provided disclosure of the stocks held in his trading accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He disclosed that he had an account with Interactive Brokers, Tiger Brokers and Moomoo, as well as a Money Market Fund in China. The Wife had sought further disclosure in respect of these accounts – she essentially wanted the Husband to provide all the relevant statements since the opening of the account up till March 2024. Such disclosure was not, in my view, necessary given that the Husband had already provided the account statements up till the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As for the UOB Kay Hian account, the Husband had produced an email thread showing his attempt to get the statements from UOB Kay Hian.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It is clear from the correspondence that as of September 2018, the balance in that account was zero. It is also clear that the Husband had done all he could to produce the statements from this account. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Insofar as the Futu and Moomoo accounts were concerned, the Husband had also furnished correspondence from Moomoo’s customer service to support his explanation that all these accounts had been merged into a single universal account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and that he had already disclosed all the relevant statements. I accept his explanation and disallow the Wife’s request for these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, as for the additional requests that the Wife sought (above at [30]), that too is disallowed. How these accounts were funded would be clear from the bank statements that the Husband has already disclosed. In any event, the Husband also says that he had provided all the bank transfer records related to these stock accounts during the first two rounds of discovery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Insofar as the profit and loss statements as well as the value of the positions held are concerned, that would already be evident from the statements disclosed by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, as to the Wife’s blanket request for the Husband to disclose documentary evidence of the stocks and shares that he had yet to disclose, this was, in my view, a stab in the dark in the hope of striking gold. It is a principle of discovery that there must be <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought do indeed exist: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64] citing <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]). I have not been referred to any such evidence, nor is it apparent to me, from the evidential record, that there is such evidence. There is therefore no basis on which to order discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Item 5 required the Husband to confirm that he had not dissipated matrimonial assets by transferring them to his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This request appears to be framed as an interrogatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In any case, the Husband’s position is that he had already stated that he did not transfer any money to his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item. The request, as framed, was not something that could properly be asked for in discovery. In any event, the Husband had provided an answer to her query – the Wife is well entitled to dispute that answer, but the proper forum to do so is at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Item 6 was a request for the Husband to provide bank statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> According to the Wife, although the Husband had disclosed some bank statements in respect of these accounts, she had a basis for asking for additional statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For example, in relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, there was a large sum of money that had been transferred through that account prior to 2019. The Wife thus wanted the Husband to provide the statements from January 2017 to December 2018. She had produced a screenshot showing two large transfers of USD 38,433.91 and USD 64,511.49 and another similarly large transfer of some USD 30,000 just a few days prior.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I disallow the request in Item 6. The Husband had already disclosed almost three years’ worth of statements. It must be borne in mind that the hearing of the ancillary matters is not an exercise in forensic accounting, nor is it an opportunity to ask the Husband to account for every single cent that had travelled through his accounts over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     That said, in relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, I order the Husband to explain the reasons for this transfer and to (if applicable) state the account to which those sums had been transferred. The Husband shall also provide the relevant documents in support. Given that those were large sums which were being transferred and it is certainly relevant and necessary to know the reasons for those transfers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I shall deal with Items 7 and 8 together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Item 7 was a request for the Husband to provide “one year’s groceries statements”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Item 8 was a request for the Husband to provide documentary proof of the expenses for taking the child on overseas trips.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I disallow the request in Items 7 and 8. If the Husband takes the position that he has spent money on groceries for the household and on taking the child for holidays abroad, then he bears the onus of proving so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Item 9 was a request for the Husband to state the bank name and account number of the account that he had used to fund his trading accounts, and to highlight the records of the relevant deposit and withdrawal of funds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item. The Husband had provided his statements for both his trading and bank accounts. It would be clear from those statements how his trading accounts had been funded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I come now to the Wife’s request for interrogatories. In considering an application for interrogatories, I bear in mind the following two principles. First, that interrogatories are only ordered if they are relevant and necessary to the disposal of matters at the ancillary hearing. Second, the answer which is provided to an interrogatory only needs to be sufficient – the truth of the answer does not concern me: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [6] – [7] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to confirm that the bank statements were accurate and that he had not intentionally omitted any material factual information.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my judgment, it was not necessary for the Husband to answer this interrogatory. It was possible for the Wife to argue, based on the documents that had already been disclosed, whether the bank statements were accurate and whether the Husband had intentionally omitted any material information. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I come now to Item 2. This was a request for the Husband to confirm if he had ever tried to hide matrimonial property for the benefit of his mistress or any other external party of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The interrogatory, as framed, ran the risk of distracting parties from the main issues at the ancillary hearing (<em>ie</em>, the division of assets and maintenance). As I had explained to the Wife during the hearing, this was because there was no mention of adultery by either party as the basis for the divorce. The Wife subsequently clarified that what she wanted to know was whether the Husband had ever transferred assets out of the matrimonial pool and to whom they had been transferred to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The relevance of such an interrogatory is clear – it would have a bearing on the court’s assessment of the size of the matrimonial pool of assets. That said, I do not think that it is necessary for the Husband to answer this interrogatory. The Wife is already in possession of his bank statements as well as documents evidencing his income and statements from his trading accounts. These documents should give her a general picture as to the Husband’s finances and allow her to determine if he had been dissipating assets or hiding assets from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is therefore disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I come now to the Wife’s request in Items 3,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> 4,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> 5,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> 6,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and 7.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> These interrogatories required the Husband to explain various transactions and to provide details of the same (<em>ie</em>, the purpose of the transfer and the recipient).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Although the Husband objects to these interrogatories on the basis that the Wife had not sought them in her previous RFDIs, he had provided answers to all these interrogatories.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I have read the Husband’s answers and deem them to be sufficient answers in that he had set out details of the transfer, either in the explanation provided in the body of his reply affidavit to SUM 1769, or by reference to documents which he had exhibited. The Wife is entitled to dispute the truth of those answers, but this is not the proper forum for the ventilation of such arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I therefore make no order in respect of Items 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     These are the orders which I make:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out at [15] and [24] of this judgment, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his possession, custody or power, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, the Husband shall also explain, on affidavit, the reasons for the transfers made on 6 and 12 April (as shown at Annex H of the Wife’s Affidavit in Support of SUM 1769) and to (if applicable) state the account to which those sums had been transferred. The Husband shall also exhibit the relevant documents in support of his explanation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by 1 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In addition to the above orders, parties are to file their submissions on costs of SUM 1769 by 16 September 2024. This should be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here should be taken as binding the judge hearing the ancillary matters claim, and the time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\"

Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       A wife sought monthly maintenance of $600 from her husband pending the resolution of their divorce. She did so by way of these proceedings, which she commenced in July 2023. Four months later, in October 2023, she sold $300,000 of securities that she owned and transferred $120,000 of the proceeds to her two adult children. She contended that she was unemployed, had to provide for the two adult children, and depended on the financial support of the husband. I declined to grant this application, and the wife has filed an appeal against this decision. I now provide my reasons for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The court in an application for such wife maintenance considers, at the outset, whether the husband had “neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her” (see s 69(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). If so, the court will assess the quantum of maintenance to be paid based on all the circumstances of the case, including the factors enumerated in s 69(4) of the Charter. Further, an application for wife maintenance that is pursued when divorce proceedings between the spouses are ongoing is an order for “interim” maintenance. The focus of such interim maintenance is the “immediate needs and necessities” of the wife. This is because the complete financial resources of the parties would not have been “fully fleshed out or substantiated until all preparations and filings for the ancillary matters have been completed”. Hence, the interim maintenance operates as “tide-over” sums that are temporary in nature and conservative in quantum (see <em>TEQ v TER</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17973-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 119</a> at [20]; see also <em>ARL v ARN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0142.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 142</a> at [32]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Before me, the wife claimed monthly expenses of $5,040.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This sum included generous estimates for food and groceries (which totalled $2,200); apparel and grooming (which totalled $450); travel and entertainment (which totalled $1,270); and an allowance for her parents at $400. The receipts that the wife exhibited in support of these claims revealed a lifestyle of dining at restaurants to the tune of $100–$200 each week and an affinity for tableware that cost up to $552 for set of a food tray and teacups. By the admission of the wife, these expenses were “extravagant for someone in [her] position”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Equally, too, this extravagance sat uneasily with the “tide-over” nature of interim maintenance that was sought in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife contended that she had to support her two adult children, who were pursuing university education in Singapore. But she did not provide any estimate for or breakdown of the amount to which she had to support them. Nor did she dispute that the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. There was little objective evidence that the reasonable expenses of either child exceeded this sum. This left little need for the wife to expend her financial resources on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Still, the wife had, after commencing these proceedings for interim maintenance, transferred $120,000 of her moneys to the two children. Even if she had done so in a bid to support the two children, there was no evidence that the reasonable expenses of the children consumed all or even most of the $120,000. This was especially when the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. With that $120,000, the wife could have supported herself for 200 months based on the monthly maintenance of $600 that she sought in these proceedings. Given the willingness of the wife to give such a large sum to the children when she had little need to do so and when the children had not made any demand for such a sum, it was difficult to see how the wife needed any interim maintenance to tide her through the resolution of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Although the wife was unemployed at the time of these proceedings, she was not without financial resources. By her own estimate, she owned up to $500,000 of securities at least up until October 2023, which was four months after she commenced her claim for interim maintenance. Hence, at least as of the time when these proceedings were commenced, the wife had ample financial resources with which she could have supported herself. On this basis alone, there was no justification to order the husband to provide interim maintenance for the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Even if the wife had sold $300,000 of her securities in October 2023, she continued to own a substantial quantum of securities. Although she had transferred $120,000 of the proceeds from that sale to the children, she would have retained $180,000 of those proceeds. The wife claimed that she had used this balance sum to repay debts but offered scant evidence for or details on those debts. It was thus unclear that the wife lacked the financial resources to maintain herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Ultimately, the touchstone for an assessment of maintenance is that of reasonableness. This inquiry transcended consideration of the parties’ expenses, financial resources, and conduct. On the facts, the wife could reasonably maintain herself with her own financial resources. Further, it was hardly reasonable for her to disenfranchise herself of $120,000, or 200 months of interim maintenance, after commencing these proceedings and when she had no necessity for doing so. It was thus unjustified to have the husband maintain her further.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>WAEIC at pp 11–12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>1NE at p 34.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-08-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)","title":"XCL v XCM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 75","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32108-SSP.xml","counsel":["VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-09-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCL v XCM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCL <em>v</em> XCM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCL — XCM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Divorce proceedings had concluded in 2011. The court had recorded a consent order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Clause 2 of that order provided that the Husband was to pay maintenance of $300 per month for each of the two children. The Wife has now applied <em>vide</em> SUM 1987/2024 (“SUM 1987”) to vary clause 2. To that end, she took out an application for discovery in SUM 2194/2024 (“SUM 2194”) and interrogatories in SUM 2193/2024 (“SUM 2193”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard SUM 2194 and SUM 2193 on 12 August and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that the provisions which govern the Wife’s application for variation of the consent order recorded are found in Part X of the Women’s Charter 1961 (<em>see Nalini d/o Ramachandran v Saseedaran Nair s/o Krishnan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0098.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 98</a> at [14]), the applicable rules that apply to discovery and interrogatories are found in Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. As is stated in Rule 63(2):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Rules 63 to 77 apply to all matters involving ancillary or financial relief, as the case may be, in any proceedings commenced by writ or originating summons under Part X of the Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The purpose of discovery and interrogatories is to ensure that the judge hearing the matter has all the available evidence needed to dispose of the case. In that vein, one must consider the relevance and necessity of the discovery and interrogatories sought, bearing in mind the issues that are likely to arise at the hearing of the substantive matter. Here, it appears from an affidavit which the Wife had filed,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that the main issue in her application for variation is whether there has been a material change in circumstances (see <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19435-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 196</a> at [11] – [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is with this in mind that I now turn to consider the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2194 – Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Item 1 was a request for the breakdown of the Husband’s monthly expenses with an amount for each item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This was, strictly speaking, not a request for the Husband to produce documents. It should have been framed as an interrogatory as opposed to being a request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Leaving this aside, the Wife’s request is indeed relevant to determining whether a variation of the maintenance order is warranted. A breakdown of the Husband’s expenses will go towards showing whether there has been indeed a material change in circumstances that warrant such a variation. I will therefore order that the Husband provide a breakdown of his monthly expenses and provide the relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I turn next to Items 2 and 3 which related to the Husband’s income. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 2: IRAS Notice of Assessment for the past 3 years;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3: Pay slips for the past 6 months</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I accept that these documents are relevant and necessary for the variation proceedings. They would cast light on whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances, such as whether the Husband had experienced a drastic increase in his income, that warranted a variation to the original maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 2 and 3 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I shall next deal with Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 together. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had debts (Item 4);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Court documents related to the Debt Repayment Scheme (Item 5);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Documents from the bank to prove allegedly incurred debts of $13,327.76 (Item 8);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with [J], [SC] Pte Ltd, [A] Pte Limited, [RC] Pte Ltd (Item 9);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with M1, Singtel and Starhub (Item 10);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $21,056.67 under “Hire Purchase” (Item 11);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave (Item 12).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the request in respect of Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. They would allow the Wife to assess whether the Husband indeed had such debts, and in that vein, consider whether may still be worthwhile pursuing her application for a variation of a maintenance order. Should the application proceed to hearing, these documents were certainly relevant and necessary to allowing the judge hearing the matter to determine the true state of the Husband’s financial affairs, and whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this vein, I will also allow the Wife’s request in Item 6 where she sought copies of the Husband’s bank statements for the past 3 months. These statements were, in my judgment, relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Husband’s financial circumstances and thus had a direct bearing on the Wife’s application for an upwards variation in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request in Item 7, which was for documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had been paying his mother a monthly sum as an allowance. The reason for this request was that the Husband had listed his mother as a dependent in the Consultation Form of [D]. Whether the Husband is indeed supporting his mother financially is relevant for the purposes of the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. It would give the court a fuller picture of the Husband’s financial obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s request in Item 7 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2193 – Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     These were the interrogatories as framed by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    State the reasons for incurring $13,327.76 as debts with the various banks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State the reason for engaging the services of 3 telco companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Explain why you had incurred an alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $7000 from the “Government”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $320 from [X] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $1800 from [Y] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The common thread binding these interrogatories is that the Wife wants the Husband to explain the reason for incurring these debts. During the hearing, counsel for the Wife had explained that the Wife wanted to know why the Husband had these debts because she did not want a situation where the Husband incurs debts and shirks his responsibility to provide for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I disallow the Wife’s application for interrogatories. These interrogatories were not, in my judgment, relevant to the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. The Husband’s reasons for incurring the debt were hardly relevant to the issue of whether there had been a material change in circumstances which warranted the upwards variation in the maintenance order that the Wife sought. What was relevant was the extent of the Husband’s financial liabilities, and to that end, I have allowed the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum up, the Wife’s applications in SUM 2194 for discovery is allowed in its entirety. Her application in SUM 2193 for interrogatories is dismissed.

As part of their divorce in 2021, they agreed, among others, that the Defendant was to provide maintenance at $500 for each of their two young daughters (“<b>maintenance amount</b>”). At the material time, the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter was 7 years old (D.O.B: xx April 2014) while the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter was 3 years old (D.O.B.: xx March 2018).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The terms of this agreement were recorded by way of a consent order (“<b>2021 Order</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In January 2024 (i.e., 2½ years later), the Plaintiff applied to vary the 2021 Order in relation to the Defendant’s maintenance of, and access to, their daughters (“<b>Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Following mediation in March 2024, the parties reached a compromise on some of the Plaintiff’s requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       At the hearing before me, the Plaintiff’s requests on the following were to be determined:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Defendant’s monthly maintenance of each daughter <em>be increased</em> from $500 to $2,500 (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> Request</b>”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Defendant is to <em>additionally</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)       Provide $800 annually for each daughter’s “school opening expenses, uniforms and schoolbooks” from 1 December 2024 (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Request</b>”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bear an equal share of the daughters’ “General Practitioner, emergency medical/hospitalisation and dental expenses” that are not covered by existing insurance policies (“<b>3<sup>rd</sup> Request</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff’s grounds for the above requests are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the living and educational expenses of her growing daughters had increased since the 2021 Order was made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, it was highlighted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter had been referred to the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”) for counselling for having suicidal tendencies.

The Plaintiff came to this view because his income was more than $10,000 monthly, excluding commissions and bonuses. Further, after the divorce, the Defendant was able to purchase a condominium (which she believed to be valued minimally at $1.26m) and a “<em>new</em> Mercedes Benz” (which she believed to be valued minimally at $332,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant objected to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Requests.

The Defendant wanted the 3<sup>rd</sup> Request to be phrased such that each party would be required to act expeditiously to make the relevant claims.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, the Defendant also wanted to make clear that there should be no double claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That Paragraph 3.1 of the Order of Court dated 30 September 2021 shall be varied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.1.1  Commencing from 1 January 2024 and thereafter on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of each month, the maintenance which the Defendant shall pay for [the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter] shall increase from S$500.00 per month to $900.00 per month.

In determining whether an application to increase child maintenance is reasonable, it would be appropriate to consider, among others, the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there has been a significant and unexpected increase in the child’s expenses: see e.g., <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<b><em>BZD</em></b>”) at [14]; <em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a> (“<b><em>TOC</em></b>”) at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the proposed increase in maintenance is fair given the parents’ current income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the paying parent can afford to pay the proposed increase in maintenance given his/her level of expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Having set out the applicable principles, I will now apply them to the present case. Given that the Plaintiff had sought to vary the maintenance amount, she bore the burden proving that the requirements in s 73 are met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">No significant increase in the daughters’ expenses since 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ current monthly expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To start, I note that the Plaintiff had sought a staggering five-time increase in the daughters’ maintenance – from <em>$12,000</em> annually<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> to <em>$60,800</em> annually.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><em>Instinctively</em>, such a scale of increase – within a short span of three years from the time of the 2021 Order – appears to be unreasonable. This is especially so given the absence of life-altering events (e.g., the development of a medical condition) during this period of the daughters’ lives. On scrutinising the Plaintiff’s list of the daughters’ expenses, I found several of them to be <em>in fact</em> excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, an appropriate quantification of the daughters’ current expenses is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Daughter (10 years old) – $1,497 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter (6 years old) – $1,029 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>For details of the above quantification, see <b><u>Annex 1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex 2</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ monthly expenses in 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The next step is to consider whether there had been a significant increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order. To do this, it is necessary to determine what such expenses were in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On this, the parties held the following divergent positions:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"42.4515096980604%\"><col width=\"29.8340331933613%\"><col width=\"27.7144571085783%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Monthly expenses in 2021</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1<sup>st</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(7 years old)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(3 years old)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Plaintiff’s case</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,950</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$865</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Defendant’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,697</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,577</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At this juncture, I digress to observe that based on the Defendant’s own case above, maintenance at $500 monthly for each daughter is <em>clearly</em> inadequate given their expenses in 2021. This amount is significantly less than 55.2% which the Defendant claimed should be his share of contribution to his daughters’ maintenance at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I did not find the divergence between the parties’ positions ($1,950 vs $1,697) to be significant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I preferred the Defendant’s position. I noted that the amount of $1,577 is <em>closer</em> (than $865) to the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses. This can explain why the parties had agreed in 2021 that the Defendant was to provide the <em>same</em> amount of monthly maintenance (i.e., $500) for each of their daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Finding</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given the above, I make the following finding:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,497) are lower than those in 2021. This is so based on both the Plaintiff’s case ($1,950) and Defendant’s case ($1,697).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,029) are also lower than those in 2021 (using the Defendant’s figure of $1,577).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to vary the maintenance amount <em>upwards</em> on the ground that there has been an increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance amount is unreasonable given the parties’ current income levels </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I now turn to the issue of whether the maintenance amount is reasonable given the parties’ current income levels. The parties accepted that their share of contribution to their daughters’ maintenance should be in line with their current relative income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s current monthly income</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, I first determined what the Defendant’s current monthly income was. On this, I noted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant’s pay package consisted of (i) fixed monthly salaries as well as (ii) payments under the employee referral scheme and bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between December 2023 to May 2024, the Defendant’s nett average salary was about $10,000 monthly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In February 2024, he received $125,602 in cash bonuses (“<b>Bonus</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Based on the Defendant’s IRAS Notice of Assessment 2021 to 2023, there is no evidence that such bonuses had been issued in these years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Before proceeding further, I wish to address a point raised by the Defendant. He submitted that the Bonus should be disregarded in assessing his income as these were variable and non-guaranteed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I disagree. The Bonus is clearly part of the Defendant’s income and is indicative of his earning capacity: <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [43]. Courts have typically considered a party’s bonuses when making and varying maintenance orders: see e.g., <em>Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0785.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 785</a> at [98]; <em>BZD</em> at [12]. The Charter does not ring-fence a party’s bonuses from being subject to enforcement of maintenance orders: see e.g., s 80 (definitions of “earnings” and “maintenance order”), s 81 to s 88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The real issue is <em>how</em> the Bonus should affect the calibration of the Defendant’s monthly income given that the bonus is variable and non-guaranteed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Plaintiff had approached this issue by simply adding the Bonus to six months of the Defendant’s most recent monthly income (where data was available) and then divided that figure <em>by six months</em>. I am unable to agree with this approach. It ignores the fact that the Bonus was given for <em>12 months</em> of work done in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing how to fairly factor the Bonus into the Defendant’s monthly income, I am of the view that the following is relevant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Between 2020 to February 2022 (i.e., the two-year period when <em>no</em> bonus was declared), the Defendant was working at <em>Bank A</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     From February 2022, he began working at <em>Bank B</em> (his current employer).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Bonus was declared two years later – in February 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the above, one option is to divide the Bonus over the <em>two-year period</em> that the Defendant was at Bank B. This will ensure that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Bonus is considered in computing the Defendant’s monthly nett income,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Address the Defendant’s concerns that future bonuses are variable and non-guaranteed, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Reflect the reality that he had received the Bonus only after two years of working at Bank B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The above approach is consistent with <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [41] to [43].

This assumes that he will continue to work at Bank B. In this regard, I noted that there was no evidence that he was leaving Bank B or would be retrenched.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     At this point, I digress to note that the Defendant’s current monthly income is <em>higher</em> than in 2021 when the 2021 Order was made. Based on his IRAS Notice of Assessment for 2022 ($109,881), the Defendant’s monthly income then was <b>$9,156.75</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Defendant’s current monthly income of $15,233 is <em>66% higher</em> than in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s share of child maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having established that the Defendant’s current monthly income, the next step is to determine what should be his share of child maintenance vis-à-vis the Plaintiff.

To recap, the Defendant’s monthly nett income (inclusive of Bonus) is <b>$15,233</b>. On the other hand, the Plaintiff’s monthly nett income (inclusive of bonuses) from December 2023 to May 2024 is <b>$11,892</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Comparing their nett monthly incomes, the Plaintiff to Defendant nett monthly income ratio should be <b>44</b>:<b>56</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It bears highlighting that the ratio of 44:56 is similar to the parties’ relative monthly income ratio at the time of the 2021 Order.

It is <em>unreasonable</em> to expect the Plaintiff to cover this shortfall – especially when her income is lower than the Defendant’s: s 73 of the Charter. In my view, the shortfall can be addressed by the Defendant paying an additional $400 (rounded up from $348.32) in monthly maintenance for his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Defendant can afford to pay the additional maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The issue now is whether the Defendant could afford to pay this additional maintenance. If the answer is no, then the Plaintiff would have to either (a) come up with the funds to cover the shortfall, or (b) reduce/forgo some of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expense items – e.g., food and groceries, vitamins and supplements for her skin condition, tuition and enrichment classes. The second option will be inconsistent with the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s welfare and interest: s 73.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the Defendant <em>can</em> afford to pay the additional maintenance. According to the Defendant, his current monthly expenses is around $12,747.72 to $13,177.72.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Given that his nett monthly income is $15,233, this means that the Defendant has a <em>monthly surplus of about $2,000</em>. This means that he can afford to pay an additional $400 to maintain his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter and still have savings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     It would be appropriate to order the increase in maintenance to commence from 1 January 2024. This is because many of the documentary evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expenses dated to the start of the year. Furthermore, there had been a serious shortfall since 2021: see [37] and [38] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Assuming that the Defendant had paid the maintenance amount up to the time of the hearing (September), this means that there is a shortfall of $3,600 in maintenance from January to September.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> I decided to give the Defendant until 1 December 2024 to pay the shortfall to the Plaintiff. This four-month grace period should give the Defendant sufficient time to raise these funds. After all, he has a monthly buffer of about $1,600 after paying the additional maintenance. If needed, the Defendant can also cut down on his monthly personal expenses – such as “F&amp;B” ($1,000) and “Networking &amp; Entertainment” ($500). I am confident that the Defendant will not shirk away from his financial responsibility towards his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For the above reasons, I varied the 2021 Order as set out in [9] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Parties are urged to agree on the costs of FC/SUM 85/2024.

Thus, her share of direct financial contributions was 13.2%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I next determined the parties’ ratio of indirect contributions. The Plaintiff became a stay-at-home mother about one year after the marriage. She cared for the children and did the housework, while receiving a sum of $500 from the Defendant monthly. When the children were older, the Defendant wanted the Plaintiff to return to the workforce, which she did in 2011. Notwithstanding that, the Plaintiff continued to do all the housework. The Plaintiff also cared for the Defendant when he was hospitalised.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> As the Plaintiff’s evidence was essentially undisputed, I accepted it. Bearing in mind the Plaintiff’s tremendous indirect contributions as a housewife and even after she started working, I attributed a ratio of 80:20 for indirect contributions in the Plaintiff’s favour.

After deducting the value of the Plaintiff’s assets in her sole name, the balance due to her from the Defendant is $511,080.50. As the Defendant had failed to participate in the proceedings, I took the view that the most effective way to implement the division was for the matrimonial home to be transferred to the Plaintiff, and I so ordered. The value of the matrimonial home is $455,000, which leaves a further balance of $56,080.50 payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, which I also ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not think that this was draconian or unfair to the Defendant. The Defendant has substantial sums in his CPF accounts, which he can use to purchase a property and finance his retirement. He also has substantial investments: see [8] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For completeness, I had doubts on the Plaintiff’s submission that the assets should be divided equally by applying the approach in <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) (which is applicable only to long single-income marriages), given that the Plaintiff worked for a substantial part of the marriage and was earning more than a token sum. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the outcome would not have been significantly different regardless of the approach adopted. It is important to note that the Court in <em>TNL</em> did not <em>mandate</em> equal division in all long single-income marriages; it spoke of a trend where the Courts were <em>inclined towards</em> equal division in such cases. Thus, the High Court in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a> observed at [70]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL v TNK</em> (at [38] to [42]), the courts have been inclined towards equal division in a number of cases involving long Single-Income Marriages. I have observed that in precedents identified by the Court of Appeal in decisions before TNL v TNK (see [42]–[44]) above, the proportion of division in long marriages where there were children tend to be around 35–50%</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The final ratio in this case falls squarely within in this range.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I also observe that because the Defendant did not participate in these proceedings, the Defendant did not file an affidavit of assets and means to disclose all his assets. Thus, there is a possibility that the list of assets above, which was compiled from the documents that the Plaintiff could obtain herself, may not be complete. To be clear, I did <b><u>not</u></b> award an uplift to the Plaintiff’s share on this basis, because I was not addressed on this point, but I mention this to provide further context to show that the division of the known assets is not unfair to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As the Plaintiff will receive a sizeable share of the assets, I declined to order spousal maintenance. The Plaintiff did not appeal against this aspect of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I also ordered costs fixed at $3,000 to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 16 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Written submissions at para 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 12 July 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>AOM at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>AOM at p 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>AOM at p 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>AOM at p 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>AOM at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>AOM at p 21A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>AOM at p 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>AOM at p 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>AOM at p 30.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>AOM at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>AOM at para 18.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure","Family Law – Procedure – Leave to make an interim judgment final"],"date":"2024-08-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1730 of 2022 (Summons No 2463 of 2024)","title":"XCN v XCO","citation":"[2024] SGFC 76","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32087-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff absent and unrepresented","Dharmambal Shanti Jayaram (Dharma Law LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCN v XCO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCN <em>v</em> XCO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32087-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 76</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

That Rule states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    A spouse may make an application to make final an interim judgment pronounced against him —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    without leave, if no application is made under paragraph (1) within the time specified in paragraph (3)(b); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    with leave, in any other case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on 28 March 2023. The ancillary matters were heard on 19 June 2024 and orders were made on 18 July 2024. The court’s orders in relation to the ancillary matters were extracted on 20 July 2024 <em>vide</em> ORC 3202/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant’s lawyers attempted to make the interim judgment final but were directed to seek the leave of court to do so. This is because the interim judgment had been granted based on the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 2463 came up before me for hearing. At the hearing, I had asked counsel for the Defendant, Ms Dharmambal Jayaram (“Ms Jayaram”) if Rule 96(6) stipulated that the leave of court to make the interim judgment final could only be sought after the time period for doing so as set out in the Rules (see Rule 96(1) and Rule 96(3)) had expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Ms Jayaram argued that this should not be the case. This would allow the Plaintiff to weaponise the rules of procedure by refusing to make the interim judgment final. If the interim judgment was not made final, the Defendant could not move on with her life – she could not remarry, and the money that she was entitled to under ORC 3202 could not be paid out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I agreed with Ms Jayaram’s argument. This was an appropriate case in which leave should be granted to the Defendant to make the interim judgment final. The Plaintiff had not participated in the previous hearings. He was absent at the hearing of the Defendant’s application for discovery in SUM 3324.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Further, despite being notified of the hearing dates, the Plaintiff did not participate in the subsequent case conferences,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> or the hearing of the ancillary matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Plaintiff’s conduct suggests that he had decided to not participate in the proceedings. Given this, it was equally likely that he would not take action to make final the interim judgment granted on his Statement of Claim. The result of such inaction would result in the Wife being unable to move on. This was clearly an untenable situation that could not be countenanced. I therefore granted the Defendant leave to make the interim judgment final.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This summons was heard on 23 November 2023 and orders were made.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the Case Conferences held on 3 January 2024, 14 February 2024, 27 March 2024, and 8 of May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the hearing on 19 June 2024 and 18 July 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for payment of fixed sum in monthly instalments should be interpreted to be a maintenance order or an order dividing matrimonial assets","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for monthly instalment payment rendered unworkable due to change in payor’s financial situation","Family law – Maintenance – Variation of maintenance order – Whether the loss of employment income and remarriage amount to a material change of circumstances"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 818 of 2020 (Summons No. 3761 of 2023)","title":"XCJ v XCK","citation":"[2024] SGFC 73","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32085-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Kee Lay Lian and Mr Shawn Teo (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the Plaintiff","Mr Yap Teong Liang (TL Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XCJ v XCK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCJ <em>v</em> XCK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32085-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 73</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

If so, should the Order be made?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Do Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order relate to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, or are they maintenance orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Has the Husband satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify his application to vary Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Can the Husband rely on his present circumstances – including his current employment status and/or remarriage – to vary Order 7(a) of the AM Order, and remove his obligation to pay the Wife maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I will address each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Can the Family Court make the Sale Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this Section, I will set out my views on the nature and scope of the Sale Order sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. In doing so, I will assume <em>arguendo</em> there was some evidential and/or legal basis to vary the AM Order. I will discuss further whether the AM Order should, in fact, be varied in greater detail at [71] to [88] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Husband referred this Court to r 540(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”) and submitted that this rule empowers the Family Court in Singapore to order the sale of immovable property (including those located in a foreign country). According to counsel, all the Husband needs to show is that it is “<em>necessary and expedient</em>” for such an order to be made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the matter, I am unable to agree with counsel’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, the Husband has confused the Family Court’s <em>power</em> to make an order of a certain nature (for eg. the sale of a property) with its <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the matter (or dispute) in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is trite that a court’s power and its jurisdiction refer to different matters – jurisdiction is the court’s “<em>authority, however derived, to hear and determine</em>” a dispute, whereas a court’s power is its “<em>capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party”</em>: see <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0258.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 258</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This is especially important in the present context as the Family Court was exercising its <em>matrimonial jurisdiction</em> when it made the AM Order after the Husband had invoked the Family Court’s jurisdiction by filing divorce proceedings pursuant to the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In hearing SUM 3671, I am also exercising the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear an application to <em>vary</em> the AM Order. Thus, if I am to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, I would be doing so as part of the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Court of Appeal in <em>UDA v UDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> was clear in holding that the Family Court’s power to divide assets “<em>or the sale of any such asset</em>” under s 112, WC operates only between the parties to the marriage and has force only “<em>between the parties</em>”;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> the Family Court cannot, in exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction, make orders against third parties in respect of assets and/or properties held by such third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this regard, the Husband’s reliance on r 540(1), FJR unfortunately misses the point as that is clearly a procedural rule. The Court of Appeal in <em>UDA</em> observed that where the jurisdiction which the party “<em>was advocating for did not exist</em>”, he or she “<em>could not create it by invoking a procedural rule</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In fact, the Husband’s own written submissions referred this Court to the High Court’s decision in <em>Tan Poh Beng v Choo Lee Mei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0163.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 163</a> where the High Court made the following apposite observations (at [19] of its judgment) in respect of O 31, r 1 of the Rules of Court 2014 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> to r 540, FJR):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19 […] The court’s power under both the SCJA and the ROC to order the sale of a property is contingent on there <b>being a substantive legal basis to justify the exercise of that power.

In this regard, it bears noting that both para 2 of the First Schedule and O 31 r 1 refer to the need for a “cause or matter” relating to any land or immovable property […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Rule 540, FJR does not provide the Family Court with an unfettered free-standing power. It can only be invoked against parties who are already within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As such, even if I were to assume that there were reasons justifying the variation of the AM Order, I do not have the power to make the Sale Order in respect of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is not disputed that neither the Husband nor the Wife is an owner of the Brussels Properties. Indeed, Order 1 of the AM Order <em>expressly</em> states that the Brussel Properties are being held by a foreign company, ie. [A] (“A Co”). In his affidavit, the Husband exhibited a company profile search of A Co indicating that the Wife, their daughter (ie. [V]), and one [T], are the administrators and members of A Co’s board.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In other words, if I were to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, a Family Court in Singapore would be effectively ordering a corporate entity in Belgium (ie. A Co) – of whom the Husband is neither an administrator nor board member, and the Wife being only 1 of 3 board members – to sell <em>the corporate entity’s</em> properties located <em>in Belgium</em> because of matrimonial proceedings between the Husband and the Wife in Singapore. I do not find that it is appropriate or proper for this Court to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is especially so given that Prayer 1 of SUM 3761 asks that this Court order the sale of the Brussels Properties “<em>and for the sale proceeds arising from the said sale to be </em><b><em>equally </em></b><em>distributed to the </em><b><em>Defendant and the Plaintiff</em></b> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]”; the Husband is asking this Court to compel A Co (who is not a party to the proceedings) to not only divest itself of its properties, but to also order that the sale proceeds therefrom be paid to the Wife and the Husband directly, despite neither of them being an owner of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During oral submissions, when I queried the Husband’s counsel on the legal effect and/or basis for this Court to order A Co to sell the Brussels Properties, counsel submitted that I could simply order that the Brussels Properties “be sold” and leave it to the Husband, the Wife and/or A Co to “sort out” amongst themselves how such an order would be implemented overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I am again unable to accept the Husband’s counsel’s submission, not least because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Counsel’s submission represented a significant departure from what was sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. Counsel was thus advancing a completely different case from that stated in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and what was written in the Husband’s own affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> without any prior notice given to the Wife (or her counsel) of such a change. This meant that the Wife was deprived of any opportunity to adduce the necessary evidence, or raise the relevant legal challenges, to address this new request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any case, I found such a request to be wholly ambiguous, and what was sought could hardly be called an “order” in the first place. It is unclear to whom is this order for sale directed against, and who is required to comply with it?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the reasons I have set out above, I find that it is not within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear disputes relating to (or make orders against) assets held by a third party, such as A Co. If I were to make an open-ended order for the Brussels Properties to be sold, only the Husband and the Wife would possibly be bound by such an order, yet neither of them is the legal owner of the said Properties which could unilaterally effect the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The uncertainty inherent in such an order would lead to difficulties in <em>enforcing</em> the same since it is not clear who is supposed to do what, in order to comply with a broadly worded order requiring “the sale of the Brussels Properties”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Accordingly, I do not find any legal basis to support the Husband’s application in this regard. Prayer 1 of the SUM 3761 is thus dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I should add that the Husband had referred, in his affidavit, to Orders 4 and 6 of the AM Order as orders which already envisaged the possible sale of the Brussels Properties, and that all he is requesting this Court to do is to intervene by making the Sale Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the presence of Orders 4 and 6 did not assist the Husband at all. If anything, Order 4 made clear that a sale of the Brussels Properties would only occur “<em>in the event that the parties agree</em>” and even then, the proceeds of any such sale would be made available to “<em>shareholders</em>” (and not directly to the Husband).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     These Orders do not justify the Court ordering the sale of the Brussels Properties without both parties’ consent, and certainly not for the vesting of any sale proceeds therefrom in the Husband or the Wife directly. For reasons I would come to below, this Court should be slow to intervene and effectively rewrite the parties’ agreement (as set out in the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Interpretation of the AM Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I will now move on to address the next question – ie. what is the nature of Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order. The parties took opposing positions on this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband argued that this Court should look at the “substance” of these Orders and find that they were “maintenance orders”, whereas the Wife submitted that these were orders which divided the parties’ matrimonial assets (which, for ease of reference, I will refer to as “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The distinction between maintenance orders and division orders is significant in the present case because the legal principles applicable to varying maintenance orders are different from those relating to the variation of division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Both parties accept that maintenance orders may be varied if there has been a material change in the parties’ circumstances: see ss 118 and 119, WC. On the other hand, if the orders in question were division orders, then this Court can only vary them if the Husband could show that the said orders were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM</em>”) at [22] – [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Accordingly, it fell on this Court to interpret/construe Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order in order to determine their nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, the High Court in <em>Seah Kim Seng v Yick Sui Ping</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17865-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 731</a>, made the following instructive observations on the relevance of the parties’ intention when considering the terms of a consent order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the fact that a consent order was recorded means that the intention of the respective parties may be relevant in a broad sense; such intention has to be considered in the light of the compromise required in reaching an agreement and expressed in the consent order. What matters ultimately is the common understanding between the parties. The court cannot ultimately substitute its own agreement in place of what the parties came to…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In <em>WWC v WWD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31395-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 17</a>, this Court had similarly observed that when interpreting consent orders containing terms drafted primarily by the parties (or their solicitors), the court can have regard to principles of contractual interpretation to aid in ascertaining the meaning of the words used in the consent order, being careful to explain that the use of such principles did not equate to the wholesale importation of the law of contract.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It was further observed that primacy should still be accorded to the <em>text</em> and <em>language</em> used in the said order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having considered the evidence, I find that Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order are division orders, and not maintenance orders. I reach this conclusion having regard to both the text and context of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Text of the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I start by addressing Order 3 of the AM Order. This was an order of some import as it referred to the total amount payable by the Husband (ie. EUR 3.9 million) and the manner this sum was to be paid (ie. in equal instalments totalling EUR 32,500 per instalment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the language and text of Order 3 as well as its preamble were clear – the Order expressly stated that the Husband must pay the Wife various amounts “<em>as a liquidation for the marital assets</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Given the express reference to the “<em>liquidation</em>” of the parties’ “<em>marital assets</em>”, I find that the Order could not possibly be read as (or bear the meaning of) an order relating to the payment of spousal <em>maintenance</em> or alimony as suggested by the Husband. It was an order relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s 112 of the WC. Indeed, s 112(5)(g) of the WC expressly allows the Family Court to order one party to pay another party a sum of money, and s 112(6) permits any order for the payment of money to be carried out in instalments. Such an understanding of Order 3 was consistent with both the language of Order 3 and the legal framework under which a division order can be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The language of Order 3a can be juxtaposed against Order 7a of the AM Order where the latter Order expressly provided for the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of EUR 2,000 per month “<em>as monthly maintenance</em>”, which may be increased after 2035 for the Wife “<em>to maintain a substantially similar lifestyle</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The references to “marital assets” (in the preamble of Order 3) and to the aggregate amounts payable (eg. “EUR 2,100,000” and “EUR 1,800,000” in Orders 3a and 3b, respectively) stand in stark contrast to phrases such as “<em>maintenance</em>” and/or the Wife’s “<em>lifestyle</em>” (as used in Order 7a). The parties’ deliberate choice to use different references and phrases demonstrated their understanding of the differences between maintenance orders and division orders, and that they had intended for Order 3 and Order 7 to have different legal effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As regards Order 5, this Order expressly referred to Order 3a and was also intended to be a division order. Put simply, Order 5 related to how the payment obligations in Order 3 would be extinguished with the effect that the debt cannot be claimed against the Husband’s estate upon his death.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Counsel for the Husband submitted that the reference in Order 5 to the existence of an insurance policy reflected the Husband’s attempt to ensure that his family (ie. the Wife and [V]) would be provided for in the event of his death. According to counsel, this could be seen as part of the Husband’s effort to “maintain” his family and was arguably a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I found this argument to be equivocal, at best.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     There was some force in the Wife’s counsel’s rebuttal that the references to an insurance payout could also support the view that the Husband recognised Order 3 as a division order. This is because had Order 3 truly been intended to be a maintenance order, the Husband’s obligation to pay maintenance would have extinguished automatically upon his death as a matter of law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and there would have been no need for him to provide for an insurance payout to prevent the Wife from making a claim for outstanding payments against his estate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     With respect to Orders 8 and 9a, I similarly find that they were not maintenance orders but were orders which are consequential to, or are meant to implement, the other division orders contained in the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Both Orders referred to the Brussels Properties and A Co (which is referred to as the “<em>Company</em>” in the AM Order) and addressed how the parties should regulate their conduct <em>inter se</em> given the Husband’s unique capacity as an <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares held by the parties’ daughter, [V] (an issue which I will address further below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Context and circumstances surrounding the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I next consider the context and circumstances at the time the AM Order was entered into by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As stated above, <em>both</em> parties were legally represented in February 2021 when the AM Order was made. Drafts of the orders were exchanged between both parties’ solicitors (including the parties’ themselves) leading up to finalisation of the draft consent order (which eventually became the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The various drafts and amended versions of the draft consent order, together with the covering emails sent by the parties and/or their solicitors, were exhibited in their respective affidavits filed in these proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> From a perusal of these documents, it was clear that one of the parties’ key concerns was the need to avoid the situation where Order 3 of the initial draft consent order would be classified as an order for “spousal support” thereby attracting tax implications in Belgium according to the Wife’s tax advisors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This concern was made known to the Husband, and it was eventually agreed between the parties that Order 3 would state that it related to the <em>liquidation</em> of the marital assets (or the concept of “<em>liquidation-partage du regime matrimonial</em>” under Belgian law), the latter phrase being inserted into a draft circulated <em>by the Husband</em> himself, in November 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In these proceedings, the Husband argued that the exchange of correspondence – including an alleged internal “explanation” as to how the <em>numerical figures</em> of EUR 2.1 million and EUR 1. 8 million in Order 3a and 3b, respectively, were calculated (written in “[ ]” in the later versions of the draft consent order circulated),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> supported his argument that parties intended for Order 3 to be a form of maintenance payments to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Again, I am unable to agree with the Husband’s argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Instead, I accept the Wife’s submission that the correspondence exchanged demonstrated that the parties had <em>specifically applied their minds</em> to how the draft consent order was to be crafted and that they intended for Order 3 to be a division order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Both parties had agreed that they did not want Order 3 to be deemed by the foreign tax authority as a maintenance (or alimony) order and had made sure that Order 3 was intended to be a division order so as not to attract any tax implications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     It follows that Order 5, which is meant to be read together with Order 3, was intended by the parties to also be part of the division of their marital assets, and not a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Indeed, accepting the Husband’s argument would be to accept that the parties had privately wanted (and understood) Order 3 to be a maintenance order but had intentionally drafted the clause in an obscure (or possibly, duplicitous) manner with the sole purpose to evade foreign tax obligations. This is a very serious claim involving fraud and dishonesty committed on both foreign tax authorities as well as the court. I am not persuaded that the documents submitted evidence the presence of any such conduct and/or intentions between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I thus find that both parties agreed for Orders 3 and 5 to be read and understood as division orders, and that was their intention when the AM Order was made in February 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I next address Orders 8 and 9. In considering the context under which these Orders were made, it is important to appreciate that by the time of the AM Order in February 2021, the Husband had already divested the legal ownership of his shares in A Co (and through that, the Brussels Properties) to [V].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     It was not disputed by both parties and their foreign law experts, that the Husband was and remains a <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares. The <em>usufruct</em> regime under Belgian law is such that the bare legal title/ownership of an asset (ie. the “<em>nue-propriété</em>”) may be vested in one owner while the right to use the property and enjoy the “fruits” of the same (for <em>eg.</em> dividends and income therefrom) are vested in another person (ie. the <em>usufructuary</em>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In the present case, [V] is the owner of the bare legal title, and the Husband is the <em>usufructuary</em>. Both parties’ foreign law experts have referred to Article 3.138 of the Belgian Civil Code, the English translation of which states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Usufruct grants its holder the temporary right to use and enjoy, in a prudent and reasonable manner, a property belonging to the bare-owner, in accordance with the purpose of the property and with the obligation to return it at the end of their right.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I accept the Wife’s expert, Ms C’s, explanation that the <em>usufruct</em> regime does not grant the <em>usufructuary</em> (ie. the Husband) the right to sell/dispose the assets subject to the <em>usufruct</em> (ie. the A Co shares in the present case). Where both the legal owner and the <em>usufructuary</em> agree to sell the asset in question, then the latter may be entitled to claim compensation arising from the loss of his rights, enjoyment and use of the asset (as a result of its disposal). The <em>usufructuary</em>, however, cannot act unilaterally to sell the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that Orders 8 and 9 were intended to be division orders regulating the use of the Brussels Properties and the shareholding of A Co.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     While both these assets are no longer legally owned by the Husband, he remains a <em>usufructuary</em> and has the right to make decisions over the use of A Co shares (and its fruits). This, in turn, necessitated the use of language such as “<em>the Defendant</em> [ie. the Wife] <em>will be allowed by the Plaintiff</em> [ie. the Husband] <b><em>(directly or indirectly)</em></b><em>, to become the tenant of the Brussels Properties…</em> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]” in Order 8. The need to provide for the possible “indirect” authorisation by the Husband arose from the fact that he is no longer the legal owner of the A Co shares, but its <em>usufructuary</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion of Interpretation of the AM Order and its consequence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For the foregoing reasons, I find that Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 were orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets, and <em>not</em> maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     For completeness, the Husband did not raise the existence of any mistake, misrepresentation nor did he claim that the AM Order was procured by fraud. In any case, such a claim would also have been difficult to maintain given that both parties were represented by solicitors at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Accordingly, contrary to his counsel’s submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> the Husband cannot rely on ss 118 or 119, WC as the legal basis to vary Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order; this Court cannot vary these Orders because of an alleged “<em>material change in circumstances</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Instead, the Husband can only rely on s 112(4), WC and must demonstrate that these Orders were “unworkable” or have become “unworkable”, as held by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The AM Order is not unworkable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     At the outset, in considering whether Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 of the AM Order were (or have become) unworkable, I observe that the Husband’s counsel did not include in their written submissions any legal arguments on the issue of unworkability. Presumably, this is because the main plank of the Husband’s case is that he is entitled to rely on alleged material changes in his circumstances to vary the said Orders (which I do not accept, for the reasons set out above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Nevertheless, counsel did indicate, during the hearing of SUM 3761, that they are relying on broadly the same grounds (ie. a change in the Husband’s circumstances) to show that the Orders have become unworkable. I also take into consideration the fact that the Husband’s affidavit did mention (albeit in passing) that the terms of the AM Order were “<em>unworkable</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I am therefore satisfied that was no prejudice being caused to the Wife and/or or that she had been taken by surprise by the Husband’s claim that the AM Orders have become unworkable. Indeed, the Wife’s written submissions specifically addressed the issue of the AM Orders’ unworkability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     That said, having considered the matter, I do not find any of Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 to be unworkable (whether at its inception, or that they have become unworkable due to subsequent events). I therefore see no basis to vary any of these orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     To begin with, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em> was careful to explain that the power under s 112(4), WC does not give a court <em>carte blanche</em> to vary an order and that the power must be exercised only in exceptional situations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal further held as follows (<em>AYM</em> at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    However, even assuming that the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court has not been completely effected or implemented, there still remains the issue as to the <em>grounds</em> on which the court would vary an order already made. <b>In our view, the fundamental importance of finality in the context of the division of matrimonial assets would also apply here</b>. To this end, we are of the view that the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets <em>only</em> where the order was <em>unworkable</em> or <em>has become unworkable</em> (<em>but before</em> it has been fully effected or implemented). We would however, point out, parenthetically, that the courts would not look favourably upon frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of court, which applications would be subject, <em>inter alia</em>, to the appropriate costs orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In the present case, there was nothing in the Husband’s affidavits which suggests that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were unworkable <em>ab initio</em>. In fact, the Husband had complied with those orders in the years following the making of the AM Order, making them clearly workable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> I therefore understood the Husband’s case to be the narrower claim that the AM Order has become unworkable due to subsequent events – ie. his loss of employment and his remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     As regards when new and/or subsequent circumstances can cause a division order to “become unworkable”, the Court of Appeal held that the new circumstances which have emerged since the order must “<em>so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which is radically different from what was originally intended.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78      <em>AYM</em> was a case where a husband whose business had failed, and who claimed that he had been unable to find a job, applied to vary a division order made by consent. The consent order provided for the parties’ matrimonial property to be sold only after 6 years and for the sale proceeds to be distributed between the parties thereafter, with the wife obtaining a larger share. The husband sought orders for the property to be sold within 3 months, and for the sale proceeds to be <em>inter alia</em> divided equally. Both the District Judge and the High Court dismissed the husband’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In upholding the lower courts’ decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the variation of the consent order, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    Turning to the facts of the present appeal, we agree with the Judge’s decision. It is clear, in our view, <b>that the change in circumstances which the Husband prayed in aid fell far short of the radical change in circumstances</b> referred to above (at [25]) and did not amount to the order becoming unworkable. <b>Even if business failure and a loss of income amounted to a “material change in the circumstances” sufficient to justify a variation of an order for maintenance, they did not suffice in the present case to justify the invocation of s 112(4) in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned</b>. It should also be noted that the order concerned was the result of a <em>consent order</em> between the Husband and the Wife (and see generally above at [15]). Indeed, the Husband was, in the final analysis, merely attempting to obtain a further amount because the matrimonial asset concerned was now worth more than what the parties had originally thought (see above at [3]). <b>Such attempts to undermine the finality of orders with regard to the division of matrimonial assets are wholly undesirable as well as unmeritorious and are, indeed, the very antithesis of the rationale underlying such orders in the first place, and aptly demonstrate the dangers of a wide interpretation of s 112(4)</b>. If, indeed, he had suffered a loss of income which amounted to a material change of circumstances, his proper course should have been to seek to vary the order for the payment of maintenance, rather than to seek to reopen the order with regard to the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In my view, the alleged changes in circumstances relied on by the Husband, like those referred to in <em>AYM</em>, fell far short of what was needed to vary a division order made by consent (ie. the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Even if I were to accept that the Husband had lost his employment, and was unable to find a suitable job thereafter, the alleged change in his employment situation was simply not sufficient to justify varying the carefully negotiated division orders set out in AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     To recapitulate, the evidence tendered by the parties showed that they had reached an agreement on the terms of the divorce (and the eventual draft consent order) after a long period of negotiations between the parties and their respective solicitors. This negotiated settlement, which was reached early in the proceedings (before any discovery and/or financial disclosures was ordered), meant that the draft consent order reflected the bargain struck between the parties without the need for either of them to undertake an extensive investigation of each other’s assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It was within this context that the Husband had agreed to provide the Wife with the amounts stated in Order 3 as being <em>inter alia</em> her share of the parties’ overall matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In this regard, Choo J’s observations in the recent decision of <em>WRP v WRQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31044-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 12</a> are apposite:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…Although the idea of sanctity of contract is not applied directly in matrimonial proceedings as if they were commercial enterprises, weight is given to the negotiated settlement of the parties. <u>Much give and take are involved in reaching such settlements, and the court should keep this in mind lest it gives more to the taker by taking more from the giver, contrary to the parties’ intentions</u>…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Put another way, the Husband’s application to vary the AM Order and change the amount payable to the Wife or the period/mode in which payment is to be made to her, is effectively a request for him to rewrite the carefully negotiated agreement between the parties even though it is not clear what was the exact “give-and-take” which the parties had agreed to when they entered into the original settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     As regards the Husband’s remarriage, I find that this is not a valid basis to seek a variation of the AM Order. Indeed, given the Husband’s decision to marry his current wife on 3 May 2021 (which was less than 1 month after the Certificate of Final Judgment was issued on 12 April 2021),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> he would have been fully aware of his legal obligations under the AM Order and cannot rely on his decision to remarry as a basis to re-write the terms of his divorce which was finalised just one month before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Lastly, insofar as the Husband relied on the Wife’s alleged actions arising from the sale of the Swiss property (referred to in Order 2 of the AM Order) or her actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> A Co’s bank account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that these were matters which, at their highest, relate to the parties’ compliance with the AM Order or the <em>enforcement</em> of the AM Order; they were not justifications for its variation. The difference between the enforcement of a court order and the need for its variation was a matter which the Husband clearly understood, having referred to the same in his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In reaching the conclusions above, I have assumed <em>arguendo</em> that the Husband was (and remains) impecunious and/or lacked the ability to draw an income similar to what he was earning in February 2021. This assumption was made to illustrate that even if the Husband’s circumstances had indeed changed (as he had alleged), the AM Order had not become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     However, for the reasons set out at [98] below, I find that the Husband has not sufficiently discharged his burden to prove any alleged change in circumstances to justify a variation of the AM Order on account of alleged unworkability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order 7 of the AM Order should not be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In this Section, I will address whether Order 7a of the AM Order (which both parties accept was meant to be a maintenance order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>) should be varied because of the Husband’s alleged change of circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     In respect of this issue, the Wife submitted that the Husband did not substantiate his claim that there was an alleged change in circumstances given his “[failure] <em>to produce any evidence related to his bank accounts, investments accounts and/or other related information of his financial resources, including how he is funding his own monthly expenses and that of his current wife and child</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I agree with this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In my view, the lack of evidence from the Husband was significant and inimical to his claim that he was (or remains) in dire financial straits. Being the applicant in a variation application, the burden fell on the Husband to prove his inability to meet his maintenance obligation, and he failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I do not agree with his counsel’s argument that the Court must accept that there has been a material change in the Husband’s circumstances simply because it is an allegedly “<em>incontrovertible fact</em>” that the Husband’s income has changed since the time of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Even if I am prepared to accept that the Husband’s:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_a\"></a>(a)     latest of income tax Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2023 shows that he had earned approximately $500,000 that year, as compared to the $2.1 million annual income he had earned in 2021; and/or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_b\"></a>(b)     current affiliation with [NWA Co] was merely on an <em>ad hoc</em> unremunerated basis,</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>that did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the Husband had proved his case that he was unable to meet his maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     As the Husband’s own counsel noted in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> the Court of Appeal in <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<em>BZD</em>”) emphasised that “[i]<em>n examining the question of material change in circumstances, the inquiry is not simply whether there has been any material change per se since the</em> [maintenance order]. <em>The change must be sufficiently material such that it is no longer fair to expect the status quo to remain</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     To ascertain whether it is fair for the Order 7 (or any part thereof) to remain, the Court would have to undertake a proper and holistic assessment of the Husband’s current financial situation to determine whether he can still afford to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In particular, s 114(1), WC expressly provides that when determining the amount of maintenance to be paid to a former wife, the court must have regard to all circumstances of the case including “<em>the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has…</em>”. It follows that when deciding whether to reduce (or, in this case, completely remove) the Wife’s entitlement to spousal maintenance in the AM Order, the Court must similarly consider the Husband’s overall financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I thus agree with the Wife’s submission that “<em>there</em> [was] <em>no evidence to support</em> [the Husband’s] <em>contention that his financial resources have been completely depleted</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> In fact, the Husband did not provide <em>any evidence</em> as to how much money he currently has. Accordingly, I do not find that he has proven that there has been any <em>material</em> change of circumstances which warrants the variation of Order 7 of the AM Order – an order which requires him to pay <em>inter alia</em> EUR 2,000 per month to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In conclusion, I find that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were orders for the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. These Orders (or any part thereof) can only be varied, pursuant to s 112(4) of the WC, if the Husband can demonstrate that they were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable. The Husband has failed to do so, based on the evidence he had submitted in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    It follows that there is no basis for the Court to now delete the aforesaid Orders from the AM Order, or for the Court to make a free-standing order relating to the sale of Brussels Properties and/or to distribute the proceeds therefrom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    With respect to Order 7 of the AM Order, although this was a maintenance order which could be varied pursuant to ss 118 and 119 of the WC, I find that the Husband did not discharge his burden to prove the existence of a material change of circumstances and there is similarly no basis to vary the provision of spousal maintenance stated therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Accordingly, the Husband’s application <em>vide</em>.

There are now two adult children of the marriage namely, <b>B</b> (f) DOB XX June 1997 aged 26 years old (the daughter) and <b>C</b> (m) DOB XX September 2001 aged 22 years old (the son) at the time of the Ancillary Matters hearings but under 21 years of age at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It was submitted at the first Ancillary Matters hearing on 10 March 2023 that as the daughter was an adult, no orders were required to be made for her. However, it was also submitted at the same Ancillary Matters hearing, that the son still required maintenance as he had not yet completed his first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The marriage lasted about 25 years before the Father filed Writ of Divorce on 14 June 2021. Interim Judgement (IJ) was granted on an uncontested basis on 30 November 2021 based on the fact that the Father had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1 filed on 2 November 2021) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Parties to the marriage had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ and the Mother consented to a judgement being granted. The Ancillary Matters were adjourned to Chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       According to the Statement of Claim (SOC), there were 8 Ancillary Matters (AMs) to be decided by me. However, at the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, I noted that the IJ also contained two By Consent provisions regarding joint custody with care and control to the Mother and the Father’s liberal access, including overnight access, to the son as the son was still under 21 years old at the time the IJ was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Therefore, at the AMs hearings, Counsel addressed me on the remaining 6 AMs, which included maintenance for the son in Prayer 7(g) of the SOC under ‘Maintenance for the child of the marriage’. The 6 AMs were dealt with on three hearing dates by Zoom and I delivered my decision to Counsel by Registrar’s Notice (RN) on 27 October 2023 (the AMs Court Order) which included two (not three) ‘By Consent’ provisions on the son’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father then filed a Notice of Appeal (NOA) on 7 November 2023 against the whole of the AMs Court Order save for the Order that no maintenance was payable by the Father to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Following which, the Father also filed SUM 728/2024 on 6 March 2024, primarily seeking to set aside Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order on the ‘By Consent’ provisions. This was based on the case of <b><em>TOC v TOD <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck had held at paragraph 6 of the case that the recourse to any unhappy Party regarding Consent Orders was to apply to have the Consent Order set aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s Appeal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The crux of the Father’s appeal against Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son. This was the Father’s application in Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father has also appealed against my decision regarding Prayer 2 of his application in SUM 728/2024 relating to other Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As the crux of the Father’s appeal relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son, I will deal with this issue first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1 - Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     My orders regarding the maintenance to be paid by the Father for the son were set out in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of my Decision dated 27 October 2023 in the AMs Court Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In Prayer 1 of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, the Father had applied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 1</u>: that the 3 consent orders made by the Learned District Judge, Christine Lee on 27 October 2023 in FC/D 2823/2021 be set aside, namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall pay for the son’s namely, C (m) DOB XX September 2001 now aged 22 years old (“C”)’s education and living expenses until C has completed his first tertiary education in Canada. Such payments are to be arranged directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall also pay for C's return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the university breaks, to also be worked out directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    In addition, if the education and living expenses for C's first tertiary education in Canada exceeds the sum of S$200,000.00 which includes the payment to-date by the Plaintiff in the sum of S$100,667.34, the Plaintiff shall bear the difference until the completion of C's first tertiary education in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     With regard to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order: At the hearing on 15 May 2024, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the thrust of the Father’s application was that there was no consent by the Father to bear the son’s education and living expenses in Canada. There was also no consent from the Father that he would pay for the return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the son’s university breaks. It was submitted that the fault lay squarely on the Father’s previous Counsel<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s Counsel referred to page 258 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was a letter dated 30 October 2023 from the Father’s previous Counsel to the Court at 2 pages. It was submitted that this was written 3 days after my decision in the AMs Court Order, to support their submission that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the instructions or consent from the Father to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I noted that the said letter contained the Father’s previous Counsel’s queries on why I had only taken into account the sum of $99,332.66 as part of the Father’s liabilities in relation to the son’s university education fees and expenses and not the sum of $200,000.00. In response to my query on where it was stated in this letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that their position was that the very conduct of writing the letter was to corroborate the fact that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the Father’s instructions to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 261 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was their letter dated 13 December 2023 to the Father’s previous Counsel, stating in paragraph 2 therein that “<em>We are instructed by our client that he had at no time consented to the 3 orders</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father’s Counsel then referred to page 263 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply in 4 pages dated 20 December 2023. In response to my similar query on where it was stated in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s previous Counsel did not explicitly deny in this reply, that the Father did not consent to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. It was submitted that by not denying, this was equal to admitting<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and that in this letter, the Father’s previous Counsel was merely trying to justify that he had done a good job<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 268 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s reply by email dated 26 February 2024, to his previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, whereby the Father denied that he had consented to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Following which, I was informed that the Father’s previous Counsel then wrote to the Father’s Counsel to ask if he could communicate directly with the Father, to which they said no and there was no further communication with the Father’s previous Counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s Counsel then referred to paragraph 7 of his Written Submissions and submitted that the issue of who was going to pay for the son’s airfare was never stated in any of the Affidavits. I agreed that this issue was raised by me at the AMs hearing as shown at page 31 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit on the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) for the AMs hearings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel submitted that this issue was therefore based on the Father’s previous Counsel’s belief and not on his instructions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was also submitted that when I had raised this question, the Father’s previous Counsel did not ask to stand down the matter to seek the Father’s instructions before consenting to this, as was evident from the NE. It was further submitted that the Father was never told of the frequency of these flights, the costs and whether it would be at economy or other class. The Father’s Counsel submitted that there was no way the Father could have consented by a bare assertion that he would pay for the son’s airfare<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response to my query that it was stated in Clause 2 that the payment for such airfare was to be worked out directly between the Father and the son, the Father’s Counsel submitted that this should have been done before the AMs Court Order was made. The Father’s Counsel submitted that their point was that the Father’s previous Counsel should have checked with the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and that they would also address the separate point that the son should have applied for his own maintenance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother’s Counsel responded that for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order, he had dealt with the Father’s previous Counsel’s 30 October 2023 letter at page 5 of his Written Submissions in paragraph 10(v). The point made in that paragraph was that in the said letter, there was nothing said that the Father did not consent to these Clauses. It was noted that this letter was copied to the Father, so he was fully aware of this letter. The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father did not raise any objection to the letter, and he did not ask his previous Counsel why his previous Counsel did not tell the Court that he did not consent to these Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that in addition to this, when the Father’s previous Counsel replied on 20 December 2023, he did not explicitly deny that the Father had not consented to these Clauses. The Mother’s Counsel referred to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at pages 264/265 for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply of 20 December 2023 and highlighted that at paragraph 9 of the said letter, it was stated therein that there was an agreement that the sum of $200,000.00 should be deducted from the Father’s bank accounts for the son’s education and living expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that nowhere in that 20 December 2023 letter, did the Father’s previous Counsel say that he had acted ultra vires<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. It was further submitted that in paragraph 11 of the same letter, the Father’s previous Counsel explained why he had agreed to Clauses 1 and 2 being made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> and that it was never stated that this was done without the Father’s consent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother’s Counsel also referred to the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 in paragraph 8f at pages 3 &amp; 4 wherein the Father had stated that in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses as stated in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit. However, the Mother’s Counsel pointed out that in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit (his Supporting Affidavit), the Father did not state in that paragraph that his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Father’s Counsel responded that my decision was issued on 27 October 2023 and that immediately, there were emails sent by the Father to his previous Counsel which had not been exhibited because of client/Solicitor privilege. Therefore, it should not be assumed that there was no communication between them until the 20 December 2023 letter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel had nothing else to add.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     With regard to Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order: At the said hearing, I sought clarification from the Father’s Counsel that the Father’s basis for his application in SUM 728/2024 was that he did not consent to Clause 3. However, I pointed out that Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order was not a ‘By Consent clause’ but a Court ordered provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I referred the Father’s Counsel to page 35 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for the NE of the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023 whereby I had made it very clear that there was only two ‘By Consent’ provisions which were for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order only. Furthermore, Clause 3 was an “In addition” and not a ‘By Consent’ clause<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also referred the Father’s Counsel to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at page 36 for the NE of the same AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, from lines 23 to 31, whereby I had made it very clear that Clause 3 was not a ‘By Consent’ provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In response to my query on what was the Father’s basis for his application to set aside Clause 3, the Father’s Counsel sought confirmation that what I was saying was that the words “In addition” did not mean that it was also a ‘By Consent’ clause. I confirmed this and added that if Clause 3 was also a ‘By Consent’ clause, then I would have stated ‘By Consent’ for Clause 3 also<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Mother’s Counsel responded that it was also stated in the Mother’s Reply Affidavit at paragraph 8 that Clause 3 was not a ‘By Consent Order’ but an Order from the Court and this point was reiterated in his Written Submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father’s Counsel then responded that if Clause 3 was not a ‘By Consent Order’, then it would remain the subject matter of the appeal and that he had nothing to add<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2 - Prayer 2 of SUM 728/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The second issue of the Father’s appeal relates to Prayer 2 of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024. Under this Prayer, the Father had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 2:</u> Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s Counsel clarified at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that the Father’s application in Prayer 2 was for an order to be made that the son should make his own maintenance application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father’s Counsel referred to his Written Submissions at page 13 in paragraph 26 regarding the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0020.xml')\">[2014] SGCA 20</a></em></b>, specifically to paragraph 50 of the case wherein it was stated that since the son in that case had already attained 21 years of age, that the son should have personally made an application for maintenance and that the Wife in that case was not in a position to apply for the son’s maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In response to my query regarding paragraph 4 of the Father’s Counsel’s Written Submissions where Counsel had referred to the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 at paragraph 25 wherein the Father himself proposed to set aside the sum of $200,000.00 from the matrimonial pool for the son’s education, the Father’s Counsel’s response was that no one had pointed out to the Court at the time of the AMs hearings, that the son was already above 21 years old<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. This was not the case as I have explained below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father’s Counsel also submitted that paragraph 25 of the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit only referred to where this sum should come out from<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. It was also submitted that the Father was not saying that he would not pay for the son’s maintenance but that he should not solely pay for this as it was the joint responsibility of the Parents. It was also for the son to give evidence as to what his school fees and expenses were and not the Mother. The Father’s Counsel further submitted that the son was not a Party to the divorce proceedings, so this did not change the law on who should make the proper application, supported by Affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 was for the Consent Orders in the AMs Court Order to be set aside. The Father applied in Prayer 1 to set aside Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the AMs Court Order because these were not made By Consent. It was submitted that if the Court however, was of the view that these Clauses were made By Consent, then the matter should end there. Whether the AMs Court Order was appropriate or not, this would be dealt with in another forum. For the son’s maintenance, this Order was made under s.127 of the Women’s Charter, so there was nothing wrong with the Order that was made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father’s Counsel responded that with regard to s.127 of the Women’s Charter on child maintenance, under the Women’s Charter the child is defined as one below 21 years of age. It was submitted that although Clause 3 was not a Consent Order, the requirement that the son should apply for maintenance himself, should also be applicable to this Clause as only the son would know what his expenses were<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Reasons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     With regard to <u>Prayer 1</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 to set aside Clauses 1 and 2 being the two ‘By Consent’ Clauses in the AMs Court Order, I was guided by the cases on Consent Orders set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The first was the case of <b><em>Lee Min Jai v Chau Cheow Koon <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0548.xml')\">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 548</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck held that when considering privately settled terms as to the ancillary matters in divorce proceedings, what the Court had to be alert to, was that one Party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. A Court would interfere with an Order of Court obtained By Consent only on just and equitable grounds. Justice Choo also held that if the previous solicitor had failed in his duty, the Petitioner’s remedy would be against that solicitor and not the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I noted that both Parties were represented by Counsel and at no time did the Father’s previous Counsel indicate that he did not have the authority to agree to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ in the AMs Court Order. In fact, the consent of both Parties was clearly signalled to me when the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ were discussed. This was confirmed at several pages in the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Both Counsel confirmed and agreed that there could be consent provisions in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order as can be seen in the NE exhibited at pages 35 (lines 12 to 24) and page 36 (lines 13 to 21) of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The next case was <b><em>AEF v AEG <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0113.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 113</a></em></b> whereby, in dealing with the issue of Consent Orders, then Judicial Commissioner Lee Khim Shin noted that the Court of Appeal in <b><em>AOO v AON <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGCA 0051.xml')\">[2011] SGCA 51</a></em></b> had cited with approval, a passage which explains that not every failure of full and frank disclosure would justify a Court setting aside an Order. It would only be in cases where the absence of full and frank disclosure had led the Court to make an Order which was substantially different from the Order which it would have made if such disclosure had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, I noted that the Father had stated in the SOC that he was prepared to pay reasonable maintenance for the son. In addition, the Father had stated in paragraph 25 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>In this regard, I want to be fair to C. For the same way as I had paid for our daughter’s education, I believe that both the Defendant and I should use matrimonial assets to support C’s tertiary education. As such, I propose that from the cash portion of the pool of matrimonial assets, we set aside a sum of S$200,000.00 for C’s education….”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In my view, the above statement was confirmed in the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 for SUM 728/2024 in paragraph 6 wherein the Father had responded that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>The [Mother’s] assertion that I agreed to S$200,000.00 is incomplete because, I agreed to the sum of S$200,000.00 to be deducted from the common pool, which means the whole S$200,000.00 can be factored in as a liability under the [Father].</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As such, I would have come to the same decision regarding the Father’s payment in the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education. This was based on my assessment that the Father had agreed to pay for the son’s education and living expenses of the son’s first tertiary education, which was in Canada where the son was already studying at the time of the AMs hearings. I had also noted that it was not disputed at the time of the AMs hearings, that the Father was the sole breadwinner of the family and that the Mother had been a homemaker from the inception of the marriage until the Father commenced the divorce proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I was also of the view that based on the principles set out in the caselaw on By Consent Orders, there were no just and equitable grounds to set aside the two ‘By Consent Clauses’. On the contrary, to do so would be unjust and inequitable to both the son as well as the Mother, as the clauses on the son’s maintenance was one of my considerations in not awarding maintenance to the Mother. This was because I had taken into account the Father’s Fact and Position Sheet filed on 24 February 2023, wherein he had stated that <em>“The [Father] is prepared to pay for the Parties’ son’s university education. However, he humbly requests that this Honourable Court take it into consideration when it determines the division of matrimonial assets and whether maintenance should be awarded to the [Mother].”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Regarding Clause 2 of the AMs Court Order on the payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore, I was of the view that since it was not disputed that the son was already studying in Canada, there should be some provision for the son’s airfare to come home. In response to my query on this issue, the Father’s previous Counsel had informed that the Father was prepared to pay for any incidental expenses incurred for the son’s university education. In my view, it was logical that this should include payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore but, to be fair to the Father, that the specifics for this should be arranged directly between the Father and the son. This can be seen in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024 for the NE of the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 31 in lines 23 to 32, page 32 in lines 1 to 32, page 33 in lines 1 to 3, page 35 in lines 6 to 31 and page 36 in lines 1 to 22.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Finally, I was of the view that the Father’s claim that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ was an afterthought. I noted that all the documents provided by the Father at the hearing of SUM 728/2024 were made after the AMs Court Order was issued on 27 October 2023. The Father did not provide any document which was dated prior to the AMs Court Order, to show that he would not or could not have consented to these two ‘By Consent Clauses’. As such, I was of the view that the Father had failed to discharge the burden of proving that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ and that he was simply relying on assertions that were made after the AMs Court Order was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Regarding Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order, as I had made it very clear at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that this was not a ‘By Consent’ provision, I agree with the Father’s Counsel that Clause 3 should therefore remain the subject matter of the Father’s appeal. I would add that I had made the Orders for the Father to pay for the son’s first tertiary education and living expenses in Canada, on the basis of the Father’s own statements as referred to above, that he would pay the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     However, I did not agree with the Father’s conditions for the payment of the $200,000.00 by him. That was why I did not frame this Clause as a ‘By Consent’ provision. I was also of the view that it was reasonable to make an Order for the Father to bear the difference beyond the agreed sum of $200,000.00 until the completion of the son’s first tertiary education in Canada. This was to ensure that having commenced his first tertiary education in Canada, the son would have the stability of knowing that he would be able to complete his studies. My assessment was that it was within the Father’s financial capacity to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     With regard to <u>Prayer 2</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, I noted that in the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee</em></b>, the son in that case was already over 21 years at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed but in the present case, the son was still 20 years old at the time the Father filed the Writ of Divorce. I also noted that in the SOC filed by the Father, he himself had included the Prayer that he would pay reasonable maintenance for the son. I further noted that when IJ was granted in November 2021, the son was still under 21 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I was aware that the son was over 21 years old at the time of the AMs hearings. In fact, this was noted in paragraph 4 of my Brief Reasons and stated in Clause 1 itself of the AMs Court Order. At the AMs hearings, it was submitted that the Father was agreeable to pay and had continued to pay as maintenance for the son, while the son pursued his first tertiary education in Canada. This can be seen in lines 3 to 26 of the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 25 in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Hence, I was of the view that where both Parents had agreed that the son’s maintenance could be included in the AMs Court Order even though the son was already over 21 years at the time, that this was reasonable and in the best interests of the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I had decided against making an Order under Prayer 2 of SUM 728/2024 that the son should make his own maintenance application, because the law already allows the son to make his own maintenance application from the Father. Therefore, there was no necessity for me to make such an Order as this would appear to be compelling the son to make a maintenance application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I was of the view that even if the Father succeeds in setting aside the ‘By Consent Clauses’ of the AMs Court Order, it is still the son’s choice whether or not the son wishes to make a maintenance application from the Father. As such, I declined to make any Order which would appear to compel the son to make such an application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Accordingly, I delivered my Decision and Brief Reasons orally to Counsel on 15 May 2024 on the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024. I have nothing further to add to my reasons given above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Notes of

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Defendant Husband in this case sought a stay of Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, in favour of Malaysian proceedings commenced by himself. In response, the Plaintiff Wife filed an anti-suit injunction in SUM 56/2024 to injunct the Husband’s divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I held that while Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the divorce proceedings, the threshold to injunct the Malaysian proceedings had not been crossed. I therefore dismissed both applications. The Husband now appeals against my refusal to grant his stay in SUM 3790/2023. For completeness, and due to the common context between both applications, I provide my reasons for both decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both parties are Malaysian citizens. The Husband and Wife were aged 55 years and 41 years at the time of these proceedings. The couple married in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2001, and resided together in Malaysia for the next three years. They moved to Australia in 2004 to 2008, where three children were born to the marriage, a daughter aged 19 years (“A”), and a pair of male and female twins aged 17 years (“I” and “V” respectively). After the birth of the twins, the family moved back to Malaysia in 2008, and then to Singapore within that same year for the sake of the children’s education. In April 2011, the Husband left the family in Singapore and returned to Malaysia by himself to pursue his business interests. He has been based in Malaysia ever since. The Wife is currently employed in Singapore and holds an employment pass. All three children remain Malaysian citizens, although the eldest child (A) obtained Singapore citizenship in September 2022, and the female twin (V) obtained permanent residency in Singapore in February 2021. It is not disputed that the parties’ extended family resides in Malaysia and frequent family trips are taken back home to Malaysia. However, the family as a whole and the children in particular have never resided in Malaysia for any meaningful period of time since 2008.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced these divorce proceedings on 1 August 2023. The Husband has not taken any step in these divorce proceedings since being served on 16 October 2023, save to enter appearance under protest and indicate his intention to stay the action on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. At a case conference on 16 November 2023, the Husband was directed to file his application for a stay by 7 December 2023. The Husband then commenced divorce proceedings in Malaysian on 7 December 2023, and shortly after, filed his application for a stay of the Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on 12 December 2023. The Malaysian divorce proceedings were subsequently served on the Wife on 26 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of this hearing, apart from filing for an anti-suit injunction, the Wife had also applied in Malaysia to set aside the order of service out of jurisdiction obtained by the Husband. She had also sought a stay of the Malaysian proceedings on the basis that it was not a proper forum for the dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The matter came before me for hearing on 19 April 2024. As the Father had not had access to the children and the Wife had not received maintenance since proceedings commenced, I asked parties to consider an adjournment for three sessions of private mediation, which could also afford the Father access to the children over a meal on the days that each mediation session would be held. The Father in addition volunteered to pay $15,000 directly to the children for maintenance when he saw them for access. As parties were agreeable to this proposal, I gave the necessary directions and adjourned the matter for further hearing on 3 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Unfortunately, the mediation did not bear fruit, although the Father did manage to have one session of access with the children to celebrate their birthdays. I accordingly heard the remainder of parties’ submissions on 3 June 2024, and issued my decision on both applications with brief grounds by way of Registry Notice on 11 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The law relating to a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is well documented. The test laid down in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) has been affirmed in numerous local cases, including by our Court of Appeal in <em>CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> at [25] and [26]. The two-stage test is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden is on the defendant to show that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes at this stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate, it will ordinarily refuse a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there is some other available forum which <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of such special circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysia is the more appropriate forum </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Nationality and Habitual Residency of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Both parties were born in Malaysia and have Malaysian citizenship. Neither party is a Singapore citizen or Permanent Resident. The Husband has been domiciled in Malaysia upon his return in 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife and the children have been domiciled in Singapore for 16 years, since 2008. The eldest child (A) has Singapore citizenship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, while the female twin (V) has permanent residency<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although all three children have not given up their Malaysian citizenship. It is undisputed that the Wife and children visit Malaysia regularly to spend time with their relatives<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, I would point out that nationality alone is not the determinative factor in the choice of forum. The focus should instead be on the domicile or habitual residence of the parties. This was highlighted by the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a>, at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>While not entirely discounting nationality as a connecting factor, nationality per se is of limited significance. In an increasingly globalised world, multiple nationalities are becoming the norm. Residency and/or domicile are better indicators of then strength of a party’s connection to a particular forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Counsel for the Husband sought to rely on <em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, a decision of the Family Division of the High Court of England, to justify a stay in favour of the preceding place of domicile of the parties (i.e. Malaysia). In the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, the husband sought a stay of proceedings in the United Kingdom in favour of New York. While both parties were not citizens of either jurisdiction, they had originally resided in New York for a significant period of time prior to the marriage, and had thereafter lived in the United Kingdom for 13 years during the marriage. In particular, the husband had resided in New York for over 20 years and ran his “enormous financial empire” primarily from that location<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Counsel for the Husband therefore sought to draw a parallel between <em>S. v S.</em> and the present case, as the English High Court in <em>S. v S.</em> had agreed to stay English proceedings in favour of New York, which was the domicile of both parties <em>prior</em> to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There was however a clear distinguishing factor in the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, as the parties had executed a pre-nuptial agreement in New York, which provided that the applicable law and forum for any financial dispute should be that of the state of New York. The primacy of this factor over that of the domicile of the parties was clear from the final comments Wilson J’s decision, at page 1215:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the end I have been persuaded that New York is clearly more appropriate than England as a forum for the proceedings for divorce and for the determination of financial issues between the parties. In reaching that conclusion I have borne very much in mind the wife’s primary residence in England; nor, however, have I forgotten her close past links with New York. I have obviously paid considerable regard to the husband’s primary residence, established over many years, in New York. <u>But the provisions of the prenuptial agreement, both the substantive financial provisions and in particular the provisions as to forum, have weighted heavily with me</u>. Even if, which I doubt, this agreement were to be of very limited significance in any substantive analysis by this court of the wife’s financial claims pursuant to section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, it in no way follows that it must be of very limited significance in the despatch of the current application. Fairness requires otherwise. I am also satisfied, for the reasons already given, that substantial justice will be done in New York. Accordingly, the balance of fairness is such that it is appropriate for the proceedings there to be disposed of before further steps are taken in the proceedings here. This conclusion yields me a discretion which I propose to exercise by granting a stay. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Accordingly, I did not agree that the preceding domicile or place of origin of the parties should be the determinative factor as far as the <em>Spiliada</em> test was concerned. In the present case, the focus should be on the <em>present</em> domicile of the parties and the children. Out of 22 years of marriage, the parties have only spent three years in Malaysia as a married couple (from 2001-2004). The Wife has a stronger and more substantial connection to Singapore, having resided here for 16 out of the 23 years of marriage, while the Husband has resided in Malaysia for about 16 years for the duration of the marriage (2001-2004, and 2011-present). The children have also stayed in Singapore for most of their lives. They were born in Australia, and moved to Singapore when they were 3 years and 1 year old respectively. They have been educated here, with their entire social circle found in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. They also have family and cousins in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. As earlier noted, the eldest child (A) has taken up concurrent Singapore nationality, while the female twin (V) is a permanent resident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband further takes the position that parties remain connected to Malaysia and the intention is for the entire family to eventually return to Malaysia after the children complete their education in Singapore, with a view to them taking over the family business<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. I would point out though that the Husband had in the Malaysian court papers asked for the children to stay in Singapore with the Wife after the resolution of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, and there does not appear to be any agreement from the Wife or the children to his long-term plan to return to Malaysia. I also note that the Wife has unsuccessfully applied for permanent residency in Singapore seven times, and her sister and family are also permanent residents and reside in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. I did not think it evident at all that the Wife’s future intentions lay with Malaysia, and in any case, I would not place any significant weight on this point given its speculative nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     With regard to residency, there appears therefore to be an even split in terms of the habitual residency of the Husband and Wife in favour of Malaysia and Singapore respectively, while the residency of the children indisputably lies with Singapore. Whether this latter factor should be given determinative weight in the choice of forum depends on whether child issues will come to the fore in these proceedings. I now turn to this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Child Issues in the Divorce</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In applying the <em>Spiliada</em> test to divorce proceedings, the key question for determination by the court is which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the children (per <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [15]). This view was earlier established in <em>Re A</em> (an infant) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4206-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 60</a>, where Lai Kew Chai J held at [4] that the evaluation of the best interests of the child would require a consideration of which forum could best appreciate their cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances in their upbringing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of the guardianship of a child, and the related issues of custody, care and control, it seemed to me that we had to take into account a host of factors and determine which forum would more effectively evaluate the best interests of the child, in terms of a tribunal’s understanding of and affinity to the cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances relevant to the best way in which the child is to be brought up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     His Honour went on to hold, at [16], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of these proceedings involving the custody of a child, an important consideration must be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum serves. This is self-evident: a child’s best interest is best determined by the forum which is best equipped to determine what is best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Indeed, where custody, care and control are disputed in the divorce, a key factor on which forum is more appropriate is where the children had been raised. In <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, the fact that the children of the marriage were raised in Singapore was a key factor rejecting the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of California (at [20], [21]). Similarly, in <em>TAR v TAS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17691-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 23</a>, the court placed significant weight on the fact that the child of the marriage had lived and been educated in Singapore for the majority of her years. The court then rejected the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of the Nigerian courts, where the child had never resided (at [24],[25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In response, Counsel for the Husband contends that the issues in this divorce pertain mainly to financial matters, and that issues in relation to the children are not likely to be disputed. While I would like to share counsel’s optimism, I note that the Father is asking for care and control of the children in the Malaysian proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife is requesting for care and control in the Singapore proceedings (the Father had not filed pleadings in the Singapore proceedings at the time of this hearing, but in his recently filed Defence and Counterclaim on 11 July 2024, he now requests for <em>joint</em> custody, care and control, which still differs from the Wife’s position). I also note that the parties have not been able to agree on access in recent months. This does not augur well for agreement on child issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In addition, the Husband had stopped paying maintenance since November 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, and it appears that the quantum of child maintenance is likely to be disputed. In this regard, it cannot be assumed that evidence in relation to the children’s welfare, education and upkeep will not be necessary. Nor can it be ruled out that therapeutic and/or forensic interventions may be needed to protect the children’s best interests. I therefore consider that the potential need to litigate on children issues points strongly towards Singapore as the more appropriate and natural forum for the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In the present case, there is also the additional consideration that two of the children have special medical needs requiring long term medical care. Specifically, the eldest child (A) is diagnosed as being autistic and also suffers from Hereditary Angioedema<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, while the male twin (I) suffers from dyslexia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As both children will continue to receive treatment and therapy in Singapore, the cost and nature of which is likely to feature in considerations relating to maintenance, this once more points towards Singapore as the more natural and appropriate forum for resolution of child-related issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Location of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The third factor the Husband submits for consideration is the fact that there are substantial assets in the matrimonial pool located in Malaysia, which would be better dealt with by the Malaysian courts. He points out that the matrimonial assets there include shares in the Husband’s Malaysian Company, as well as two properties in the state of Johor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. He is also a director of ten other companies incorporated in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, the records of which are held in Malaysia and in the Malay language, with the requisite witnesses in Malaysia. Counsel for the Husband seeks to rely on the case of <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 2 SLR(R) 0851.xml')\">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851</a>, where it was held at [34] by the Court of Appeal that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the nationality and place of residence of the parties are relevant, they are not the only factors to be taken into account in deciding whether Singapore is the appropriate forum. The jurisdiction of the court is not based on nationality and residence of the parties alone. Great weight should also be attached to the location of the subject matters in dispute and the undesirability of a Singapore court in deciding issues involving ownership of land in Malaysia. In addition, there may be complexities involved in the enforcement of the trust in Malaysia, should we declare there to be one. In any event, the respondent would be carrying on with the proceedings in Malaysia in relation to the Malaysian lands even if we refuse to grant a stay of proceedings in Singapore and there would inevitably be some duplication of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While the existence of Malaysian assets is a factor in favour of granting a stay, it should be remembered that there are three properties in the Wife’s name in Singapore, for which the Malaysian Court would be similarly ill-equipped to make findings of fact or to enforce orders. There also exist assets in Australia, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Papua New Guinea and Switzerland<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, for which both the Singapore and Malaysian courts are equally well placed to deal with their division. Accordingly, I did not think that either court had a special advantage as far as financial assets are concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Existence of Parallel Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Finally, the Husband submits that greater weight should be placed in favour of Malaysia under the common law doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, i.e. the fact that he has filed parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I note in this regard that the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGCA 50</a>, at [39] had clarified that this doctrine should be considered in light of the general principles applicable to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. In essence, the court should consider the degree to which respective proceedings had advanced, the degree of overlap of issues and parties, whether the litigation called for complex facts which require highly specialised expert evidence and the risk of conflicting judgments arising from conflicting proceedings. The Court of Appeal stressed at [40] that “the existence of parallel proceedings is never wholly dispositive of the issue of the natural forum as a matter of course, but is only a factor to be considered in the application of the <em>Spiliada</em> principles.” It was further noted by then-Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong in <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [57] that “the weight to be given to parallel proceedings would depend on the circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As divorce applications in Singapore and Malaysia are in their infancy, I did not think that the doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> was a significant factor in the present case. Indeed, both applications had not advanced beyond the pleadings stage at the time of this hearing. The risk of duplicitous outcomes or wasted proceedings is remote at this point, and can be avoided should sensible minds prevail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Moreover, I do note that any issue arising from the duplicity of proceedings appears to have been self-inflicted, as it was the Husband who chose to commence divorce proceedings in Malaysia nearly two months <em>after</em> the Singapore proceedings had been served on him. In <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a>, Choo J noted at [11] in regard to the husband’s appeal against an anti-suit injunction restraining him from continuing with New York proceedings, that “it does not lie in the mouth of the husband to rely on the rule against duplicitous proceedings having commenced the action in New York himself.” In this regard, the Wife further contends that there does not appear to be a justifiable rationale for the Husband to continue with the Malaysian proceedings, given that she had on 5 January 2024 provided him a written undertaking that she would consent to judgment in the Malaysian Courts on terms identical to the terms of the final judgment in the Singapore proceedings, if the Husband agreed to suspend the Malaysian proceedings until after the conclusion of the Singapore proceedings. While I will address this issue more fully in the anti-suit injunction below, it would suffice to say for the purposes of the stay application that the infancy of the foreign proceedings and the fact that they are within the control of the applicant undermine his argument that it should be the Singapore courts that should desist to avoid a duplicity of outcomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Having considered the above factors in totality, I placed greater weight on the domicile of the Wife and children, and the need to protect the best interests of the children, as reasons to conclude under the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that Singapore was the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether there are circumstances which would have required a stay to be refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As there was no finding of another more appropriate forum, it was not necessary to address the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test. However, I would observe for completeness that <em>had</em> the factors justified a stay in favour of Malaysian proceedings, there did not seem to me to be any special circumstances that would have militated against such a stay. I note that the Wife is fluent in the Malay language, is presently able to instruct Malaysian counsel, and appears to have the resources to contest divorce proceedings in Malaysia. Accordingly, had the Husband passed the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test before me, he would not have fallen short at its second stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Anti-Suit Injunction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I also set out the reasons for my dismissal of the Wife’s anti-suit injunction in FC/SUM 56/2024. Although the Wife has not appealed against my order, the issues discussed in these part of the proceedings may provide further context to the application for the stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The legal principles relevant to an anti-suit injunction are set out in the landmark decision of the Privy Council in <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68454-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 871</a> (“Aerospatiale”) at page 892, as well as the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the court decides to grant an anti-suit injunction, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     An injunction will only be issued to restrain a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court, against whom an injunction will be an effective remedy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction depends on the presence of several elements, which were spelt out by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a> (“<em>AQN</em>”) at [44], having taking reference from <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham v Trane US Inc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     whether the foreign proceedings are <em>prima facie</em> vexatious or oppressive (or otherwise unconscionable);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the defendant any injustice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is not disputed that the Husband is amenable to the jurisdiction of this court (factor (a)), and my decision above on <em>forum non conveniens</em> finds that Singapore is the natural forum for this divorce (which resolves factor (b)). There is also no issue of any agreement between the parties on choice of jurisdiction (factor (e)). The crux of this application therefore lies with two of the above factors: the question of whether foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive (factor (c)), and whether the grant of the injunction would cause the Husband any injustice (factor (d)). I shall deal with each in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I turn first to the issue of vexation or oppression. In <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>, the Court of Appeal highlighted the factors to be considered in deciding whether the threshold for vexation or oppression had been met, at [44]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether there has been vexatious conduct involves an assessment and evaluation of a number of factors. The list of factors is not closed. The <u>inherent weakness of a claim</u> sought to be pursued in the foreign proceedings when taken together with other factors may be a relevant factor in considering whether the foreign proceedings are vexatious (see <em>VKC</em> at [19]). Factual findings which have supported findings of vexation or oppression include where the foreign proceedings were instituted in <u>bad faith or for no good reason</u>, are <u>bound to fail</u>, will <u>cause extreme inconvenience</u> (see the decision of this court in <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a> (“<em>Kirkham</em>”) at [47]), <u>amount to an unlawful attack on the plaintiff’s legal rights</u> (see the High Court decision of <em>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 2 SLR(R) 0457.xml')\">[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457</a> at [46]–[64]), or are <u>duplicative of Singapore proceedings</u> (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [112]–[129]). In so far as this last category is concerned, however, there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em> – something additional is required to make the duplication vexatious. For example, the greater the positive and voluntary involvement of the injunction respondent in the local proceedings, and the longer the local suit has been allowed to proceed before the commencement of the parallel foreign proceedings, the stronger the case for an injunction (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [137] as well as Thomas Raphael, <em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em>”) at paras 19.43–19.44). [<b>Emphasis added</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the present case, there is no indication that the case is bound to fail on the merits. The parties and their children are Malaysian citizens, and the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia. He is fully within his rights to file for divorce in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The principal contention by Counsel for the Wife is that the Malaysian proceedings were instituted in bad faith, given its timing and particular circumstances. In the present case, the Husband had initially filed for judicial separation on 31 October 2023, which he withdrew and substituted with a petition for divorce on 7 December 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Wife suggests that this change of position was not <em>bona fide</em> and was undertaken simply to bolster an application to stay the Singapore proceedings, given that the Malaysian proceedings were filed on the same day as the deadline for the filing of the stay application. The Wife also argues that the Husband’s ground of adultery in the Malaysian proceedings cannot be a serious one. She points out that it was filed more than five months after he was aware of the alleged facts of adultery on 27 June 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, and is inconsistent with an offer he made on 29 June 2023, just two days after learning about the alleged adultery, to register a new company in the Wife’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to the timing of the filings, Counsel for the Wife refers to <em>Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23402-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGCA 42</a> (“<em>Lakshmi</em>”) for support. The foreign proceeding in this case was filed almost three years after the respondent had the right to proceed, and some 20 months after the Singapore proceeding had been filed (see [89]-[90]). In addition, the foreign proceeding was commenced just one day after the respondent had received news that the Singapore suit would be proceeding (at [92]). The Court of Appeal saw this as evidence of bad faith on the part of the respondent (at [93]). Counsel’s view is that the present case is synonymous with the facts of <em>Lakshmi</em>, and should likewise merit an injunction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was however not persuaded that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing were sufficient to raise a finding of bad faith. Divorce is a personal matter, and parties may choose to file for their own reasons and at the timing of their choice, sometimes long after the fact. The Wife’s own divorce application on the basis of unreasonable behaviour relies on facts that go back to the couple’s teenage years. Indeed, in this case, the Husband was served with the Wife’s divorce papers on 16 October 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, and shortly after proceeded to file for judicial separation on 31 October 2023 (i.e. still choosing to preserve the marriage). He explained that he had thereafter reached out to the Wife, but she had declined further communication and displayed no intention of engaging in discussions relating to the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. According to the Husband, he only filed the Malaysian divorce petition on 7 December 2023 when he perceived that the Wife was determined to proceed with the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I found this to be a reasonable account for his change in position, and did not perceive that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing necessarily speaks to bad faith on his part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Counsel for the Wife also points out that there was no legitimate reason to commence duplicative divorce proceedings in Malaysia, when the Husband could simply have filed a counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings. While the Husband had explained that he had done so because the children were Malaysian citizens, Counsel for the Wife pointed out that he was already aware that the eldest child had been offered Singaporean citizenship and it was a “matter of time” she would accept<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Counsel also made reference to <em>Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21016-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 814</a> at [67], pointing out that the Court of Appeal in that case had rejected the relevance of foreign proceedings which were filed after the Singapore actions and which were no more than the converse of what the other party was seeking in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     This does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that all duplicitous proceedings deserve to be injuncted. I note that the Court of Appeal said in <em>VEW v VEV</em> (at [44]) that “there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em>”. Unlike in <em>Lakshmi</em>, where there were no strong connecting factors to the foreign proceedings filed in the British Virgin Islands, the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia with business interests there. It would be legitimate for him to exercise his preference to litigate in the legal system with which he is familiar. His decision to file fresh proceedings in Malaysia rather than challenge the Singapore proceedings by way of counterclaim cannot on its own be regarded as vexatious or oppressive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Finally, the Wife seeks to prove bad faith on the basis that the Malaysian proceedings are intended to cause extreme inconvenience to her. She couples this argument with the fact that the Husband had ceased paying maintenance from 1 November 2023, which she claims was intended to starve her of financial resources and prevent her from proceeding with the divorce. The Wife points to the asymmetry of resources between the parties, claiming that the Father is wealthy while she is unemployed and cash-poor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In support of this contention, Counsel for the Wife sought to rely on the following observation by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN</em> at [27]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, I find that the foreign proceedings are vexatious and oppressive, and an anti-suit injunction should be granted to meet the ends of justice. The wife has not been receiving maintenance from the husband. Her financial resources are strained, having to deal with the numerous applications filed by her husband both locally and in New York. The husband, who is wealthy on the other hand, has the resources to litigate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I was not persuaded by this argument. It is not disputed that apart from the matrimonial home (in which she resides rent-free), the Wife has two other properties in Singapore on which she can rely for passive income. While there has been a threat of legal proceedings to prevent the Wife from doing so, it is not disputed that she can exercise rights as a legal owner of the properties. Further, it is also open to the Wife to file for interim maintenance in Singapore if she was under financial pressure. The pending application for a stay would not have prevented her from doing so. The fact that she has not done so is telling, and undermines her attempt to demonstrate that she has been financially oppressed by the multiplicity of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In this vein, I would point out that the fact that multiple proceedings require the expense of time and money does not of itself render the situation vexatious or oppressive. This was the observation of the court in <em>VEW v VEV</em> at [101]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, the respondent’s counsel submits that there would be “time, effort and expense” incurred in the English proceedings. While that is true, this does not in itself show that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious or oppressive, or that the appellant is using the Part III proceedings to exert improper pressure on the respondent...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I would also take care to point out that the factual matrix in the present case differs quite significantly from <em>AQN v AQO</em>, where the anti-suit injunction was granted on the basis that the New York proceedings had left the wife financially strained. In that case, proceedings in both Singapore and New York had commenced for about four years before the anti-suit injunction was heard. The New York proceedings had gone through multiple hearings at the Supreme Court of New York from 2011 to 2013, the decision of which was under appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. Considerable time and expense that had thus been incurred due to a multiplicity of proceedings for four years in <em>AQN v AQO</em>. This is not the case on the present facts. Given the proximity of the jurisdictions and the parties’ resources at hand, and the fact that proceedings are in their infancy in both jurisdictions, it cannot be said that the multiplicity of proceedings would prejudice the wife’s ability to advance her case in either jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the Defendant any injustice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I turn next to the question of whether the grant of an injunction would be unjust to the Husband (factor (d)). The Husband submits that he would suffer a juridical advantage if the divorce and ancillary matters were heard in Singapore, as he would lose the chance to have all ancillary matters heard together with the divorce petition in Malaysia. He claims that the Malaysian process would be more expedited and efficient than the extended legal process in Singapore, which bifurcates the interim judgment for divorce from the hearing on ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I find it difficult to agree with this submission because there is no affidavit evidence on the steps required in Malaysian divorce proceedings, nor is there any proof that one legal system is in any way more expeditious or efficient than the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I did consider that in terms of enforcement, the Husband may face practical difficulty enforcing an order given by the Singapore court in his favour. However, I note the Wife has given an undertaking that any order made by a court in Singapore would be mirrored by consent in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Accordingly, did not find that any juridical disadvantage accrues to the Husband in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction against the Husband </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The starting point in an anti-suit injunction is quite different from that of a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In deciding whether to apply the invasive step of granting an <em>in personam</em> injunction against one party from proceeding in a foreign jurisdiction, the court must exercise great caution that the ends of justice do indeed merit such a serious imposition on the prerogative of a person to vindicate his or her legal rights in the manner and place as deemed fit. It is also a matter of comity between courts of competent jurisdiction that this draconian remedy should be exercised only when it is patently clear to all that the interest of justice requires one court to essentially deny the other of its right to exercise its jurisdiction. In the present case, while a multiplicity of proceedings is clearly undesirable, it is for the Wife to persuade the Malaysian court to grant a stay on the basis that Singapore is the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of divorce proceedings. I do not find the factors tipped so far in the Wife’s favour that the Husband should be injuncted from proceeding further in the Malaysian courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having considered the reasons provided above, the following directions were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s application for a stay on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in SUM 3790/2023 was dismissed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s application for an anti-suit injunction in relation to the Husband’s Malaysian proceedings in SUM 56/2024 was dismissed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As parties have each prevailed in one application and failed in the other, no order was given as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [27] and [40].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [59].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [75] and [76].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, at page 1204.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [68].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [101].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [47] and [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [70] and page 147.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at page 202-203.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, Volume 1, at page 121.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [16].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [55] and [56].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [39].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [99], at [99].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at pages 130-131.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [108].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 74.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 61.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>See 1PBOD, at page 429.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 2nd Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [5].</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of consent order – Custody, care and control of child – Child maintenance"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1182 of 2022","title":"XBA v XBB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 62","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32019-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chew Wei En (Teoh & Co) for the Plaintiff","Defendant-in-Person"],"timestamp":"2024-08-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XBA v XBB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBA <em>v</em> XBB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 62</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

In the matter before me, the ex-husband sought variation of the orders, largely related to the care of their 6-year-old son and the maintenance that was payable to support his expenses. More specifically, he asked that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the joint custody order that was agreed to between parties be varied to allow him to unilaterally decide on the child’s education and medical concerns in the event parties could not agree on them. <em>I dismissed this request but added that given the immediate need for the child to be registered for primary school, the ex-wife shall make the decision in the event parties are unable to reach agreement on the choice of school.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the original order which allowed for shared care and control of the child be varied to reflect specific days and times every week for the ex-husband to provide care for his child. He also sought that the child be returned home by 9 p.m. should either party bring the child out of the home and that “no romantic third parties (be) present during each party’s care period”. <em>I allowed the request to the extent that the child could be with his father every Wednesday after kindergarten ends to 8 p.m. on Fridays.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the maintenance for the child be reduced to $500 per month from $2 000 per month with educational expenses being paid by the ex-husband solely and directly to the kindergarten/childcare centre. <em>This was dismissed save that I had ordered the ex-wife to produce proof of kindergarten, childcare, tuition fees and medical cost before payment is made.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the ability of the ex-wife to remain at the home be until such time she remarries. <em>By the time the matter came before the court however, the ex-wife had already left the home with the child making this request for her to move out redundant.</em> She had also confirmed that she had registered her marriage with her new partner in May 2024. A child from this union was due to be delivered when parties came for the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the child attend counselling. <em>I made no order on this as there was an absence of any indication of the nature of counselling that was sought, why it was sought for the child alone and where or who was to provide this. Instead, I directed the engagement of the court’s counselling and psychological services unit to provide more information to the parties.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_f\"></a>(f)     the passport of the child be returned to the ex-husband by the ex-wife and that she is not to travel with the child without the ex-husband’ consent. <em>This was dismissed.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Against these orders, the ex-husband appeals. He also appeals on my order that each party was to bear his or her own costs for the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Varying Consent Orders</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The courts have been slow to vary consent orders. In family matters, the need for members of a family to progress beyond the grief arising from the breakdown of a family is assisted by the process of mediation which if successful, allows parties to own and therefore be empowered by the agreements that they reach. To unravel this would be to revisit the grief that they are encouraged to move from. There is also the potential for abuse if requests are made soon after mediated settlements especially if it were for the simple reason that one party feels that he no longer wants to abide by its terms. When it involves care arrangements and financial support for children, patience must be exercised, and sufficient time must be taken by the parties to allow the agreement to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (1961) provides for the ability of a parent to seek variation of a custody and/or care and control order if there was any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or a material change in circumstances. In <b><em>DDN</em></b> v <b><em>DDO</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Appellate Division stated that while a court would take a holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues relating to the welfare of a child, this should not encourage parties to pursue variation of orders at the earliest opportunity. The parents are to do their best in to successfully implement the ordered arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Similarly, an order for the maintenance of children made pursuant to s 127 of the Charter can be varied if there are material changes in circumstances or for any other good cause, the latter allowing a court a wide approach to variation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> When a paying party meets with a situation that significantly impacts his ability to pay, for example the loss of employment or a serious health concern, variation is typically allowed. Much too often however even the smallest of change in the expenses of a child sees a parent applying for variation in these courts. A child’s expenses will change, sometimes even within the month orders are made. Parents should pause and consider aspects such as the cost of living, the need to provide for ad hoc or unexpected expenses before applying for variation and understand that in certain months, not all of the maintenance is used up and in certain others, more is needed. The agreed amount should continue to be paid with such an awareness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Joint custody of the child – should there be variation?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The need to co-parent, sometimes even in the most volatile of relationships between former spouses has been extensively written on. The roots of co-parenting are respect for the needs of a child, a child who is born from the union of 2 people and who therefore deserves the involvement of each parent. Parenting does not end on the termination of a marriage. In fact, it should continue even stronger, freed from the tension and anxiety between parents caught in circumstances that they did not hope for at the inception of the marriage. Yet, continuing disagreement between parents even over the smallest of things make co-parenting appear theoretically sound but sometimes, a practical nightmare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the matter before me, the ex-husband did not seek a change to the joint custody arrangement that was agreed to but asked that he be given the sole decision-making ability when it came to the educational and medical needs of his son should the parties not be able to agree on issues arising in these areas. In cases where parties are not working well together, there is a real possibility that the interests of the child are compromised as a result. At the same time, allowing one parent to make all decisions relating to the education and health concerns of a child where parties cannot agree is often a licence given to that parent to point quickly to the slightest disagreement as basis for unilateral decision-making. I saw no need to change the order given that it was entered into only in January 2023 and parties have yet to begin to work together on these issues. There is certainly an issue with communication but in my view, the challenges were not being posed by the ex-wife alone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The child is in his second and final year of kindergarten. The ex-husband was concerned that his child was developing slower than his peers and accused the mother of not taking steps to better prepare the child for primary school, especially for Mandarin. He also alleged that she failed to attend at an organisation that was recommended to them by the child’s school for assessment to be conducted in order to ascertain if there were any needs which requires medical intervention. He wanted the child to move to another childcare centre he believed would support his child’s needs better.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife showed to the court another report from the school which presented a different and more positive picture. I could not place weight on that as it was unsigned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>The mother however had also taken the child for assessment at a local children’s hospital and the child was continuing with speech therapy at the hospital. She informed that the child was progressing well. She had also arranged for tuition classes so that he could be better prepared for primary school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> While these steps appear to be taken late in the day suggesting that she had wanted to advance her cause in these proceedings, there was no suggestion that she was negligent or that she would cease all assistance after proceedings. She spoke through an Interpreter during the hearing as she was in person. There was a genuine expression of concern for her son. What appears to be standing between parties is a different set of expectations on what a 6-year-old child should be exposed to as he prepares for primary school. She also claimed that she did not take up the suggestion to bring the child to the alternative assessment centre as she felt it would be better for the assessments at the hospital to be completed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>The local hospital is well known and regarded for its services in the development of infants and children and the ex-wife’s choice appears prudent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I intervened on one specific issue and that was in relation to the choice of primary school. Again, it is hoped that parties will agree but given that the need to register the child for primary school was coming up in July and parties were still unable to agree, I allowed the ex-wife to make that decision. The ex-wife had moved out with the child, has remarried and has permanent accommodation in Yishun. Her choice of school was one that was proximate to her new home. Given the imminent need to make a decision on the choice of school, I allowed the mother to make the decision as she was the main caregiver of the child at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Shared care and control – is further refinement necessary?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When the consent order on ancillary matters was made, the parties were living together. At the time this application was taken for variation, they were still in the same home. What then was the basis for the variation that was sought? It was the ex-husband’s position that the ex-wife restricted his time with his child and that the child was alienated from him. He pointed to the presence of the ex-wife’s new partner as instrumental in this difficulty.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>I found this hard to appreciate because the ex-wife was working and there were many times when the ex-husband was alone with his son. It was the ex-wife’s position that her former spouse never engaged with his son and that much of the interaction was with the domestic helper. She denied that access was prevented or restricted by her. They both attempted to show photographs and recordings to prove their point. I did not find any evidence of alienation. Indeed, it is difficult to make such a determination without a hearing which enables the evidence to be tested (<b><em>WQT</em></b> v <b><em>WQU</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> What is clear however is that a few supervised visitation sessions at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA) were scheduled for the ex-husband to connect with the child. It was the ex-husband’s position that it had ceased because the counsellors were of the view that the father-son relationship was good and there was no need for the sessions to continue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife claimed that it was the ex-husband who wanted to terminate the access at the DSSA as seen in the messages from the DSSA<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and that it showed how reluctant he was to participate or be truly involved in the child’s life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> If indeed as stated by the ex-husband, his interaction with his son was good at least during supervised access, any allegation that the ex-wife had successfully alienated the child is unlikely. It is more probable that the child is somewhat caught in the middle of parents who no longer get along. With the parents now living apart, creating a safe space and time for father and son will if the opportunity is taken up, be the beginning of a new and better relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As the ex-wife and child had left the home they shared with the ex-husband by the time this matter came up for hearing, I felt it prudent to define the dates and times when the father should have the child with him and provide care for him. I defined the days to be Wednesdays to Fridays (till 8 p.m.) which in my view is long enough to enable good contact and the provision of relevant care in the larger context of little to no access in the recent past and the father’s own position that as recently as September 2023 the access to his child was positive and did not require external intervention. At the same time, it was short enough to prevent a situation where the child having just moved to a new home would need to make significant changes to his routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the dates and times that I had allowed the ex-husband to use to care for his son do effectively take the form of access rather than shared care and control, I chose not to define it as such as this application is in my view rather premature and would benefit from further assessment in the year ahead. The arrangement put in place is not ideal because the child will be in primary 1 next year yet it is necessary at this time given that the ex-husband needs to be engaged with the child immediately and consistently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With formal schooling, the need for change to the orders is inevitable. An assessment taking into account where the child will be studying and living as well as the demands of school life would need to be made. I had given liberty to parties to vary this order at the appropriate time. At the time of the hearing, I was not entirely certain of important aspects which may determine the way forward for parties. There was suggestion for example that the ex-husband may remarry. A more permanent care arrangement would be contingent on aspects like the child’s residence, new family structures, the location of the child’s primary school, the school schedules, and whether he will be placed in a student care after school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was also the father’s request that if the child is brought out by the ex-wife, she would need to return him home by 9 p.m. and that no third party should be present during these outings. With the mother’s remarriage, the child’s family structure has changed even as his biological father should certainly continue with all the rights and responsibilities that come with a parent-child relationship. As for the child returning home by 9 p.m. everyday, I thought this too restrictive as there would be instances when the child may have to return a little later. There was nothing in the evidence other than the ex-husband suggesting that the ex-wife had been staying out late with her partner that warranted such an order. The circumstances of the ex-wife has materially changed as well which made such a request unnecessary. She has a new child with her husband and the need to care for the differing needs of an infant and her 6-year-old son would spell very few late nights, at least for the short to medium term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Maintenance – who should payment be made to?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Under the consent order, maintenance for the child was agreed at $ 2 000 per month. The ex-husband did not dispute the need for this amount nor his ability in providing it. He wanted to vary this amount to $500 per month and in addition, he wanted to pay for the child’s educational expenses directly to the schools/childcare centres. His position was that the ex-wife was not utilising the money for the child’s educational needs as she had failed to pay for his school fees.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife responded that she had paid for it regularly but that her ex-husband had proceeded to pay it for the months of May and June without informing her. He then informed her that he would be shaving an amount off the monthly maintenance to reflect the payment he had made directly to the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There was no proof that the child only required $500 per month if and when the ex-husband provided for the child’s educational expenses separately and directly to the school. What parties accepted as expenses of the child when the matter was mediated is not known. Food, clothing, medical expenses, accommodation are basic expenses which maintenance seeks to help support. The arbitrary sum of $500 was not adequately supported by documentation. He also did not share what educational expenses he was willing to provide directly for. Would it include for example, the assessments and therapy? What if more therapy is required? The husband appears to want control of what he pays for and I did not find that the ex-wife had intentionally refused to cater for their son from the maintenance given to her. Having said that, and while there was no material change in circumstances nor any good reason to vary the maintenance payment agreed to, it is important to prevent any fear of child maintenance being misused especially because it is a long-term commitment by the paying party. In some cases, it would promote understanding between parties for the receiving party to account for the expenses of the child which may change quite dramatically for young children entering different phases in their education. The ex-wife for example said that she had engaged tutors for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Additionally, she wanted to continue to have the child remain at the same childcare centre till the child enters primary 1 which the husband was not in agreement with. The ex-husband should be provided with documentation that these expenses continue to be relevant and I ordered that documentation for all school fees, childcare fees, tuition and medical expenses be notified to the ex-husband. The other expenses such as food, clothing and accommodation need not be accounted and was clearly within contemplation of the parties when the agreement for an amount of $2 000 per month was entered into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Should counselling be ordered for the child?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     One of the cornerstones of therapeutic justice is counselling and psychological services which if appropriately applied, can have a tremendous positive long-term impact on the lives of families. It is important however not to seek counselling for a 6-year-old child without any reference to the nature of the difficulty the child is experiencing and the type of programme that is being sought. The ex-husband through his counsel had not explained why only the child needed counselling and what exactly needed to be addressed. It is important to be mindful that the court cannot assume the nature of intervention. Counsel forwarding such requests should be clear on what, why and who they wish to engage for the specified purpose. There are many programmes available, and it is the obligation of counsel and his client to inform of the concerns and challenges. If it is to address access issues, these would already have been done at the DSSA which has not terminated its services. If it is to address developmental concerns, counselling would not be appropriate. In any event, the ex-wife seems to have taken steps in this regard at the local children’s hospital. I had in my orders called on the counselling and psychological services within the family court to engage the parties on appropriate channels of assistance if they required support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Who should hold the child’s passport?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The ex-husband sought that the passport of the child be given to him. He expressed fear that the ex-wife would leave Singapore with the child. Although the wife is Thai, there is no indication that she would flee to Thailand to prevent any contact with the ex-husband. She is married with her new family in Singapore. The only time she went to Thailand in the recent past was in 2023 after the challenges of the pandemic restored travel fully. She claimed that she was prevented from travelling by the ex-husband prior to this and disagreed with any suggestion of an intention to run off with her child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>I found no need to have the passport retained by the ex-husband. If she wishes to take the child abroad, she should be free to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Costs</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The ex-husband appeals against my order on costs. I had ordered that the parties were to bear his or her own costs for the matter. The ex-husband succeeded in part but was largely unsuccessful. I found his positions rooted in a sense of mistrust of the intentions of his ex-wife who has started a new life in Singapore rather than any real difficulty in engaging with his son. The issues were not complex, and the ex-husband had filed 2 affidavits for the matter. I did not believe that this was a case for an order of costs to be made against the ex-wife who appeared in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Consent orders should not be varied with ease. In this case, the matter was mediated, and the parties agreed on all issues related to their child in 2023 only for the ex-husband to seek variation so quickly in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The need for the child to bond with his father is an imperative. The child’s step-father cannot replace the biological father-son relationship. The relationships can certainly co-exist meaningfully. Equally important is the need for the parents to start to speak civilly with each other to enhance the potential for a successful parenting journey. The consent order needs time to work. I have structured the time each parent has with the child to allow for the relationship to resume if disrupted, and to grow. The reality is that the child will commence formal schooling next year and his needs will change continuously, and an assessment would be prudent next year. It is not for the parents to dictate what they each want. It is always about what the child needs. The child’s changing circumstances will inevitably dictate the response that the parents need to adopt.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[2024] SGHC(A) at paragraph 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Section 72 of the Women’s Charter.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 19 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Tab B, page 15 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraphs 14-16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 25 of the affidavit of the ex-husband dated 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24154-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 3</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Affidavit of ex-husband dated 5 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Tab A, page 13 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 38 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Tab C, page 20 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Disclosure of company – documents","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 877 of 2023 (Summons No 1978 and 1979 of 2024)","title":"XBI v XBJ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 66","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32013-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ivan Cheong, Shaun Ho, Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBI v XBJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBI <em>v</em> XBJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32013-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 66</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

They were married on 8 December 2007 in the United Kingdom. They had four children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 1 August 2019, the entire family relocated to Singapore. They have lived here since. That they have lived here for a period of three years immediately preceding the filing of the divorce provides the basis for the Family Court having jurisdiction over their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) sets out, in detail, how the Husband had behaved in such a manner such that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Specifically, it is disclosed that the Husband was not only financially irresponsible in that he racked up enormous debts, but that he had also been cruel and unkind towards the Wife. It appears, from the SOP, that the Husband’s behaviour was, in part, fuelled by the suspicion that the Wife had been having an affair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 February 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 18 May 2023. Parties embarked on the road towards the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is against this backdrop that the Wife took out her application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1979/2024 (“SUM 1979”) and SUM 1978/2024 (“SUM 1978”) respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       By the time the matter had come up for hearing, counsel for the Wife had whittled down the items they were seeking in discovery and interrogatories. In the end, the Wife only pursued five items in respect of discovery. The Husband, having discharged his lawyers, was unrepresented at the hearing. I heard both SUM 1978 and 1979 on 12 August 2024 and reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I shall deal with Items 1 and 2 given that they both related to the Husband’s bank account statements. These were the requests as had been framed in Items 1 and 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Item 1:</b> the Husband’s consolidated bank statements for his accounts with DBS and POSB for May 2021 to February 2023 and June 2023 to December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Item 2:</b> the Husband’s bank statements for his Wise Account – for May 2021 to December 2022, July 2023 to December 2023 and April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As counsel for the Wife, Ms Imogen Harvey (“Ms Harvey”) had argued at the hearing, the salient issue in respect of Items 1 and 2 was that the Wife required these statements to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. This was because the Husband had been financially irresponsible, and in addition, there was a dearth of documentation evidencing his income and expenses. In addition, Ms Harvey explained that the statements were also needed to ascertain whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Ms Harvey also referred to the decision in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> where the court had, at [26(d)] and [27], affirmed the principle laid down by the court in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> that it is useful for the court as well as the party seeking discovery to have a “picture of the other party’s financial circumstances just before the marriage broke down, during the break down of the marriage, and after the filing of divorce proceedings”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, the Husband disputed that he had been financially irresponsible. He said that he did not understand why there was a need for him to disclose bank statements going back to 2021. The Husband also expressed frustration that money was being spent on lawyers to litigate the divorce when that money could be better spent on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In deciding whether to order discovery, I bear in mind the twin principles of relevance and necessity – that the documents sought must be both relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matter. The point of the discovery process, after all, is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matter has all the evidence placed before them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 1 and 2. I agree with the point that Ms Harvey had made – that it is useful for the court as well as the Wife, to have an insight into the Husband’s financial situation in the months leading up to and after the filing of the divorce. This is especially since the SOP discloses that the Husband’s behaviour towards the Wife had begun to deteriorate on or around January 2022, marking the beginning of the end of the parties’ relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The bank statements sought would also provide a clearer picture as to the Husband’s financial situation, especially in the months leading up to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to Item 3. This was a request for the bank statements of a company, XL. Although the Husband had stated in his Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that XL was a partnership, this does not appear to be the case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Wife had, in her supporting affidavit for SUM 1979, disclosed a printout from a search done on the UK register of companies which showed that XL was a private limited company that had been incorporated on 12 October 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The same printout also discloses that the Husband is one of two directors of XL, and that he owns more than 25% but not more than 50% of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Following from this, it is the principles relating to the disclosure of company documents that had been laid down in the High Court decision of <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (“<em>ACW</em>”) (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194), which are applicable in the present case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">20    More directly, a helpful summary of the relevant principles relating to discovery of documents belonging to a company of which the husband was a director and shareholder can be found in <em>B v B</em> at 193–194:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The documents of a company are in the legal possession of the company. If they are or have been in the actual physical possession of a director who is a party to litigation they must be disclosed by that director, if relevant to the litigation, even though he holds them as servant or agent of the company in his capacity as an officer of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    If the director who is a party to the litigation does not have physical possession of the documents, the question of fact of whether the documents are within the power of the director arises. “Power” in this context means “the enforceable right to inspect or obtain possession or control of the document” in the personal capacity of the director. This is in contradistinction to the right to inspect vested in a director in his capacity as a director. Without the consent of the company, the director has no right to inspect the documents. Much will depend on the share structure of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    If the company is the alter ego of such a director so that he has unfettered control of the company’s affairs, he must disclose and produce all relevant documents in the possession of the company. Where the company is not the alter ego of a director, the factors to be considered are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    the extent of the shareholding of the husband;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   whether it amounts to control of the company;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   whether the minority shareholders are adverse to him;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iv)   how the board of directors is constituted; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(v)    whether there is any objection by the board to disclosure of any of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    A very wide range of issues are relevant in proceedings relating to ancillary matters. The court has to assess what the husband is shown to have, but also what could reasonably be made available to him. In many cases, audited accounts of companies of which the husband is a shareholder will be sufficient, together with full disclosure of all the husband’s personal financial records. But there are cases when the court will go behind company accounts and order discovery of company books and documents. It is not usual, however, for the court to take this course unless there is evidence before it from accountants or other experts that the published accounts of the company cannot be relied upon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Where relevant documents in the possession of a company are disclosed by a director as being in his custody or power, the court has a discretion whether or not to order production of them. In exercising the discretion, the court will have regard to all the circumstances and balance the relevance and importance of the documents and the hardship likely to be caused to the wife by non-production against any prejudice to the husband and third parties likely to be caused by production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    It has not hitherto been the practice of the court to order production of company documents to which the board of directors objects on affidavit, provided that the court is satisfied that the objection is not contrived for the purpose of frustrating the powers of the court. The court will not in the exercise of its discretion order parties to do that which they have no power to do. The court will not order production unless it is satisfied that production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the issues between the parties or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Where the wife cannot obtain documents on discovery, she may be able to apply for leave to issue a subpoena against the secretary or other officers of the company to produce relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The principles in <em>ACW</em> formed the foundation of Ms Harvey’s argument. She argued that the statements which the Wife sought were in the Husband’s control – this is because the Husband had disclosed some documents belonging to XL. As to the relevance and necessity of this documents, Ms Harvey highlighted the possibility that the Husband was using XL’s bank account as though it were his own. These documents would therefore demonstrate whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets, and were also relevant to ascertaining the true extent of the Husband’s financial means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, the Husband said that he was willing to provide XL’s certified accounts which would give the Wife a picture as to XL’s financial transactions. Those certified accounts, however, would only be available at the end of February.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3. I agree with Ms Harvey’s arguments on the relevance and necessity of these documents. I also find that these documents are either within the Husband’s physical possession or power to obtain (see <em>ACW</em> at [20(a)] and [20(b)]). After all, the Husband had disclosed a copy of XL’s unaudited financial statement for the year ended 31 October 2022 in his XL.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This suggests that he may have other company documents, including its bank statements, in his physical possession. Even if he does not, that he was able to disclose XL’s unaudited financial statement and offer to disclose its certified accounts certainly suggests that he can obtain and produce the documents that the Wife seeks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I come now to Item 4. This was a request for the Husband to produce documents evidencing the model and registration year for his vehicle. As Ms Harvey explained – the Wife needed these documents to verify the Husband’s assertion that this vehicle was worth £1500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s response was that the Wife could have easily obtained the model and registration number of his vehicle from the documents that he had already disclosed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. If the Husband claims that vehicle is worth a certain amount, he accordingly bears the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to Item 5. This was a request for the financial statements of XL for the financial year ending 2023. Ms Harvey highlighted that the Husband had no objections to producing these statements but he had also said that they were not ready. The Wife was thus seeking an order that the Husband disclose these statements once they had been prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ms Harvey also pointed out that there was no overlap between the Wife’s request in Item 5 and Item 3. This was because the financial statements were needed to value the Husband’s shares in XL, whereas the bank statements were needed to determine if the Husband was indeed using XL as his “piggy-bank”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I allow the Wife’s request in Item 5. The financial statements of XL are certainly relevant to valuing the Husband’s shares in the company. For completeness, I would note that the court’s power to order discovery also extends to documents that will come into existence at some point in the future: <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [20] citing <em>G v G (Financial Provision: Discovery)</em> [1992] 1 FLR 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       S/N 3(a) – 3(c) (see Item 1 above at [8(a)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       S/N 3(d) (see Item 2 above at [8(b)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       S/N 3(e) (see Item 3 above at [14]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       S/N 2 (see Item 5 above at [22])</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>of the Annex to SUM 1979, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Apart from the above orders, I also direct that the Husband file his affidavit complying with the orders that I have made for discovery by 16 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to the costs of SUM 1978 and 1979, Ms Harvey argued that the Husband should pay the Wife costs fixed at $5000. Disbursements came in at $370. She argued that a robust costs order should be made to take into account the multiple delays occasioned by the actions of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, the Husband said that there should no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The starting point is that the successful party is entitled to costs, though the court can depart from that starting position if the circumstances of the case warrant it: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> citing Rule 852 and Rule 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife had substantially succeeded in her application for discovery. She is therefore entitled to costs. I order the Husband to pay the Wife costs fixed at $2750 (all-in). This sum is to be paid by 16 September 2024. In arriving at this decision, I take into account the fact that the Wife did not ultimately proceed with her application for interrogatories, that the matter was not particularly complex, the length of the affidavits that had been filed as well as the work done by the Wife’s counsel in filing written submissions. This quantum of costs also accounts for the Husband’s dilatory conduct, specifically, that he was habitually late in meeting court deadlines despite having been represented by counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Finally, I would add that based on the facts before me, I did not think that the relationship between the parties was so acrimonious as to warrant making no order as to costs (see <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it remains for me to commend Ms Harvey for her excellent advocacy at the hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>SOP at para 2b(i).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at para 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 1979 at pp 45 – 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at Tab 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>The Notice of Intention to Act in Person, In Place of Solicitor was only filed on 18 July 2024 – this was after the final case conference where SUM 1978 and 1979 were fixed for hearing before me.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)","title":"XBG v XBH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 65","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32012-SSP.xml","counsel":["Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBG v XBH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBG <em>v</em> XBH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 65</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I heard parties on 7 August, and now give my decision in respect of SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background to SUM 1204</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the facts as disclosed in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The Husband is a Singapore citizen, and the Wife is Vietnamese. They were married in Singapore and registered their marriage on 27 February 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties welcomed a son (“A”) into their family. Aside from A, the Wife also had another son (“X”) who was born out of wedlock. A and X are aged 7 and 15 respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The SOP tells us why their marriage broke down. It sets out details of how the Husband had behaved in such an unreasonable manner that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. She filed for divorce on 19 April 2023, and interim judgment was granted on 2 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. Given that the Wife had refused to disclose certain documents and did not satisfactorily answer the interrogatories posed during the voluntary disclosure process, the Husband took out SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I turn now to deal first with the Husband’s application for discovery. I add that I am proceeding primarily on the basis of <em>oral</em> arguments made by both the Husband as well as counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo Eng Chye (“Mr Teo”), at the hearing before me. Although Mr Teo had, on 18 July 2024, put in a set of written submissions purportedly addressing the Husband’s application in SUM 1204, those submissions appeared to have dealt solely with ancillary matters. I could find nothing in that set of written submissions dealing with the issues of discovery or interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In deciding whether to order discovery, I am guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity. In other words, the Husband must demonstrate that the documents which he is seeking discovery of are both relevant and necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>WXI v WXJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31581-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 31</a> at [6] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10]; Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In this connection, it must be noted that a liberal view is generally taken as to what is considered relevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters – this is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matters has all the evidence before them to arrive at a decision: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [23] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> was a request for the Wife to provide the monthly statements for the following bank accounts in her name for the past 2 years:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS account ending -6;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     OCBC account ending -xx1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     MayBank account ending -x5; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     An account jointly held with X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband explained that these statements were relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Wife’s earning capacity, specifically, how much money she was making from the business that she was running. Apart from this, the Husband also argued that the bank statements would allow him, and the court, to determine if the Wife had been dissipating matrimonial assets – the Husband had pointed to a withdrawal of some $20,000 from one of the Wife’s accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo, argued that the Wife had already disclosed all the documents that she had, and that it was impossible to retrieve documents dating that far back. In respect of the joint account with X, Mr Teo said that X was not the Husband’s adopted son. The Wife’s position appears to be that because X is not the Husband’s adopted son, he is a third party and so there is no need for the Wife to disclose the statements of that joint account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     What Mr Teo said drew a sharp response from the Husband who argued vigorously that he was indeed X’s father. The Husband explained to me that he had signed all of X’s adoption papers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1. The two-year period of disclosure which the Husband seeks also covers the months leading up to the Wife’s filing of the divorce. The law on this is clear – it is indeed useful for the court to have a view as to the financial circumstances of parties leading up to and following the filing of the divorce: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31610-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 36</a> at [34] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a> at [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I would also add that the Wife cannot side-step her disclosure obligations by simply claiming that she does not have or is unable to produce these statements. She must provide an explanation together with the relevant supporting documents (such as a letter from the bank stating that such records are no longer available): <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [10] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Item 2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> was the Husband’s request for the Wife to provide the following documents of her sole proprietorship (“MD”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Supporting documentation of her business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     IRAS Notice of Assessment for the year 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The basis for the Husband’s request in Item 2 is that there is a massive discrepancy between what the Wife claims that she earns, and what she can afford. According to the Husband, the Wife had declared in her Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that MD was suffering monthly losses to the tune of $7000. Despite this, she had somehow managed to find the money to invest in property in Vietnam and to buy a car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, Mr Teo said that according to the Wife, MD was indeed making a loss. If the Husband claims that MD is making a profit, he had to provide some proof of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s AOM, she states that MD has a deficit of $7094.78, and that she draws a salary (<em>ie</em>, her take-home monthly income) from MD of $3000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In addition, the Wife also states, but provides no further details, that she has a source of income from Vietnam that is not consistent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I note that the Wife has provided nothing by way of documentation in relation to MD. That said, she has provided her IRAS statements for the Year of Assessment in 2022 and 2023. This was her assessed income:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 2022: $11,650</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In 2023: $24,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I observe, solely from what the Wife has disclosed in her AOM, that there does appear to be some discrepancies. For example, if it is true that her monthly take home salary is $3000, her assessed income for tax purposes is markedly lower. In addition to this, the Wife claims, on the one hand, that MD, which is her business, is running a deficit of approximately $7000 every month. Yet on the other, she claims that she has a monthly take-home salary of $3000. It is difficult to see how the figures add up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request and order that the Wife disclose all financial documents relating to MD including, but not limited to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Bank statements;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     MD’s business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Supporting documentation of MD’s business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to allow the Husband, as well as the court, to assess the Wife’s means. This will have a direct bearing on issues such as maintenance. However, I make no order in respect of the Wife’s IRAS statements given that those have already been disclosed in her AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to Item 3.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was a request for the Wife to provide all documents to prove her claimed expenses for MD.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given the extent of the disclosure I have ordered (see above at [21]), I make no order in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I turn now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Husband is seeking documents relating to the two properties that the Wife has in Vietnam. Specifically, the Wife is asked to provide documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Showing the description of the property, the property title and value;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Relating to the sale of the properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As I understood it, the Husband has two main reasons for wanting these documents. First, to determine when these properties were bought. This had a bearing on whether these properties should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets. Second, if these two properties were sold, whether the sales proceeds should be added back into the matrimonial pool. In this vein, the Husband claimed that contributed $80,000 towards acquiring the second property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Mr Teo’s response was that disclosure should not be ordered as these two properties, having been transferred to the Wife’s mother, could not be considered as matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is well established that it is for the court hearing the ancillary matters to decide what constitutes a matrimonial asset. As I had observed in an earlier decision, parties have to strictly observe their disclosure obligations and cannot tailor the extent of their disclosure in accordance with their own views on what constitutes their matrimonial assets: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [81] citing <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [17]. In any event, it cannot be seriously disputed that the documents which the Husband seeks are clearly relevant to the disposal of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 4.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I turn now to the Husband’s request in Item 5<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and 6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Both these requests relate to the Wife’s expenses on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In respect of Item 5, the Husband is asking for documentary evidence of all expenses for A for the last 6 months. During the hearing, the Husband explained that he wanted these documents because the Wife had claimed, as part of her expenses, certain sums spent on A, but had not provided any documents evidencing the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In respect of Item 6, the Husband is asking that the Wife provide the “school fee receipt or statement of payment” to prove that she had paid [X]’s school fees of $740 as she claims to have done in her AOM. The Husband explained that he had proof that he was the one who had paid [X]’s school fees, and that the Wife was simply trying to inflate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In response, Mr Teo explained that in respect of Item 5, the Wife had already disclosed the documents in her AOM. As for Item 6, the Wife’s position was that she no longer had those documents because she would dispose of them once the school term had ended.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The golden rule of litigation, that he or she who asserts must prove their case, applies equally to the hearing of ancillary matters. Any argument that the Wife has not adduced evidence to back up claims made in her AOM is best ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In that connection, the discovery process should not be used as a means of testing the veracity of the other party’s claims (see <em>WYI v WYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31642-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 39</a> at [60]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband’s request in respect of Items 5 and 6 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I come now to the Husband’s request in Item 7.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband wanted the Wife to provide documentary evidence to show that she had paid about $1000 per month for the water and electricity bills. Again, the Husband explained that the Wife had provided no evidence to back up her claims. On the contrary, he claimed to have evidence showing that she did not pay these bills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I disallow the Husband’s request in Item 7. As I have explained above (at [33]), if the Wife claims to have borne certain expenses, she has the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s final request in Item 8<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> was for the Wife to provide documents relating to her business in Vietnam which she says provides her with a source of income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As I had noted above (at [18]), the Wife had not provided any documents relating to this income which she is allegedly receiving from her business in Vietnam. She had also not stated, in her AOM, the amount of money she was receiving from this business in Vietnam. I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 8. These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to ascertaining the Wife’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The twin principles of relevance and necessity also govern when the court will order interrogatories to be answered. In addition, it is also trite law that at this stage, the court is only concerned with the sufficiency of the answers that had been given, and not the <em>truth</em> of those answers (<em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [27] – [30]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The interrogatory framed in Item 1 was a request for the Wife to state her employment history for the past decade (from 2015 to 2024) with relevant details such as the employer name and monthly gross income.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In addition, if the Wife was self-employed during this time, she was also to state the nature of the business and the duration in which she was self-employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     This was the response which the Wife had given in her voluntary response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a husband, the Defendant should know better. The Defendant would be a complete failure if he is not aware of what the Plaintiff is working as.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This is an insufficient answer. The Wife had clearly not answered the interrogatory. She had given a response that was sarcastic and insulting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, Item 1 was clearly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters hearing given what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM. While the Wife had disclosed that she was a beauty technician and had owned MD, she had provided no other details as to what she was working as before she had set up MD, and what other employment she had found after MD had closed down. It would be useful for both the Husband and the court to have a fuller picture of the Wife’s employment history – this was certainly central to assessing her means, and to determine if there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets on her part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The interrogatory framed in Item 2 required the Wife to state details of her business venture in Vietnam – this included, amongst other things, the source of funds used for the business venture.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This interrogatory stems from what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM – that she had an inconsistent source of income from Vietnam.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     This was the Wife’s response:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>A</b>.     <b>Please state the nature of the Business venture in Vietnam:</b> The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam and the Plaintiff would like to claim losses as a result of being his wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>B</b>.     <b>Business start date:</b> The Plaintiff had the Vietnam business from September 2023 to October 2023. The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>C</b>.     <b>Business Participation:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down because as his wife, there was no time to do business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>D</b>.     <b>Business Funding Amount:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down, unless the Defendant agree to pay for the Plaintiff’s losses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>E</b>.     <b>Source of funds for business venture:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>F</b>.     <b>Income statement from business:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply and/or provide the Defendant with documentary evidence as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     It is clear that this response is insufficient. The Wife had not provided the details sought, except to state that the Vietnam business was in operation from September to October 2023. Apart from the fact that her answer was insufficient, it is also plainly provocative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 2. The details of the Wife’s Vietnam business are indeed relevant and necessary to ascertaining her means at the hearing of the ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I come now to Item 3. This was a request for the Wife to state all the properties in which she either owned or had an interest in, and to provide details of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff did not know which properties the Defendant were talking about.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This is not, in my judgment, a sufficient answer. The interrogatory, as it is framed, is capable of either a positive or a negative answer. It is not sufficient to claim ignorance as to which properties the Husband is referring to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 3. I am satisfied that the interrogatory is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – specifically, determining which assets fell into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I come now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The manner in which this interrogatory was framed suggested that the Husband was asking for the Wife’s monthly bank account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     During the hearing, the Husband clarified that he was actually asking the Wife to state the amounts in her bank account from February 2023 to February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had already provided the bank statement for her 3 banks account in Singapore, for appropriate care and upbringing given to son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that I had allowed the Husband’s request for the Wife to disclose her bank statements (see [13] above), I do not think that this interrogatory is necessary. The Husband’s request in respect of Item 4 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In summary, these are the orders which I make in respect of SUM 1204:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the documents listed at paragraphs 3, 4, 6, and 10<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her possession, custody or power, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall answer the interrogatories as set out at paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by 28 August 2024. Cost submissions for SUM 1204 are to be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of three pages each. This should be done no later than 28 August 2024. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I must emphasise that the interrogatory process is not an opportunity for a party to hurl snide remarks. The manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories was completely unnecessary and only served to risk aggravating matters between the parties (see above at [41] and [46]). Such behaviour is unacceptable in our family justice system. To that end, parties are to, in their submissions on costs, address me on whether any costs ordered should also take into account the manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories that had been put to her.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 3(c) on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>As set out at para 3(c) of the Wife’s AOM on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at p 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at pp 8 and 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>These have been referred to in this judgment as Items 1, 2, 4, and 8.</p></div></content></root>"}]
