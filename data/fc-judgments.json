I heard the application on 30 September 2024 and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       It was the Husband who filed for divorce on 9 February 2024. According to the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”), parties were married on 4 August 2019 in India. Both the Husband and the Wife are Indian citizens.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has been resident in Singapore since 2019 when he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor at one of the local universities (“X”). The Wife remained in India to complete her doctoral degree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The COVID-19 pandemic meant that both the Husband and Wife were kept apart, though they remained in touch via virtual means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties were reunited after travel restrictions had been lifted. They had a good relationship during this time. They went on many trips together. The SOP states that the Husband brought the Wife on numerous trips to Europe in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was not to last. Cracks in the relationship began to form when the Wife began to verbally attack the Husband. They quarrelled over money. The Wife accused the Husband of ruining her career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the state of their relationship, parties agreed to separate, and the Wife agreed to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This did not happen. The Wife returned to Singapore. The SOP states that she began a scorched earth campaign – this included sending complaint letters to the Dean of the local university where the Husband was employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This led to the Husband filing for divorce. The Wife filed her Defence thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> At this time, she was unrepresented. On the 10<sup>th</sup> of May 2024, she appointed counsel: Mr K Jayakumar Naidu (“Mr Jayakumar”) of Jay Law Corporation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Mr Jayakumar subsequently took out SUM 2274 to amend the Wife’s Defence. The purpose of this application was to tidy up the Defence. Mr Jayakumar had formatted the Wife’s Defence and tidied it up as best he could. In doing so, he separated the paragraphs which formed the Wife’s Defence, and the paragraphs which formed her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Pang Khin Wee (“Mr Pang”) of IRB Law explained that the Husband only had a single objection to the proposed amendment which was the inclusion of an allegation that the Husband had used research grant money to pay for the trips to Europe (see above at [5]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Mr Pang urged me to consider Rule 422(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”), which states that the court may at any stage of the proceedings allow any party to amend their pleading, in light of the applicable principles for striking out pleadings which are instantiated in Rule 405 of the FJR 2014. According to Mr Pang, Rule 405 demonstrates that pleadings should not contain scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters. Given that the proposed amendment contains scandalous, frivolous or vexatious matters, it should not be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     There is much force to the proposition that the court will not allow amendments to pleadings if the proposed amendments contain matters that are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (to use the language of Rule 405 of the FJR 2014). After all, amendments are generally allowed for “the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [422.02] citing <em>The “Virginia Rhea</em>” [1983 – 1984] SLR(R) 639 at [5] citing with approval <em>GL Baker Ltd v Medway Building &amp; Supplies Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/5141-E-M.xml')\">[1958] 1 WLR 1216</a> at 1231.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     What I have said above, however, would likely only be in issue where the proposed amendment seeks to introduce new facts into the pleadings. In the present case, however, the line which the Husband took offence with was already contained in the original Defence which the Wife had filed. This was what the Wife had stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“My husband, plaintiff took me different places in Europe, using research Grant’s money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This was the proposed amendment:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had brought the Defendant to the various countries mentioned in the SOP with the money the Plaintiff was given as a research grant by [X], the school he was employed by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There is, in substance, no real difference between the proposed amendment, and what was contained in the original Defence. The only changes are, as Mr Jayakumar explained, purely cosmetic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Therefore, even if I am minded to accept Mr Pang’s argument (which, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not) – that the proposed amendment should be rejected, the allegation that the Husband had used money from the research grant to bring the Wife on trips would still remain, warts and all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the circumstances, I will therefore allow the Wife’s application to amend her Defence. The amendments correct a defect in the Wife’s Defence, namely that she had not separated matters that formed part of her Defence, and matters that formed part of her Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I shall hear parties on costs. It remains for me to thank both Mr Pang and Mr Jayakumar for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife’s Defence was filed on 28 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supplementary Affidavit dated 14 August 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Setting aside of division order – Whether consent order should be set-aside or varied because of one party’s mental capacity under doctrine of unconscionability","Family law – Consent Orders – Whether contractual vitiating factors of unconscionability and incapacity apply"],"date":"2024-10-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 3188 of 2021, (Summons No. 1758 of 2024)","title":"XDN v XDO","citation":"[2024] SGFC 88","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32296-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Tan Xuan Qi Dorothy and Ms Chua Qi Shan, Charmaine (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mr Nai Thiam Siew Patrick and Ms Choo Yean Lin (Tan Lee & Partners) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-10-15T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XDN v XDO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XDN <em>v</em> XDO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32296-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 88</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Interim Judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was thus granted on 5 August 2021 where the orders relating to the ancillary matters (“AM Orders”) of divorce were made “<em>by consent</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Certificate of Final Judgment was granted on 9 November 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In June 2024, more than 2½ years later, the Defendant filed the present application, <em>ie.</em> FC/SUM 1758/2024 (“SUM 1758”) seeking to revoke or vary some of the AM Orders contained in the IJ. The Defendant claims that he was labouring under certain “mental disorders” at the time the IJ was granted and thus – according to his counsel – the IJ was obtained despite the Defendant’s “<em>mental incompetence and mental incapacity</em>”, or that the IJ should be set aside on the grounds of “<em>unconscionability</em>” because the Plaintiff had taken advantage of the Defendant’s situation at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For completeness, the Defendant seeks to set-aside Orders 3(c), 3(d)(a) – (f) of the IJ (“Disputed Orders”). In gist, these are the Orders relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets which the Defendant says do not reflect and “<em>just and equitable</em>” division of the parties’ assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant says these orders were no “<em>fair</em>” because they were made “<em>totally for the benefit of</em> [the Plaintiff]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To be clear, the Defendant does not seek to set aside the other orders in the IJ relating to: (i) custody, care and control, and access to their child, [K] ; and (ii) the maintenance payable to the Plaintiff and [K].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Based on the parties’ written submissions and the counsel’s oral arguments, the issues before this Court are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Does the Family Court have the power to vary or revoke the IJ on account of a parties’ alleged mental “incompetence” or “incapacity, and/or on account of alleged “unconscionability” by one party?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Has the Defendant satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify revoking or varying the Disputed Orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I will discuss each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Basis For Revoking Or Varying Consent Orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I start by providing a brief overview of the applicable principles in relation to an application to revoke (or set-aside) orders dividing the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the WC (for ease of reference, I will refer to such orders as, “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) allows the Court to “<em>extend, vary, revoke or discharge</em>” at any time such division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     While s 112(4) appears, on first glance, to be broadly drafted, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> has made clear that this statutory provision does not give <em>carte blanche</em> to the Court to vary division orders given the need to ensure finality in ancillary matters proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal then proceeded to explain that the court may intervene to <em>vary</em> division orders where the order was unworkable, or has become unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This is the oft-cited “unworkability” test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The relevance of contractual vitiating factors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     What is less clear are the situations where the court may <em>revoke</em> division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In <em>AYM</em>, the Court of Appeal recognised that fraud may be a sufficient basis to vary or set-aside a division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal also referred to its earlier decision in <em>AOO v AON</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 1169.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 1169</a> (“<em>AOO</em>”) where a division order made by consent may be set-aside if there has been a lack of full and frank disclosure.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal alluded to the fact that in the commercial sphere, the courts have recognised specific vitiating factors – <em>eg.</em> misrepresentation, mistake, duress, undue influence and unconscionability – which may operate to unravel a binding contract or agreement between the parties concerned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, the Court of Appeal made clear that because the issue before the court did not relate to these vitiating factors, the Court of Appeal declined opining on the precise application (if at all) of each of these vitiating factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Indeed, the Court of Appeal expressly noted that in its earlier decision of <em>AOO</em>, it also “<em>left open the issue as to whether or not a consent order could be set aside on grounds other than the absence of full and frank disclosure of the material facts…”</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the subsequent decision of <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a>, the High Court (Family Division), referring to <em>AYM</em>, held that the power to set aside or vary a consent order on the division of assets must be exercised narrowly and observed in passing that the applicant must provide one of the “<em>vitiating factors</em>”, or that the order was or has become unworkable. However, the High Court did not specify which “vitiating factors” it was referring to, although the parties’ allegations in <em>UMM</em> related to claims involving “<em>duress or misrepresentation</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Finally, it is also useful to have regard to the earlier decision of the High Court in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46305-M.xml')\">[2004] SGHC 275</a> (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”), where the High Court opined that s 112(4) of the WC “<em>should not be construed be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact more equitable in the objective opinion of the court</em>” and that what the court should be alert to is that “<em>one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As <em>Lee Min Jai</em> was decided well before the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>AYM</em> or <em>UMM</em>, it is not entirely clear whether the High Court was referring to the same vitiating factors noted in the latter decisions when it had referred to concept of one party having taken “<em>unfair advantage</em>” over another.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The upshot of the above discussion is that the issue of whether an otherwise binding consent order on the division of matrimonial assets could be set-aside (or varied) on the ground of undue influence and/or unconscionability has not been definitively addressed by the Court of Appeal or by the High Court. Although the High Court in <em>UMM</em> and <em>Lee Min Jai</em> alluded to the possible relevance of contractual vitiating factors and/or just and equitable grounds, the exact contours as to how these principles are to be applied were not discussed in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The doctrine of unconscionability </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the purpose of the present case, <em>both</em> parties’ counsel took the position that the doctrine of unconscionability may apply to set-aside division orders made by consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In particular, both counsel cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>BOM v BOK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22844-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 349</a> (“<em>BOM v BOK</em>”) as providing authoritative guidance of the doctrine in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given both parties’ position on the applicability of <em>BOM v BOK</em>, I will proceed on the basis (without deciding definitively) that unconscionability represents a vitiating factor which allows this court to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In this regard, the Court of Appeal – after undertaking a comprehensive review of the different conceptions of the doctrine of unconscionability in various Commonwealth jurisdictions – held as follows (at [142] – [143]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">142    In summary, and at risk of oversimplification, the <b>narrow doctrine of unconscionability applies in Singapore</b>. To invoke the doctrine<b>, the plaintiff has to show that he was suffering from an infirmity</b> that <b>the other party exploited in procuring the transaction</b>. Upon the satisfaction of this requirement, the <b>burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable</b>. In this regard, while the successful invocation of the doctrine does not require a transaction at an undervalue or the lack of independent advice to the plaintiff, these are factors that the court will invariably consider in assessing whether the transaction was improvident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">143    It is important, though, to reiterate that the application of <b>the criteria of infirmity must not be overly broad</b>, lest we be led back, in effect, to the broad doctrine of unconscionability. It is also important to note that although there might be overlaps between our approach and the broad doctrine of unconscionability – at least because the latter would, by its very nature, encompass situations falling within the former – the broad doctrine of unconscionability still goes further than our approach because it may potentially encompass fact situations where the “special disability” concerned (see Amadio, per Deane J at [132] above) is something broader than the type of infirmity we referred to in the preceding paragraph. That said, an overly broad application of the narrow approach we have endorsed might assist in stretching our narrow approach to cover a fact situation that is not intended to fall within it. We therefore find it imperative to caveat at this stage that our approach ought not to be utilised in such a manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Additionally, the Court of Appeal noted that whether there has been an infirmity on the part of party asserting unconscionability is an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry, and that not every infirmity would be sufficient to invoke the doctrine. The Court of Appeal also noted that “[s]<em>uch infirmity must also have been, or ought to have been, evident to the other party procuring the transaction</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will thus apply the aforesaid legal principles in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Setting-aside a contract due to mental incapacity </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Apart from alleged unconscionability, the Defendant also submits that the Disputed Orders should be set-aside or varied on account of his alleged “incapacity” and mental “incompetence” at the time they were made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As with the issue of unconscionability, neither counsel expressly addressed in their submissions the question of <em>what</em> is the exact legal nature of this assertion and the context under which it was made; counsel appeared to assume that “incapacity” or “incompetence”, if proven, are reasons to set-aside the Disputed Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While it might appear obvious, it remains relevant and important to properly situate the Defendant’s arguments. As I would allude to below, the gist of the Defendant’s case is that he was suffering from Adjustment Disorder (with Depressed Mood) and Alcohol Use Disorder (collectively, referred to as the “Disorders”). He therefore argues that he “<em>did not fully understand and comprehend or know the ramifications of what</em> [he] <em>was signing</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In effect, the Defendant is saying that the draft IJ he had signed (which resulted in Disputed Orders being part of the AM Orders) was voidable due to his mental incapacity at that time under the common law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     To be clear, I did not consider the relevance or application of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 as neither party raise the same for the Court’s consideration. I have also proceeded on the assumption that mental incapacity is a contractual vitiating factor which applies to matrimonial division orders made by consent between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In <em>North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Megatrucare Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25970-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 110</a>, the General Division of the High Court (“High Court”) noted that the legal test of determining whether a contract is voidable due to a party’s incapacity (as set out in the earlier decision of <em>Che Som bte Yip v Maha Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1989] 2 SLR(R) 0060.xml')\">[1989] 2 SLR(R) 60</a>, a case cited in the Defendant’s Bundle of Authorities) required the party asserting a lack of capacity to prove that the other contracting party <em>knew or ought to have known that he was mentally disordered and had no contractual capacity</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the Defendant’s allegations also involved alcohol use, the High Court’s observations in <em>Resort World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Lee Fook Kheun</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22620-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1039</a> (“<em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>”) are also apposite. In <em>Lee Fook Kheun</em>, a case involving a claim by a casino patron to invalidate a credit facility agreement he had entered into with the casino, the High Court held (at [21]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">21    Intoxication results in impairment of mental capacity, and for that reason has been likened in the law to mental incapacity: see <em>Molton v Camroux</em> (1849) 4 Exch 17,19; 154 ER 1107,1108. A person seeking rescission must show that, first, when he entered into the transaction he was so drunk that he was unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction. This level of understanding was explained by Hallett J in <em>Manches v Trimborn</em> (1946) 115 LJKB 305, 307 as “such a degree of incapacity as would interfere with the capacity of the defendant to understand substantially the nature and effect of the transaction into which she was entering.” Second, the counterparty to the transaction must have known of his infirmity. In <em>York Glass Co Ltd v Jubb</em> (1925) 42 TLR 1 (CA) 2, the claim failed as the counterparty “did not know and had no reasons to know that [the complainant] was out of his mind at the time.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In summary, the principles which may be gleaned from the case law is where a party asserts that he lacked mental capacity (whether by reason of an alleged medical condition, or intoxication) when he had entered into an agreement, that party must show:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that he had no mental capacity at the time he entered into the contract, and that he was unable to understand its general nature and effect; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the <em>other party</em> knew about this infirmity and that he lacked contractual capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is only when <em>both</em> requirements are satisfied that the court would find that the contract is voidable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It follows from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above that the central issue before this Court is whether the Defendant was suffering from mental incapacity (<em>ie.</em> that he lacked contractual capacity when he signed the draft IJ on 7 June 2021), or some form of infirmity (in the context of the Defendant’s case under the doctrine of unconscionability), which the Plaintiff had known, and/or taken advantage, of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The key question was thus whether the alleged Disorders operated on his mind on 7 June 2021 such that it gives rise to an alleged incapacity or infirmity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant has failed to show that he was labouring under any incapacity or infirmity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Defendant has wholly failed to establish his claim that he was so infirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In support of his case, the main piece of evidence relied upon by the Defendant is the medical report which he had obtained from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) in November 2023 (“IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report”), almost 2½ years <em>after</em> he had executed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In gist, the IMH 1<sup>st</sup> Report was prepared in response to a request for a medical report on the Defendant and in it, the hospital set out the Defendant medical history and the doctors’ diagnosis (<em>ie.</em> the Disorders) following his admission into IMH on 31 August 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In a follow-up report prepared by IMH dated 22 December 2023 (“IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report”), IMH provided further clarifications on the nature of the Disorders and the possible causes of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, I agree with the Plaintiff that nowhere in the IMH’s 1<sup>st</sup> Report or 2<sup>nd</sup> Report was a definitive statement that the Defendant was <em>in fact</em> suffering from the Disorders in or around June 2021. Indeed, as the Plaintiff’s counsel pointed out in their submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely opined that the <em>symptoms</em> of the Defendant’s Adjustment Disorder “appeared to have started about two to three months prior” to 31 August 2021. This was a largely tentative statement based on <em>inter alia</em> the Defendant’s <em>self-reporting</em> of increased alcohol consumption in the preceding months.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Importantly, the IMH doctor who prepared the IMH Reports expressly stated that he was “<em>not able to comment on the Defendant’s mental capacity retrospectively as</em> [the doctor] <em>had not assessed him when he signed the Consent Order of Court for his divorce matters</em>”. This was a crucial point as that meant there was no objective evidence whatsoever as to whether the Defendant was in fact suffering from the Disorders in June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     What was more critical was the complete absence of any medical opinion or evidence that the alleged Disorders did affect (or was even capable of affecting) the Defendant’s contractual capacity, or his understanding of the Draft IJ. The IMH 2<sup>nd</sup> Report merely explained that a person with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood develops “<em>emotional symptoms of depressed mood like feeling low and hopeless in response to identifiable stressor or stressors</em>” and in respect of Alcohol use Disorder, that the individual would spend a great deal of time obtaining or using alcohol and exhibit symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and tolerance. None of the IMH Reports specifically mentions any mental impairment on the individual’s ability to understand or enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It is plainly insufficient for the Defendant to merely point to his physical or mental ailments at a particular point in time, without establishing a link between those ailments and his ability to enter into contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Dorothy Tan (“Ms Tan”), who submitted that the present case is analogous to <em>UMV v UMW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21967-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 60</a> (“<em>UMW</em>”). In <em>UMW</em>, a husband sought to set-aside a draft consent order which he had signed because <em>inter alia</em> he had been taken advantaged of as he was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Mood Disorder at the relevant time when the consent order was signed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In rejecting the husband’s application, the learned District Judge in <em>UMW</em> noted that despite all the medical reports adduced by the husband, none of them “<em>went so far as to say either that the</em> [husband’s] <em>condition had impaired his ability to make decisions at the material time or that his free will had been overborne when he consented to the</em> [consent order]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I agree with the Family Court in <em>UMW</em> that there must be a causal link or connection between a party’s mental state/condition <em>and</em> his ability to understand the draft consent order when he executed it. Otherwise, any party would be allowed to renege on his/her legal obligations years later by pointing to the existence of some mental condition at the time the contract or agreement was signed even though the said condition had no effect on that party’s ability to enter into a binding contract.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant was not exploited or taken advantage of</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The lack of objective documentary evidence in support of the Defendant’s claim of mental incapacity or infirmity must also be weighed against the surrounding circumstances leading up to, and following, his execution of the Draft IJ on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As Ms Tan had pointed out in her submissions – the Plaintiff, through her solicitors, sent draft copies of the relevant divorce papers (which included the Draft IJ) in late April 2021. This was 4 months before the Defendant was admitted into the IMH, and more than 1 month before the Defendant signed the Draft IJ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Moreover, the circulation of the divorce papers in 2021 must not be considered in isolation. The Plaintiff also provided evidence that both parties had previously discussed the possibility of a divorce and the division of their matrimonial assets the year before, in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In text messages exchanged between the parties on or around 21 February 2020, the parties discussed the terms of a potential divorce including the transfer of their matrimonial flat to the Plaintiff with “<em>no refund to</em> [the Defendant’s] <em>cpf</em>”. The Defendant then asked the Plaintiff what this proposal meant, and after the effect of such a term was made known to the Defendant, he responded “<em>ok</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was therefore not surprising that in the divorce papers circulated by the Plaintiff’s solicitors in April 2021, clauses were included for the transfer of the matrimonial home without refunds made to the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund (or “CPF”) account, in line with the proposal made the year before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In any case, the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ email dated 30 April 2021 fairly and unambiguously stated that the Defendant was “<em>strongly encouraged</em>” to “<em>seek independent legal advice</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Defendant was also asked to identify any parts of the proposed divorce terms he did not agree with, and to provide his counterproposal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It was within this context that the Defendant responded to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, via email on 5 May 2021, indicating that he had already “<em>signed</em>” a copy of the papers and that the solicitors should verify the same with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s solicitors then replied to the Defendant informing him that arrangements need to be made for him to sign the documents in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths (“CFO”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This was followed by a series of email correspondence between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s solicitors arranging to execute the divorce documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Thus, contrary to what the Defendant’s counsel had sought to argue,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I find that there was nothing in the exchange of correspondence between the parties which suggests any pressure being placed on the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In fact, the Defendant was clear in his email responses that he had wanted to sign the documents to complete the “<em>proceeding</em>”. The correspondence also did not show the Defendant expressing any hesitation or uncertainty <em>vis-à-vis</em> the terms of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties eventually decided on 7 June 2021 as being the date the Defendant would attend before the CFO to sign the relevant divorce papers. The CFO in question was one Ms [N].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Given the seriousness of the allegations relating to the Defendant’s capacity to sign the Draft IJ, the Defendant was directed by the Court (at a Case Conference conducted for the present application) to invite Ms N to provide her response/account as to what had transpired on 7 June 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Ms N stated, in her email reply to the Defendant’s solicitors on 1 August 2024, that she could not recall specifically the event in question given that it occurred in 2021 (some 3 years ago).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> However, Ms N was clear in that it was her practice when asked to witness the execution of divorce documents (for simplified divorce track cases) that she would ask the defendant to go through the papers, especially the draft interim judgment. She will then ask if the defendant understood the contents and whether the defendant agrees with the contents. She will remind the defendant of the clause in the draft interim judgment as regards his right to independent advice. She will only request the defendant to sign the draft interim judgment if the defendant agrees. This process is then repeated for the rest of the divorce papers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In my view, there were no cogent reasons or basis provided by the Defendant to challenge Ms N’s evidence as to what she would normally do, or that she <em>did not</em> carry out the same steps in his case. In fairness to the Defendant’s counsel, he did not seek to challenge Ms N’s position at the hearing of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I thus accept Ms N’s explanation and find that she had undertaken the same process when the Defendant attended before her on 7 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I should add that next to where the Defendant’s and Ms N’s signatures were placed in the Draft IJ, there was appended in clear type-written print the words, “<em>I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice</em>”. This puts in beyond peradventure that the Defendant was not only informed of his right to seek legal advice, he had also freely and independently provided his assent to the terms in the Draft IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, the Defendant’s conduct <em>post</em>-execution of the Draft IJ also reflected his understanding <em>and agreement</em> with the divorce terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In support of the Plaintiff’s case, she exhibited the text messages she had exchanged with the Defendant on 12 August 2021, one (1) week after the IJ was granted by the Family Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In these messages, the Defendant discussed the sale of the parties’ cars and even sought to explain to the Plaintiff how she could reduce the costs of purchasing a new car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     These discussions on the cars are relevant because part of the Disputed Orders required the Defendant to sell the cars and for the sale proceeds to be retained by the Plaintiff. This was also one of the Orders he is now asking this Court to set-aside. If the Defendant was of the view that this was an order which should not have been made, why then did he discuss with the Plaintiff how to implement it? More importantly, there was nothing in the messages disclosed which suggests that the Defendant was dissatisfied with the Disputed Orders, that he did not understand what the Orders meant, or that he was labouring under some form of incapacity or infirmity; he was clear and specific as to what he wanted to inform the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Accordingly, I find that the Defendant was <em>not</em> suffering from any mental incapacity or infirmity which vitiated (or affected) his consent when he executed the Draft IJ. He was not in a state (whether induced by alcohol or otherwise) which rendered him unable to understand the general nature and effect of the transaction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Further, and in any event, it is clear from the discussion on the applicable legal principles set out above (at [22] and [31]) that the mere presence of a mental infirmity on the Defendant’s part is insufficient to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability and/or mental incapacity to set-aside a legally binding contractual document. The Defendant must <em>also</em> show that the Plaintiff knew about the said infirmity and had taken advantage of, or exploited, the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In this regard, I find that the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) <em>did not</em> in any way take advantage of the Defendant in the execution of the Draft IJ. The evidence adduced showed that there were <em>no indicators</em> exhibited by the Defendant which would cause the Plaintiff (or her solicitors) to think or believe that the Defendant did not agree with the Draft IJ, or that he was labouring under any infirmity or incapacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In any event, any doubt which the Defendant could have exhibited by his behaviour or conduct (which I have found not to be present) would have been adequately addressed when the Defendant attended before the CFO and had executed the divorce documents in her presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As stated above, I find that the CFO, Ms N, had ascertained his understanding of the Draft IJ, including his right to seek independent advice and the Defendant had indicated his agreement to the terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to prove the existence of any mental incapacity on his part, or any unconscionability on the Plaintiff’s part, which justifies the Disputed Orders being set-aside or varied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other Observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     My finding that the Defendant has not proven that he was labouring under any mental incapacity or infirmity as at 7 June 2021 (or in the overall divorce process) sufficiently disposes of SUM 1758.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     However, I will make a few more observations arising from the submissions and issues raised by counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     First, much of the Defendant’s written submissions sought to present his case as one involving some abstract conception of “unfairness”, or that the terms of the IJ was not “just and equitable”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     As Ms Tan had pointed out during her submissions, these abstract references do little to assist the Court in reaching a decision in the case. I would go further to say that a court applies the law, and the relevant legal principles; cases are not decided based solely because one party (or a court) later believes an outcome appears “unfair”. As Choo J in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> had aptly emphasised, s 112(4) of the WC should not be seen as an invitation to rewrite the terms of a settlement so that they appear “<em>more equitable</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> That is not the purpose of the statutory provision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Indeed, the Family Court’s processes and procedures have been designed to ensure that an unrepresented party would be given the relevant opportunity and information to take independent legal advice in cases under the simplified divorce track. For example, litigants are required to execute a draft consent order (or interim judgment) which contains an express clause to remind the litigant of his/her right to independent legal advice and that the terms of the draft order have been agreed to on that basis. To further reinforce this, the unrepresented litigant is required to sign the document before a solicitor or a CFO, who is not acting for the other party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the present case, all of the above procedural safeguards have been followed. Ms N, the CFO, confirmed that she had explained the relevant matters to the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s solicitors too acted appropriately and fairly by emphasising to the Defendant in their correspondence that he could seek independent advice and could even provide counterproposals if he wanted to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I am unable to see how the Defendant was treated unfairly or unjustly. If the Defendant chose to agree to the terms of the Draft IJ and had executed the relevant documents, despite numerous reminders given to him to seek independent legal advice, it does not lie in his mouth now that he had been ignorant to the terms of the Draft IJ because he had not instructed solicitors to act for him at that time. Put simply, a bad bargain is not an unfair bargain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Second, as alluded to above, both counsel appear to accept that the whole suite of vitiating factors (including concepts such as mental incapacity and the doctrine of unconscionability) applies with the same force and rigour to matrimonial consent orders as they do to contracts in the commercial sphere. This is despite the fact that the Court of Appeal has not, in fact, definitively determined the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As the applicability of these vitiating factors was not challenged by the parties, I had applied the same in my determination of the present case. However, my decision should not be taken as the court having accepted the position advanced by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In my view, one could argue that not all contractual vitiating factors recognised in the commercial sphere should apply unattenuated to matrimonial consent orders. As I had noted at [72] above, the execution of draft consent orders in matrimonial proceedings are subject to clear procedural safeguards. The legal force of the eventual order emanates from the court which does not act as a mere “rubber stamp”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This stand in contrast to commercial contracts where similar features may not be present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Further, concepts such as whether the impugned commercial transaction was at a “<em>considerable undervalue</em>” or whether it was “<em>fair, just and reasonable</em>” (arising from the application of the narrow doctrine of unconscionability) may not automatically sit well with other principles of matrimonial law. It is, for instance, not clear whether these concepts are analogous to the principle of “just and equitable” division of the parties’ matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(10) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     If so, are parties then required to advance hypothetical scenarios/arguments before the variation court as to whether the marriage was a single or dual income, or what approach or methodology should be applied to divide the parties’ assets? These submissions may arguably be necessary if the court is required to assess whether what the parties had agreed under the impugned consent order was better (or worst) of than what the Family Court would hypothetically have ordered if the parties had chosen to undergo a contested hearing for the division of their assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In fact, such difficulties did arise in the present case (albeit in the form of a preliminary issue raised by the Plaintiff’s counsel). At the commencement of the hearing of SUM 1758, the Defendant’s counsel sought to provide the supposed values of the assets mentioned to in the Disputed Orders with the intention of showing how much the Defendant had unfairly “given up” as a result of what he believes to be an “unfair” order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Yet, Ms Tan rightly pointed out that the parties never had the benefit of any court-mandated disclosure or discovery process to ascertain the nature of their assets or the correct value of the same when the IJ was granted, precisely because they had already agreed to settle the divorce amicably. I note that there were also no allegations of material non-disclosure or fraud raised by the Defendant which suggest that he did not know what assets the parties owned (or the value thereof) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The Defendant’s attempt to ascribe values for assets which existed more than 2 years earlier was therefore entirely speculative. This was especially given that the Defendant’s values were unsupported by any objective evidence. There is also the question as to whether the party responding to such assertions (for <em>eg.</em>, the Plaintiff in the present case) would be prejudiced given that he or she would then be required to ascertain the value of assets which may have since been disposed of, or lost, due to the effluxion of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It follows from the above that a court may not be in a position to then use these speculative figures or arguments to ascertain the hypothetical question of whether the terms of the consent order were at an “undervalue”, or that the division order was not “fair, just and reasonable” when it was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     However, as these issues were neither fully argued by the parties nor put before me, I shall say no more on the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Finally, I had, in the analysis set out above, focused on whether the Defendant has provided sufficient basis to set-aside the Disputed Orders. As I have found that he has failed to prove the existence of any incapacity or infirmity, or that he had been taken advantage of, the Disputed Orders will not be set-aside. I will also not <em>vary</em> any of the Disputed Orders for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     To be clear, I did not consider the issue of whether the Disputed Orders (or the AM Orders generally) ought to be varied because of any alleged “unworkability” of specific terms in the AM Order. For example, the Defendant’s counsel alluded to the fact that the deadline for the sale of the parties’ matrimonial assets, as envisaged in the AM Order, has since expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In this regard, I agree with Ms Tan who submitted, in response to the Court’s clarification, that neither party made submissions on the issue of unworkability and, importantly, that the Defendant must be held to what he had specifically prayed for in SUM 1758, <em>ie.</em> for the Court to decide whether Disputed Orders ought to be set-aside or varied for the specific reasons of the Defendant’s incapacity or under the doctrine of unconscionability, and not some other reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     If there are any concerns as to the continued workability of the AM Orders (including whether there has been overpayment by the Defendant through the use of his CPF monies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>), those concerns should be properly ventilated at the appropriate forum when the appropriate application is before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In conclusion, I dismiss SUM 1758 in its entirety as the Defendant has not made out his claim that the Disputed Orders should be varied or set-aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     It leaves me to express my gratitude to counsel for their submissions and, in particular, to Ms Tan for her oral and written submissions which I had found to be clear and detailed, and from which the Court has derived much assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dd 15.07.24 (“PA1”) at [8] and [13] – [24].

The ex-wife (“Wife”) had applied for a PPO to restrain the ex-husband (“Husband”) from committing family violence against her while the Husband filed an application for a PPO to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After hearing from parties on their applications for PPOs against each other, I granted PPOs in both applications i.e. a PPO in favour of the Husband in SS 640/2022 to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him as well as a PPO in favour of the Wife in SS 762/2024 to restrain the Husband from committing family violence against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband has filed an appeal against my decision in SS 762/2024, the Wife’s application for a PPO against him and I set forth below the reasons for my decision. I would also mention that with regard to the Husband’s application for a PPO against the Wife in SS640/2022, during the trial, the Wife had admitted to committing family violence against the Husband on the relevant day and after considering the facts and circumstances, I granted a PPO in favour of the Husband against the Wife as I considered that it was necessary for his protection in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Parties married on the 4 April 2012 and divorce was granted on the 5 January 2021. The parties have 2 daughters who, at the time of the conclusion of the Ancillary Matters were 11 and 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 11 April 2022, Ancillary Orders were made by the court granting sole care and control of the 2 children to the Wife, with access to the Husband. It was as a result of the older daughter (the “Child”) not returning to the Wife’s residence after one of the access sessions that the series of events that eventually led to the cross PPO applications occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a PPO may be issued if the court finds on a balance of probabilities that (a) family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member; and (b) it is necessary for the protection of that family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 64 defines “family violence” to mean the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The section proceeds to carve out the exception of self-defence by qualifying as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While in the usual case, the first limb of s 65(1) is fulfilled by family violence having been determined to have been committed, it is important to note that a PPO may also be made pre-emptively, where family violence is “likely to be committed” and even if family violence has not in fact been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It should also be noted that the onus rests on the party bringing the application to show on a balance of probabilities that family violence had been committed and that it is necessary for their protection that a PPO be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incidents of alleged violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Both PPO applications were based on a single incident which took place on the 7 January 2024 and I set forth below the account of each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On the 7 January 2024 at around 10pm, the Wife arrived at the Husband’s home with 2 police officers as the elder daughter of the marriage (“the Child”) had not returned from access. According to the Husband, the Wife insisted that the court orders should be complied with and since she had been granted sole care and control of the Child, she wanted the Child to return to her home after the access session. The Husband recounted that the Child refused to return home with the Wife. All of this transpired while the Husband and the daughter were inside his house and the Wife and the 2 policemen were standing outside with a metal gate separating them. The Husband eventually opened the gate on the bidding of the policemen and also the daughter who wanted the gate to be opened. The parties and the Child appear to have continued their discussions and eventually the policemen left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband recounted that shortly thereafter, the Wife started pulling the daughter out of the house by holding onto the child’s body. The Husband explained that at that juncture, he grabbed the Wife’s forearm to prevent the Wife from forcing the Child to leave with her and the Wife reacted by kicking, punching and scratching him. In the meantime, the Child had been released from the grip of the Wife and stood outside the gate. The Wife then told the Child to run to the lift. The Husband recounted that that he held onto the Wife’s right hand and tried to push her out of the house with the intention of trying to stop the Wife from hitting him and also from leaving with the daughter. He maintained that he had used “some strength” but after the Wife started hitting and punching him, he reacted by holding harder onto her hand to stop her. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     By that stage, according to the Husband, the child had run to the lift and at the same time, his mother who was at home at the time surfaced and witnessed the commotion. The child then signalled to her grandmother to call the police, The Wife then told the child to run and the child then went into the lift and left the scene by taking the lift to the ground level. Thereafter the Husband still holding onto the Wife took the lift down with the Wife. He contended that the Wife had been continuously hitting him. As they arrived at the ground floor and stepped out of the lift, they found that police officers had arrived at the scene, and it was at that point in time that he let go of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband maintained that he had not committed Family Violence against the Wife as he had acted in self-defence and had grabbed her purely for the purpose of preventing her from leaving with the daughter against the child’s will and from preventing her from hitting and punching him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s account of the incident on 7 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Wife recounted that on 7 January 2024 at around 10pm as the daughter had not come home from access with her father, she had gone to the police station and requested that the police accompany her to the Husband’s residence to help her seek the return of the Child. When she arrived at the Husband’s residence with the police, she spoke to the Child who told her that she would go back with her only if the Wife did not pursue the maintenance enforcement application she had made against the Husband. As they continued the conversation, according to the Wife, the Child then started to say that she wanted to go back with her. Shortly thereafter, the metal gate was opened and as the daughter had agreed to go home with her, the daughter put on her shoes and stepped through the entrance of the Husband’s residence into the corridor outside of the house. At that point in time, the Husband grabbed the Child’s hand and started to pull her. The Wife explained that to stop him from pulling the Child back in, she hugged onto the Child and pulled at her. At the same time, she stepped on the Husband’s feet and pressed down hard in the hope that he would let go of the Child’s hand. The Child managed to break free and the Wife then told her to quickly run to the lift to take the lift down. At that point in time, the Wife maintained that she tried to block the Husband and he then grabbed her upper arms forcefully to try to stop her. She then kicked him on the stomach area in a bid to get him to release her. The parties continued in their positions until the Husband’s father came out to try to stop them but the Husband flung off his father’s hand. When the lift door opened, both of them entered the lift and took the lift to the ground floor where they found the police with the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife did not deny that she had caused the Husband “hurt” and admitted that she had inflicted family violence on him. She maintained that by the same token, the Husband had also caused her hurt by grabbing onto her upper arms and in this regard she provided photographs of bruises as well as a referral letter written by the medical clinic she had attended on the 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Witnesses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In addition to his account of the incident, the Husband had called his parents as witnesses to provide their version of the incident. The Husband had at the trial indicated to the court that he had intended to call the daughter as a witness in support of his case but just before the trial, the daughter had been warded into hospital as a result of a mental breakdown and remained in hospital for observation. In light of this he could not call his daughter to appear as a witness for the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In contrast, the Wife did not call any witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Family Violence had been committed by the Husband on the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Based on the Husband’s own account, he contended that he had not hit the Wife back but had merely held onto her to restrain her so that she could not force the child to go back home with her. He was also contending that he had restrained her also to stop her from hitting him and accordingly he had not committed any family violence on the Wife but had acted in self-defence. The Wife’s case was that the Husband had caused her hurt by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt and this was evidenced by the bruise she had suffered on upper arms. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, I also thought it relevant to consider if the Husband had inflicted family violence on the Wife by “wrongfully confining or restraining [her] against ..her will”. Accordingly, the questions to be considered are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Husband had caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Upon consideration of the accounts provided by each of the parties as well as the account provided by the Husband’s witnesses, I noted that the Child had clearly been conflicted on the day. I accepted that the Child had spoken to the Wife about dropping the maintenance enforcement claim she had filed against the Husband and appears to have indicated to the Wife that this was a precondition to her returning home. This was not challenged by the Husband but he also explained that the Child had only been willing to return home provided she was allowed to live with both of her parents. Regardless of the actual reason, it was clear that the Child was in two minds about returning to the Wife’s residence but was also not averse to this. The fact that the Child had in the circumstances and after the long discussions put on her shoes suggests that the discussions with both parents had reached the point where the Child was ready to return with the Wife. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that both parties agreed that it was the Wife who had asked the Child to run to take the lift down to the ground level which the Child appeared to have responded to. If indeed the Wife had physically removed the Child against her will from the Husband’s residence as the Husband recounts, it would have been unlikely that the Child would have responded to the Wife’s instructions to run.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband indicated that he had restrained the Wife by holding her by her forearm on that day with a view to pushing her out of the house as she had tried to take the child with her. I did not find that his account made sense and found that the Wife’s account of events appeared to be more consistent and logical. Based on the sequence of events, it would appear that the Child had already agreed to leave with the Wife and had put on her shoes when the scuffle began and it would have been more likely that the Husband had held onto the child’s hand in a bid to prevent her from leaving with the Wife. In response, the Wife had grabbed onto the child who was literally caught in between the 2 parents during the tussle and at the same time started stamping onto the Husband’s foot to get him to release the child. The Wife’s efforts must have paid off as it appears that shortly thereafter, the child was out of the grip of both parents and ran towards the lift. The parties then started focussing on each other with each trying to prevent the other from running to the child. It was not disputed that at this point, the Husband held onto the Wife to prevent her from leaving with the child and in response the Wife started hitting and kicking the Husband in an attempt to get him to release her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I considered the Husband’s contention that as the Wife had continued to hit and kick him, he had no alternative but to restrain her in self -defence. In the case of TEK v TEJ <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a>, the court referred to the Court of Appeal case of Tan Chor Jin v PP [2008] 4 SLR 206 where the concept of private defence was referred to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose….”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on his own account of events, it was the Husband’s position that he had grabbed onto the Wife’s forearms to restrain her from taking the Child with her. According to him, as the Wife grabbed the Child in an effort to pull the Child out of the house, he had grabbed the Wife’s hand to “prevent her from…physical contact…to stop her from pulling my daughter.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was clear that the initial act of restraint by the Husband was not an act of self-defence but was an act of restraint with an intention of restraining the Wife from leaving with the Child. Subsequently as the Wife tried to break free, she started kicking and punching the Husband:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“…. I used some strength… I tried to push her away without holding at first. Then subsequently…. the mother…. after pulling out my daughter, then reacted, ….by kicking and punching me repeatedly… Then I reacted.. by holding…..harder on her hand while to… to try to stop her from hitting me…”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>While the subsequent reaction of the Husband by grabbing onto the Wife even “harder” could be described as a reaction to her hitting and kicking him and can be argued to have been in self- defence, the initial act of restraining the Wife at the outset cannot be considered to be self-defence and in fact, it was apparent that the Wife’s act of “kicking and punching” the Husband was a reaction to the Husband’s restraint as she was trying to break free. I do not think this was a situation where the Husband had found himself “suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation”. The Husband’s act of restraining the Wife led to the Wife’s reaction of kicking and punching him and was clearly a situation created by the Husband himself. Accordingly, I was of the view that the Husband had not acted in self-defence on that occasion. It should also be noted that the restraint by the Husband continued even after the child had left the scene and was no where close to either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In view of this, I concluded that the Husband had wrongfully confined or restrained the Wife against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     With regard to the bruises suffered by the Wife, which were not challenged by the Husband, it was clear to me that they were as a result of the force used by the Husband in restraining the Wife and I was of the view that the Husband had also caused hurt to the Wife by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, based on the above, I determined that on the balance of probabilities, the Wife had proven that Family Violence had been inflicted on her by the Husband during the incident on 7 January 2024. I would add, that while I had reached the conclusion that family violence had in fact been committed by the Husband on the Wife based on the evidence before me, taking into account the continued and heightened acrimony between the parties, their behaviour towards each other during the trial and the fact that there would be ongoing child access arrangements which likely might lead to further disputes between the parties, I determined further that family violence “is likely to be committed” going forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether it is necessary for a PPO to be granted for the protection of the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As the incident in question arose out of the current access arrangements and bearing in mind that there will be continued access by the Husband to both daughters, the likelihood of another similar dispute and incident ensuing is high. In light of this, I determined that it was necessary for a PPO to be granted against the Husband for the protection of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Having considered all of the evidence and submissions before me, I granted the Wife’s application for a PPO against the Husband. It is worth noting that I had also granted the Husband’s application for a PPO for his protection. I had also made counselling guidance orders which required both parties to attend counselling in the hope that this will provide to both of them some insight into their current situation and help them understand the requisite boundaries which should not be crossed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this case, I would also add that the Child has been severely impacted on by the divorce and the continued acrimony between her parents. On the day of the incident, upon the parties’ arrival at the ground floor, they had found the daughter who had taken the lift down earlier, with the police. In his statement, the Husband provided the following account in his police report of the incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <sup></sup>“… causing my daughter to break down and wanted to end her life by trying to snatch police gun. My daughter is subsequently suppressed with assistance from the 2 police officers. Subsequently, my daughter was escorted to IMH by police for mental check-up due to her act of suicide/self-harm…”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is indeed a very sad and dire state of affairs and I reiterate that during the trial, I was informed by parties that the Child had been warded into hospital in the days before the trial as she had suffered a nervous breakdown. In the circumstances, I would strongly urge the parties to consider taking a step back from the fighting and warring and instead focussing on the bigger picture of the needs of their children, particularly the Child, as well as the future of their children. At the end of the day, family disputes are a zero sum game - there are no winners or losers in family disputes and but the biggest losers are often the children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Note 1: Transcript for SS640/2024 and SS762/2024 at page 7 of 61, lines 2 to 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Note 2: Transcript for SS640/2024 and SS 762/2024 at page 10 of 61, lines 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Note 3: Transcript for SS640/2024 and SS 762/2024 at page 7 of 61, lines 4 to 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Note 4: Police Report No A/2024xxx/70xx filed by the Husband on 27 March 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-10-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)","title":"XCL v XCM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 85","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32273-SSP.xml","counsel":["VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","The defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-10-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCL v XCM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCL <em>v</em> XCM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32273-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 85</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 October 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; The defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCL — XCM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 October 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SUM 2194/2024 (“SUM 2194”) and SUM 2193/2024 (“SUM 2193”) was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories respectively.

She is therefore entitled to costs (see <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). Considering the circumstances of the case, namely that there was not a large number of items pursued in discovery, and that SUM 2194 did not involve any novel questions of law, I fix costs of SUM 2194 at $1500 (all-in). This sum shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife by 12 November 2024. I also order that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum from the Husband, make payment to the Director of Legal Aid as is required under s 16 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (see <em>XDF v XDG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32215-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 82</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As for costs of SUM 2193, which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, the Wife argues that although I had dismissed her application, there should be no order as to costs given that she was legally aided.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Here, s 14 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 is relevant. It provides that costs may only be awarded against an aided person in the following two circumstances as set out in s 14(3) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Grant of Aid issued to the aided person has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the aided person acted improperly in bringing or defending any legal proceedings, or in the conduct of those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I find that neither of these two circumstances had been made out. First, there was no suggestion that the Grant of Aid had been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Second, although I had dismissed SUM 2193, this does not mean that the Wife had acted improperly in taking out her application for interrogatories. As Ms Vidthiya had explained during the hearing before me, the Wife had posed those interrogatories because she wanted to know “why the Husband had these debts”. She did not want a situation where the Husband “incur[red] debts and shirk[ed] his responsibility to provide for the children: <em>XCL v XCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a> at [18].

After hearing the parties, I ordered the Respondent to pay to the Complainant spousal maintenance of $2,840 per month but declined to grant any backdated maintenance. The Respondent has since appealed against my decision. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       At the time of the trial on 29 May 2024, the Complainant was 30 years old and the Respondent was 35 years old. The Complainant was unemployed, while the Respondent worked as an Assistant Professor at a local university (the “University”). The parties married in India on 4 August 2019. There are no children to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the marriage, the Respondent worked in Singapore while the Complainant continued living in India, studying for her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Chemical Biology. The Complainant moved to Singapore to live with the Respondent sometime in October 2022. Parties thereafter lived together in an apartment provided by the University that was located in an on-campus residential estate (the “University Apartment”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime on or around 20 December 2023, parties travelled to India together. The Complainant returned to Singapore on 31 December 2023, while the Respondent returned on 11 January 2024. After the Complainant returned, she did not return to the University Apartment, and the parties have been separated since. While the Respondent continued to reside in the University Apartment, the Complainant stayed with friends until sometime in February 2024. She also travelled back to India for a period in between.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Complainant filed this application on 19 February 2024, seeking maintenance for herself. Since then, and as at the time of the trial, the Complainant lived in a shelter at a location she said she was not at liberty to disclose. She said that she was allowed to stay there for a period of three months, which was almost over by the time I first heard the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The applicable legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Complainant’s application was made under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “Charter”). Under s 69(1) of the Charter, the court may make a maintenance order in favour of a married woman where her husband has proven to have neglected or refused to provide her with reasonable maintenance. In making its determination, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the applicable factors set out at s 69(4) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As there are currently divorce proceedings underway, the maintenance order sought in this application is inherently interim in nature. The objective of such interim maintenance is to tide the complainant over while the divorce proceedings are in progress (<em>AXM v AXO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0705.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 705</a> (“<em>AXM</em>”) at [16]). Where there are pending divorce proceedings, the court will adopt a broad-brush approach in assessing the immediate needs of the complainant, since the issue of what maintenance she should eventually be entitled to will be revisited at the final hearing of the ancillary matters (<em>WGD v WGC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28744-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 69</a> at [30]), where the court is better placed to investigate the full facts of the case (see <em>AXM</em> at [13(c)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Complainant’s primary position was that the Respondent should pay her a lump sum maintenance of $359,628. The Complainant said that this amount was calculated using her estimated monthly expenses of $5,500 per month as the multiplicand and the number of months of the marriage as the multiplier, less the cost of accommodation for the 14-month period she resided with the Respondent, and less the total amount of monies the Respondent had paid her during the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Complainant’s secondary ask was that the Respondent provides her with accommodation, plus a monthly sum of $2,000. If the Respondent does not provide her with accommodation, then she sought a monthly sum of $5,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Complainant said that she required this maintenance until she finds a job that would pay her enough to sustain her lifestyle<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Respondent’s position was that the sum of $400 per month, which he has been paying to the Complainant since February 2024, is sufficient for her maintenance. The Respondent was of the view that the Complainant should return to live in India, and reasoned that this sum of $400 would be sufficient to sustain her living expenses there<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the Complainant’s reasonable expenses be calculated based on her expenses in Singapore or in India?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant claimed that her personal expenses amounted to $5,642 per month. This was based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore, where she was residing as at the time of the trial. The Respondent argued that there was no reason why the Complainant should continue residing in Singapore, and that she should return to India. The Respondent believed that it would be easier for the Complainant to find a job in India and that she has only chosen to remain in Singapore to obtain a higher maintenance amount from the Respondent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. As such, the Respondent posited that any maintenance ordered should be based on the Complainant’s expenses in India, which would be significantly lower than her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was not disputed that the Complainant’s expenses in India would be much lower than her expenses in Singapore. After all, the Complainant had previously sustained herself and her widowed mother in India without any contribution from the Respondent and only with an income equivalent to $650 per month, which she received from her fellowship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. However, this fact alone is not reason why the Complainant must return to India to live.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, it is not unreasonable for the Complainant to remain in Singapore, at least pending the conclusion of the parties’ divorce proceedings. The Respondent argues that the Complainant has no family and no connection to Singapore, but this is not entirely accurate: her husband, the Respondent, continues to live and work in Singapore. While divorce proceedings are underway, the interim judgment had not yet been granted as at the time of trial. The Complainant had moved to Singapore in October 2022, ostensibly because the parties had decided that this was where they wanted to reside in together for the next phase of their married lives. There was no suggestion, nor was there any evidence, that this was a temporary move. It is a fact that this was where the parties had lived out the most recent years of their marriage, and the fact of the matter is that as at the time of the trial, the Complainant continued to live in Singapore with no evidence of any plans to move back to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, I am of the view that the Complainant is entitled to defend the divorce proceedings brought by the Respondent in the manner that she deems fit. Just because she had lawyers acting for her in the divorce (as at the time of the trial) does not necessarily mean that this will be the case throughout the course of the proceedings. It is unclear what the scope of her counsel’s engagement was, or if she would have the financial resources to continue to fund this engagement if the divorce proceedings were to drag on. Further, apart from this application which the Complainant took out and litigated on her own, there are various court events that may require the Complainant’s physical attendance, even if she continues to be represented by counsel; a contested divorce trial is one such example, and any future maintenance enforcement proceedings is another. There may also be occasions where parties are required to attend mediation and counselling in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore find that the Complainant is entitled to remain in Singapore, subject to the relevant immigration requirements and regulations. This does not necessarily plant the Complainant’s feet in Singapore, nor does it cast the Respondent’s obligations in stone; in the event that the Complainant does return to India, the parties may seek a variation of any maintenance orders as necessary. However, I did not find it appropriate at this juncture to peg the Complainant’s expenses to the cost of living in India, which may unwittingly force her to return to India, thereby placing her at a possible disadvantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I consequently found it appropriate to assess the Complainant’s reasonable expenses based on the cost of her expenses in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Complainant’s expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     With the above in mind, I set out in the following table the monthly expenses that the Complainant claimed to incur<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, as well as my decision on them, taking into account the Respondent’s arguments with respect to the Complainant’s expenses:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"21.1357728454309%\"><col width=\"23.2953409318136%\"><col width=\"14.5170965806839%\"><col width=\"41.0517896420716%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Item</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Complainant’s position</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Decision</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>My reasons</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Rent</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2,900</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,800</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I elaborate on my reasons at paragraph 19 below. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Utilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">120</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">This was not substantiated but was not specifically contested by the Respondent.

To explain and elaborate further on my findings with respect to the Complainant’s rental expenses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Complainant was living in a shelter and was only allowed to stay there for 3 months. Even if an extension of her stay was permitted by the shelter, I did not find this to be a sustainable living arrangement for her, and certainly not one that was commensurate with the parties’ standard of living during the marriage. I therefore found it reasonable for her to seek suitable accommodation elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In support of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 for rental expenses, the Complainant provided a screenshot of some WhatsApp messages from one ‘Jeviar House’<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, which purported to be a conversation with a property agent that she had in March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. These messages indicated that the cost of renting a one bedroom and one bathroom fully-furnished HDB unit at 119 Bukit Merah View was $2,900. The Complainant said that she was open to living in cheaper accommodation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, and considered renting a bedroom in a shared apartment. However, the unit that she found at a cost of $1,500 per month required her to share the apartment (which was a HDB flat in Jurong) with a male tenant, which she was not comfortable with. She therefore did not follow up on this<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I found the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month to be on the high side. I found it hard to believe that the Complainant was unable to find accommodation in Singapore that would cost her less than $2,900 per month, especially since she was open to renting a bedroom in a shared residence. The Complainant also did not provide any evidence showing her efforts made to find alternative accommodation, apart from the abovementioned WhatsApp messages. I further note that the Complainant never provided the listing for the unit at 119 Bukit Merah View, which would have shown the full details of this property. However, from the preview of this listing as can be seen in the messages provided, it appears that this was for the rental of an entire HDB 3-room flat, which would explain the higher monthly rental cost of $2,900.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the other hand, while the Respondent contested the reasonableness of the Complainant’s estimate of $2,900 per month, he did not provide any evidence showing the cost of alternative accommodation. The Respondent only asserted that this should be around $1,100, which was an amount he surmised based on his conversations with his interns at the University<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent also never questioned the Complainant’s evidence that renting a room in a shared apartment in Jurong would have cost her $1,500, nor did the Respondent make any submission to suggest that this was an unduly high amount for a room in a shared apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I therefore found that the sum of $1,800, which is slightly more than the sum of $1,500 that the Complainant said she was previously quoted for a shared apartment in Jurong, would be reasonable and sufficient for the Complainant to find a suitable accommodation for herself. In arriving at this conclusion, I also considered that the Complainant may have a more limited pool of options to choose from given the availability of female-only shared residences (which I did not find to be an unreasonable preference on her part) as well as the difficulties that the Complainant may face in actually securing an accommodation because of her uncertain immigration status.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The parties income and financial resources</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established that the Complainant’s reasonable expenses amount to $2,841 per month, I turn to assess the parties’ incomes and financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Before moving from India to Singapore, the Complainant received an allowance equivalent to about $650 per month from her fellowship. The Complainant has a PhD and, by her own account, was hopeful of obtaining a job in Singapore that would pay her about $5,000 to $6,000 per month. The Complainant said that she had been looking for post-graduate positions and applying for jobs. She had even attended interviews in August 2023 and in January 2024. By all accounts, the Complainant had the inclination to work and appears to possess the requisite qualifications to find a decent job. However, the reality of the situation is that the Complainant has never worked in Singapore and that she remained unemployed as at the date of the trial. Given the Complainant’s circumstances including the nebulous nature of her immigration situation, I found it hard to say if and when the Complainant would be able to gain employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Further, there was limited evidence before me on the financial resources available to the Complainant, save for some bank statements disclosed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, which revealed that her savings in Singapore and India total no more than the equivalent of $8,000 as at April 2024. There was nothing to suggest that the Complainant was in possession of undisclosed financial resources that would be able to tide her through the proceedings notwithstanding her state of unemployment, and the Respondent never made any assertions or submissions to this effect. I therefore accepted that the Wife was not in a position to pay for her reasonable monthly expenses in this interim period without contribution from the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In contrast to the Complainant’s financial situation, the Respondent earned a substantial income and had significant financial assets to his name. The Respondent’s own evidence was that he earned an average of $14,676 a month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. His IRAS Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2024 showed that he received a total of $217,550 from his employment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, which translates to about $18,130 per month. Based on his declaration in his Electronic Template Statement (“ETS”), the value of his bank accounts and fixed deposits alone total over $360,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Respondent, to his credit, candidly stated at trial that he could technically afford the monthly maintenance amount sought by the Complainant (of $5,000 per month)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. This cohered with my assessment of his financial means and his expenses. The Respondent’s personal expenses, as declared in his ETS, amount to $4,656.06 per month. I found that he was more than able to afford both the Complainant’s claimed maintenance amount and his own expenses, even if I were to take his stated expenses at face value without conducting a full analysis of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the circumstances as set out above, I ordered that <u>the Respondent shall pay to the Complainant a sum of $2,840 per month (rounded down) to the Complainant as her maintenance, payable on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month, starting from 21 June 2024</u>. It was evident from the disparity in quantum between the amount I had assessed as the Complainant’s reasonable expenses ($2,841) and the amount that the Respondent had been paying to the Complainant each month ($400) that the Respondent’s contributions have been insufficient. I found that this was not out of ignorance on the Respondent’s part, as the Respondent was patently aware of his obligations and had voluntarily transferred to the Complainant a sum of $400 per month, or for want of communication on the Complainant’s end, as the Complainant had sent an email to the Respondent on 4 January 2024, specifically requesting that he provided her with shelter and financial support<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Rather, this appears to have been premised on the Respondent’s view that the Complainant should return to India, which I found was not a fair and reasonable view to hold in the circumstances. I therefore found on the facts that the Respondent had indeed neglected to provide the Complainant with reasonable maintenance, and that a maintenance order in the Complainant’s favour was warranted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I declined to order the lump sum maintenance of $359,628 sought by the Complainant at this stage. The Complainant’s request stemmed from her belief that the Respondent should have provided but did not provide her with maintenance from the beginning of the marriage. However, prior to moving from Singapore to Osaka in October 2022, the Complainant was voluntarily living in India and earning an allowance. After moving to Singapore, she moved in to stay with the Respondent in the University Apartment, where they lived as a couple and even went on various overseas trips together, which the Complainant did not have to pay for. There was no evidence of her being in lack, nor was there any evidence of the Complainant seeking monies from the Respondent. I therefore did not find that the Complainant had proven her case in this regard, and in any case, I did not deem this to be an appropriate or justifiable mode of payment in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the same reason, I also declined the Complainant’s request for backdated maintenance for the period prior to January 2024. For the period thereafter, the Complainant stayed with friends, returned to India for some time, and lived in a shelter. She had sufficient funds to subsist during this period and did not incur any accommodation expenses during this period. During the Complainant’s stay in the shelter, most, if not all, of her daily needs were provided for. Taking into account the fact that the Respondent had made some voluntary payments during this period where her expenditure was reduced, I found that an order for backdated maintenance was not justified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Neither party sought costs against the other. I accordingly made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 29 May 2024 (“NE1”), p 52 lines 3-20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>NE1, p 8 lines 1-3</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE1, p 62 lines 15-19</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE1, p83 lines 16-20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE1, p 105 lines 2-5</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE1, p 14 lines 10-29</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>The Complainant’s documents as compiled into a bundle (by the Respondent’s counsel) that was tendered at the start of the trial on 29 May 2024 (“C1”), p 17-19</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>NE1, p70 lines 2-6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>NE1, p 91 line 29 – p 93 line 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE1, p 68 lines 23-24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>NE1, p 69 lines 5-11</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE1, p 70 lines 9-12</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>C1, p 47</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>NE1, p 31 lines 5-14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>NE1, p 33 lines 23 – p 34 line 1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>NE1, p 67 lines 15-27</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>NE1, p 93 lines 30 to p 94 lines 8</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>C1, p 27-31, 41-45</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>NE1, p 83 lines 11-12</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>The Respondent’s documents as compiled into a bundle that was tendered at the start of the trial on 29 May 2024 (“R1”), p 33</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>R1, p 8-9</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>NE1, p 15-31</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>This email dated 4 January 2024, along with a letter from the Respondent’s solicitors to the Complainant dated 11 January 2024, were filed by the Complainant on iFAMS on 23 April 2024.

My substantive decision can be found in <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32204-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 77</a>. This is my decision on the costs of SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife had, in her submission on costs, tabulated the sums incurred from the commencement of divorce to date. This includes sums for things such as her lost wages for January to September 2024. The total sum comes in at $33,400. The Wife, however, has not stated, in her submissions, whether she should be entitled to costs of SUM 1769, nor has she stated her position as to the quantum of such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband, on the other hand, submitted that costs should be awarded in his favour, fixed at $1,279.68 (all in). The costs that the Husband is seeking covers, amongst other things, his disbursements incurred in obtaining the various bank statements which he had disclosed in his reply affidavit to SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Where costs are concerned, it is trite that costs follow the event – in other words, the party who has succeeded in the proceedings is entitled to costs. That said, the court can depart from this starting point, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. It also bears noting that in family proceedings, the court may make no order as to costs with a view towards minimising acrimony and discontent between the parties: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, it is the Husband who is entitled to costs. This is because he had succeeded in resisting the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories – the Wife did not obtain orders in respect of the majority of the items that she sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In fixing the quantum of costs, I take into account the number of items that the Wife had sought in respect of her application for discovery and interrogatories. I also take into account the fact that some of the items which the Wife had asked for in SUM 1769 had not been raised in her earlier requests for discovery or interrogatories (“RFDIs”). This meant that the Husband never had the opportunity to provide voluntary disclosure. I do not take into account the disbursements which the Husband had incurred in giving discovery of the documents sought – after all, the “costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery”: <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Costs are, in the circumstances, fixed at $1,500 (all-in).

It would make no sense for her solicitors to inspect a copy of the Loan Agreement which had already been provided in the DAOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife believes that the Loan Agreement and its authenticity and veracity are relevant and necessary for disposing fairly of the matter. The alleged loan of close to $1.15 million stated in the Loan Agreement forms a substantial portion of the Husband’s alleged indirect contributions towards the matrimonial home. It will have to be determined if the Loan Agreement is a genuine document, or simply an afterthought, drafted and signed by the Husband and his mother once divorce proceedings were likely, to preserve a larger share of asset for the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Given the importance of the Loan Agreement and the huge impact it could have on the case, the Wife does not believe that the Husband has misplaced the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Further, the Wife says that the Husband had previously given her a coloured-version of the same Loan Agreement. She believes that that Husband’s excuse that he has misplaced the Loan Agreement is a convenient excuse to avoid a forensic testing of the original document. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband does not dispute that the Loan Agreement is significant and relevant. In his Reply Affidavit, the Husband says that the Loan Agreement is documentary evidence of the substantial portion of his direct financial contributions towards the matrimonial home and will certainly have a bearing on the determination of the division of the matrimonial home. It is an authentic document which he would be relying on in the ancillary matters hearing. Similarly, his mother would be relying on the Loan Agreement for the return of the monies to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband says that the monies extended under the Loan Agreement were meant to be a loan to him and not a gift.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> He explains as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to Paragraph 13 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit, I would reiterate that the Plaintiff and I were physically in the US, in the State of California then. The Loan Agreement was signed sometime in or around July/August 2016 after our return to Singapore. There was never any denial that my mother and I had decided to backdate the Loan Agreement to 27 February 2016 as it was a day after the last date that the last cheques were dated. We had felt that doing so would be an accurate representation of the agreement. If the Plaintiff had needed to know details like these, she could have requested for them when parties were exchanging the various Requests for Interrogatories and Discovery, which were followed by several rounds of exchanges of clarifications. There is no discrepancy whatsoever as untruthfully alleged by the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Husband says that he was working off a copy of the Loan Agreement for his DAOM. When asked by the Wife’s solicitors to produce the original copy for forensic examination, he did not know that the original copy of the Loan Agreement was already lost at that point in time. He had thought that it was kept somewhere and could be located.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> It was only when he attempted to look for the original copy of the Loan Agreement that he realised that it was lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband says that notwithstanding that the Wife had been informed that he did not have the original of the Loan Agreement, the Wife proceeded to serve on him the NP.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In compliance with the said notice, his solicitors were compelled to serve the NI on the Wife, essentially stating that a copy of the Loan Agreement could be inspected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, no one turned up at his solicitors’ office for the inspection.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> His solicitors immediately followed up with an email dated 28 March 2024 to put on record the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We refer to the above matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We wish to put on record the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Vide your letters dated 12 and 13 March 2024, your client had requested for a forensic examination of the Agreement for Personal Loan exhibited at Page 148 of our client’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 1 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">1.    Our client’s reply vide our email dated 20 March 2024 informed you that our client was <u>unable to locate the original of the document</u> requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    Despite the same, your client proceeded to serve our client with a Notice to Produce Documents Referred To In Pleadings or Affidavits on 21 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.    Our client’s Notice of Where Documents May Be Inspected was then served on you on 25 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">4.    The date of inspection was scheduled on 28 March 2024 between the hours of 10 am and 11 am at our office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">5.    However, the inspection did not take place as no one from your good office turned up at our office.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">6.    There was no courtesy of an email to inform us of your client’s instructions to abort the inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">7.    Time has been unnecessarily wasted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">8.    Our client’s rights are hereby reserved, including but not limited to asking for costs of today’s aborted inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband says that there was no suggestion that he was objecting to producing the original Loan Agreement for inspection as alleged by the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> As he had stated clearly in his solicitors’ email dated 20 March 2024 that the original was lost,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> the Wife ought not to have proceeded to serve on him the NP.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband reiterates as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the Plaintiff is entitled to her beliefs, which in this case, I would say is wholly unsubstantiated. However, the truth of the matter and as I have reiterated, is that the ORIGINAL of the Loan Agreement cannot be found. It is worth noting that the document was made some eight (8) years ago. With the passage of time, the ORIGINAL document had unfortunately been misplaced and cannot be found. We do not know when the ORIGINAL copy was misplaced over the past eight (8) years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I would reiterate that when I instructed my solicitor to write to the Plaintiff’s solicitors, the first and foremost concerns I had amongst others, were the Plaintiff’s intention and purpose of obtaining the Loan Agreement for a forensic examination and how the chain of custody of the document would be maintained, all of which were valid concerns, if the said document was to be handed to the Plaintiff. I was trying to locate the ORIGINAL Loan Agreement then and did not know that the ORIGINAL was already lost at that point in time. I was working off a copy of the Loan Agreement for my Affidavit of Assets and Means. I had only realized that the ORIGINAL of the Loan Agreement was lost when my attempts to find it, failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband contends that this was not a case where he had offered inspection of a copy instead of an original document, which defeated the purpose of inspection. Rather, it was the Wife who ought not to have taken out and served the NI on the Husband when she was aware and had knowledge that the original of the document was lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s reply</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife says that when she returned from the United States to Singapore by herself for a period of about two weeks in February and March 2016, she viewed the matrimonial home with the Husband’s mother and the agent, without the Husband being present. Throughout the view, the Husband’s mother did not mention at any point in time that she intended to loan monies to them for the purchase of the matrimonial home. This was despite the fact that the Loan Agreement was allegedly backdated to the time when she was in Singapore and viewing the matrimonial home with the Husband’s mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife says that there is a significant discrepancy in the date of the Loan Agreement and the actual date of signing as alleged by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> She did ask for more details in relation to the Loan Agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> but the Husband had been less than forthright about the discrepancy, which gave her significant cause to doubt the veracity and authenticity of the Loan Agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife believes that the Loan Agreement was signed as an afterthought when divorce proceedings were commenced by her sometime in December 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The fact that a loan agreement in respect of a sum of more than $1,100,000.00 can be lost is simply suspect. The Husband only claimed that the document was lost after he realised that he could not avoid a forensic testing of the document, despite raising concerns about the chain of custody.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife says that the NP was clearly with reference to the original Loan Agreement, since there is no point in her solicitors inspecting a copy of a document, with the said copy already being exhibited in the Husband’s DAOM. It would make no sense at all for the Husband to provide inspection of a copy of the Loan Agreement, when the authenticity of the Loan Agreement is in dispute in the first place.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s NI made a mockery of the process of inspection by offering for inspection a copy of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The AR’s decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In granting the Wife’s application via Registrar’s Notice dated 10 June 2024, the AR noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It cannot be seriously disputed that the inspection of the purposed (<em>sic</em>) loan agreement is relevant and necessary, given the quantum of the alleged loan and the dispute over the authenticity of the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Court is unable to accept, at this juncture, the Defendant's claim that the agreement is lost. The Defendant did not provide details on efforts made to locate the agreement; he has only made a bare assertion that it is lost. Further, it is curious that the Defendant claimed that the agreement was lost only after the Plaintiff stated her intention to send the agreement for forensic testing. The backdating of the agreement also appears odd. However, I emphasise that these views are expressed for the purpose of this application only. The Defendant is entitled to adduce further evidence to show that the agreement is lost, and the hearing judge is, of course, not bound by my views.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 19 June 2024, the AR provided supplementary grounds, noting that the application raised the interesting question of the correct approach to adopt when a party who has been served a notice under rule 65 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”) claims that the document is lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The AR was of the view where a party has chosen to refer to a document in an affidavit, the other party is generally entitled to that document, and the Court should be strongly inclined to order production. It is not a pre-requisite for the making of the order that the respondent be in possession, custody or control of the document, although it can be a relevant factor. Where the document is not in the possession, custody or control of the respondent, the respondent must demonstrate reasonable efforts to obtain the documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The AR found that the Wife was <em>prima facie</em> entitled to inspect the Loan Agreement since the Husband had chosen to refer to it in his affidavit. The burden is on the Husband to prove “good cause” why the order cannot be made. The AR found that no “good cause” was shown because the Husband offered nothing more than a bare assertion that the Loan Agreement is lost.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The AR noted as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He has not explained the steps he has taken to locate the agreement. He has not explained where and when it was last seen. He has not explained why he was at one point able to obtain a colour copy of the agreement. Thus, from the evidence, he has made at most “only the lamest of efforts” in obtaining the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The AR was of the view that if a bare assertion that a document is lost can amount to a full defence to an application under rule 66(1) of the FJR, that rule would lose much of its force.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     A judge hearing a Registrar’s Appeal exercises confirmatory jurisdiction, as opposed to appellate jurisdiction. Although I may accord appropriate weight to the AR’s decision, I am not bound by the manner in which he exercised his discretion. This is clear from <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053.xml')\">[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053</a> at [38] where it was held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… A judge in chambers who hears an appeal from the Registrar is entitled to treat the matter as though it came before him for the first time. The judge in chambers in effect exercises confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge’s discretion is in no way fettered by the decision below …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I begin by setting out the applicable rules. Specifically, rule 65 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Inspection of documents in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65.—(1)    A party to an action or matter may at any time serve a notice, in the relevant Form, on any other party in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document, requiring the other party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to produce that document for the inspection of the party giving the notice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to permit the party giving the notice to take copies of the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 7 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice (called in this paragraph the second notice) in the relevant Form —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    stating a time within 7 days after the service of the second notice at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the second notice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Rule 66 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Order for production of documents for inspection</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">66.—(1)    If a party who is served with a notice under rule 65(1) —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fails to serve a notice under rule 65(2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    objects to producing any document for inspection;

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    stating the belief of the deponent that the documents are in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given of them under rule 63 or pursuant to any order made under that rule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Finally, rule 73 of the FJR provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery, inspection and answers to interrogatories to be ordered only if necessary</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">73.    On the hearing of any application for an order under rule 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 or 71, the Court —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    may, if satisfied that discovery, inspection or answers to interrogatories are not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the action or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    must in any case refuse to make such an order, if and so far as the Court is of the opinion that the discovery, inspection or answers to interrogatories are not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     A summary of the above rules, insofar as they are relevant to the present application, is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_1\"></a>1)     A party to an action may at any time serve a notice on any other party in whose affidavit reference is made to any document, to produce that document for inspection: see rule 65(1) FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_2\"></a>2)     If a party who is served with the notice fails to serve a notice under rule 65(2), the party <em>entitled to inspection</em> may make an application to the Court for an order for the production of the document for inspection: see rule 66(1)(a) FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_3\"></a>3)     An order for production will be made only if it is necessary: see rule 66(1) r/w rule 73 FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband contends that the AR erred in citing rule 66(1) as not requiring the respondent to have possession, custody or control of the relevant document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The Husband submits that rule 66(1) is not to be read alone. As rules 63 to 77 apply to all matters involving ancillary or financial relief, the rules must be read in their entirety. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband points out that rules 63(1)(a) and (b) specifically require the Court to first determine whether the document described in the application had been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, and if it was in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, then to exhibit a copy of the document in the affidavit, and if not in the respondent’s possession, custody or power, to state when he parted with it and what has become of it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Husband contends that the AR erred under rule 63 in not making an order requiring the Husband to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified in the application satisfied rules 63(1)(a) and 63(1)(b)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and instead proceeded to grant an order-in-terms of the Wife’s application without considering the affidavit, which the Husband ought to have been ordered to file.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The Husband contends further that the AR erred in any event in not dismissing the Wife’s application since rule 63(2) only required the Court to order a party to exhibit a copy of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Respectfully, I did not find the Husband’s arguments persuasive. It should be noted that the Wife’s application is not an application for discovery under rule 63(1). It is an application for production of document for inspection under rule 66(1). Rules 63(1) and 66(1) are distinct provisions dealing with different types of applications, each with its own requirements. It would be incorrect, as a matter of statutory interpretation, to conflate them by importing the requirements in rule 63(1) into rule 66(1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It is clear from a plain reading of rule 66(1) read with rule 65 that there is no requirement for the respondent to have possession, custody or control of the document. All that is required is that the respondent has made reference to the document in an affidavit. Once that requirement is satisfied, the other party to the action is <em>entitled to inspection</em> of the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     An application under rule 66(1) may be contrasted with an application under rule 66(2). Unlike rule 66(1), rule 66(4) specifically requires that an application for an order under rule 66(2) must be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent that the document is in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given to them under rule 63 or pursuant to any order made under that rule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I note in this regard that a similar approach was adopted in <em>SK Shipping Co Ltd v IOF Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHCR 0014.xml')\">[2012] SGHCR 14</a> (“<em>SK Shipping</em>”), which concerned an application by the defendant, pursuant to, <em>inter alia</em>, O 24 r 11 read with O 24 r 10 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), for the production and/or inspection of documents referred to in the Statement of Claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     O 24 r 10, which is the equivalent of rule 65 of the FJR, provides for the inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits. It states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits (O. 24, r. 10)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    Any party to a cause or matter shall be entitled at any time to serve a notice in Form 40 on any other party in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document requiring him to produce that document for the inspection of the party giving the notice and to permit him to take copies thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 4 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice in Form 41 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the notice, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     O 24 r 11, which is the equivalent of rule 66 of the FJR, states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Order for production for inspection (O. 24, r. 11)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    If a party who is required by Rule 9 to serve such a notice as is therein mentioned or who is served with a notice under Rule 10 (1) —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fails to serve a notice under Rule 9 or, as the case may be, Rule 10 (2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    objects to produce any document for inspection; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    offers inspection at a time or place such that, in the opinion of the Court, it is unreasonable to offer inspection then or, as the case may be,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">then, subject to Rule 13 (1), the Court may, on the application of the party entitled to inspection, make an order in Form 42 for the production of the documents in question for inspection at such time and place, and in such manner, as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to paragraph (1), but subject to Rule 13 (1), the Court may, on the application of any party to a cause or matter, order any other party to permit the party applying to inspect any documents in the possession, custody or power of that other party in respect of which discovery has been given under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    An application for an order under paragraph (2) must be supported by an affidavit specifying or describing the documents of which inspection is sought and stating the belief of the deponent that they are in the possession, custody or power of the other party and that discovery has been given of them under any Rule in this Order or in pursuance of any order made thereunder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As observed by the learned Assistant Registrar Justin Yeo in <em>SK Shipping</em> (at [32]-[33]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    While no Singapore cases were cited to me on this point, the English case of <em>Rafidain Bank</em> is instructive. In <em>Rafidain Bank</em>, it was held that the omission of the requirement of “possession, custody or power” from the equivalent RSC provision was, as a matter of construction and common sense, a “deliberate” one (<em>Rafidain Bank</em> at 1610H). This is because the party who refers to the documents in his pleadings or affidavits does so <em>by choice</em>, and usually because these documents were either essential to his cause of action (or defence), or of significant probative value to him (<em>ibid</em>). These do not presuppose that the said documents would be in that party’s possession, custody or power (<em>ibid</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    The court in <em>Rafidain Bank</em> further emphasised that <b>there was no reason why the broad scope of O 24 rr 10 and 11(1) should be restricted such that an order may only be made pursuant thereto if the documents sought are in the possession, custody or power of the party to whom the order if made is directed (</b><b><em>ibid </em></b><b>at 1613E). This should be contrasted with O 24 r 11(2), which contains the “exceptional restriction” that the making of an order pursuant thereto is dependent on whether the documents sought to be inspected are in the possession, custody or power of the party to whom the order if made is directed (</b><b><em>ibid</em></b><b>).</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In the present case, the Husband has made reference to the Loan Agreement in his DAOM. Pursuant to rule 66(1), the Wife is “entitled to inspection” of the Loan Agreement. In compliance with rule 65(1), the Wife served the NP on the Husband. It is clear from the chronology of events narrated above that the Husband was well aware that the NP was a request to produce the <em>original</em>, and not a <em>copy</em>, of the Loan Agreement for inspection, as a copy of the Loan Agreement had already been exhibited in his DAOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In purported compliance with rule 65(2), the Husband served on the Wife the NI giving notice that a <em>copy</em> of the Loan Agreement may be inspected. As the request by the Wife was for the production of the <em>original</em> Loan Agreement, there was a failure on the part of the Husband to comply with rule 65(2). It bears reiterating that rule 65(2) requires the party on whom a notice to produce a document is served to state whether he objects to the production of the document in question. Hence, the Husband is required to state whether he objects to the production of the <em>original</em> Loan Agreement, which is the document in question. By skirting the issue and giving notice that a <em>copy</em> of the Loan Agreement may be inspected when that was not the document in question, the Husband has failed to comply with rule 65(2). Consequently, the requirement in rule 66(1)(a) of the FJR for the Court to invoke its power to order production is satisfied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband has sought to argue that s 67(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1893 contemplates the situation where the original of a document is lost, but a copy of the said document remains admissible as secondary evidence of its contents. This may explain why rules 62, 63, 65, 66 and 73 of the FJR do not require specifically that an original of the document be produced or inspected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I did not find this persuasive as s 67(1)(c) is an evidential provision. There is nothing in s 67(1)(c) or the rules that limit the right of a party entitled to inspection to inspect only a copy of the original document. Indeed, it would make no sense for any such restriction to be imposed as this would defeat the purpose of the inspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The crux of the matter, as correctly identified by the AR, is the correct approach to be adopted when a party who has been served a notice under rule 65(1) of the FJR, claims that the document is lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband asserts that a copy of the Loan Agreement was in his possession, custody and power but not the original of the said document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> As the original of the document was lost, there cannot be an order to produce the same, as that would put the Husband in a position of impossibility to comply with the order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The issue as to whether the Court is powerless to make an order for production where a party asserts that it lacks possession, custody or power was considered in <em>SK Shipping</em> which observed (at [34]-[38]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… given that the court has discretion <em>vis-à-vis</em> whether or not to grant an order for production under O 24 r 11(1), the absence of possession, custody or power may be a <em>factor</em> taken into consideration in the exercise of such discretion. <b>The absence of possession, custody or power will “sometimes amount to a good cause” not to order production of such documents, but not “invariably” so</b> (<em>Rafidain Bank</em> at 1611B). The court in <em>Rafidain Bank</em> gave, as an example, the case of a “technical” absence of possession, custody or power where there is evidence that the third party who had possession of the document would very likely make it available if only he was asked to do so. The court was of the view that in such a situation, there was no reason that the court should be powerless to make an order for production, despite the respondent’s lack of possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it should be emphasised that in <em>Rafidain Bank</em>, <b>the “technical” lack of possession, custody or power was cited as an </b><b><em>example </em></b><b>(and by no means an </b><b><em>exhaustive </em></b><b>one) in which courts will order production where a party asserts that it lacks possession, custody or power over the documents in question</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is clear from <em>Zida</em> that it is insufficient for the party refusing discovery to demonstrate <b>“only the lamest efforts</b>” in requesting the necessary documents from the relevant third party (<em>Zida</em> at [59]). Where the efforts to obtain the necessary documents are “undistinguished by zeal” (<em>Zida</em> at [55]), the fact that the relevant third party refuses to cooperate is <em>per se</em> insufficient for the party refusing discovery to <b>discharge its onus of showing “good cause”</b> (see <em>Zida</em> at [51]-[59]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In summary, the following principles may be derived. The Court has a discretion whether or not to grant an order for production. The onus is on the party refusing production to show “good cause” why the Court should not order production. The absence of possession, custody or power may be a factor taken into consideration in the exercise of such discretion. It may sometimes amount to a “good cause” but not invariably so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Husband contends that he had affirmed an affidavit stating that the original Loan Agreement was lost, thereby putting himself at risk of perjury if he had lied about the loss of the document.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> However, this begs the question whether the Husband’s affidavit ought to be treated as conclusive. As noted above, the AR did not accept the Husband’s claim that the original Loan Agreement was lost.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In the absence of any case authority directly on point, I find it helpful to derive guidance from an analogous situation in a discovery application. In <em>Lutfi Salim bin Talib v British and Malayan Trustees Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31221-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 85</a>, the defendant appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s order that the defendant produce three categories of documents. One of the issues in the appeal related to the conclusive nature of the defendant’s statement on affidavit that it did not have any further documents in its possession and/or control with respect to two of the categories. Chua Lee Ming J held (at [32]-[33]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    Thus, there is authority that under the previous versions of the Rules of Court, an affidavit in respect of discovery of documents was not conclusive if there was a <em>reasonable suspicion</em> that further discoverable documents existed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    However, in my view, this “reasonable suspicion” test has no place under O 11 r 3 of the ROC 2021. For the purposes of deciding an application under O 11 r 3(1), a respondent’s opposing affidavit and any subsequent affidavits filed in response to a previous order under O 11 rr 3(1) or 3(2) of the ROC 2021 are conclusive and the court should not go behind the affidavits unless it is <em>plain and obvious</em> from the documents that have been produced, the respondent’s affidavits or pleadings, or some other objective evidence before the court, that the requested documents (a) must exist or have existed; (b) must be or have been in the respondent’s possession or control; or (c) are not protected from production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Hence, an affidavit in respect of discovery of documents is not conclusive if there is a “reasonable suspicion” that further discoverable documents existed (under the previous versions of the Rules of Court) or it is “plain and obvious<em>”</em> from the respondent’s affidavits or some other objective evidence before the Court, that the requested documents must be or have been in the respondent’s possession or control (under ROC 2021).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In my view, as the rules of discovery in the FJR were derived from the previous version of the Rules of Court and the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R4), the “reasonable suspicion” test would be the more appropriate test to be adopted for the purpose of the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Having carefully considered the Husband’s Reply Affidavit and the objective evidence before the Court, I found that there is a reasonable suspicion that the original Loan Agreement existed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Firstly, the Loan Agreement was allegedly signed by the Husband, his mother and the property agent in Singapore and the three of them were allegedly present at the same location. It would be odd if none of the parties present was able to recall the location where the agreement was signed. The Husband’s reply, in response to the Wife’s interrogatory as to where parties signed the document, that <em>he</em> is “unable recall the exact location where the agreement was signed”, gives cause for doubt whether he has been forthcoming. This is because the question by the Wife is not whether the Husband is able to recall, but “[w]here parties signed the document”. Even if the Husband is unable to recall as he has asserted, could he not have checked with his mother or the property agent who were present? The ambivalent reply by the Husband leaves open the question whether any attempt was made to check with the others and whether they too, could not recall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Secondly, each of the alleged signatories dated the Loan Agreement as “27/2/2016”. However, the Husband has given evidence that the Loan Agreement was signed in July or August 2016, after he had returned from the United States. On the face of the document, the Loan Agreement is plainly misleading since it was not executed on 27 February 2016. This material discrepancy in the Loan Agreement, discovered as a result of the interrogatories administered by the Wife, highlights the need for evidence relating to the Loan Agreement to be scrutinised with care. However, the evidence provided by the Husband is sorely lacking in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Thirdly, the fact that the Loan Agreement was allegedly executed six months after the loan had already been extended is a suspicious circumstance by itself that warrants a proper explanation. The lack of details provided by the Husband as to how the Loan Agreement came about not only fails to dispel the suspicion but reinforces it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Fourthly, since the purpose of the Loan Agreement is ostensibly for the mother to rely on it for the return of the loan, it would have been obvious to ask whether the mother has the original copy. Notedly, the Husband has merely stated that he is unable to locate the original copy, without saying whether the original was kept by him or his mother, or whether he has checked with his mother, whom, it should be noted, was the one who drafted the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Lastly, it seems too convenient that the Husband only realised that the original document was lost after his solicitors were informed by the Wife’s solicitors that the Wife intended to obtain a forensic examination of the said document to determine the veracity of his claim regarding when the document was signed. While the Husband has explained that he only realised that the original copy of the Loan Agreement was lost after he attempted to look for it, the veracity of his explanation must be assessed against the above backdrop, the importance of the document, and the consequential degree of care one would ordinarily expect in the safekeeping of an important document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     On the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the AR was justified in rejecting the Husband’s claim that the agreement was lost. In my judgment, there is a reasonable suspicion that the Husband is withholding the original copy to avoid a forensic examination of the document. An order for production is clearly necessary given the relevance and significance of the Loan Agreement to the division of the matrimonial home. As the Husband has failed to discharge the burden of proving “good cause”, I was not persuaded to exercise my discretion in his favour not to order production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Finally, I should state for completeness that the Husband has sought to argue in his request for further arguments that he had exhibited not a photocopy of the original hardcopy of the loan agreement, but a printed copy of the softcopy. The Husband says that he should not be obliged to produce the original hardcopy since he was referring in truth to the softcopy. The Husband contends that whether or not the softcopy is authentic will depend on the presumption in s 116A of the Evidence Act in relation to electronic records.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I did not find any merit in this fresh argument. Whether the Husband had exhibited a photocopy of the original hardcopy of the Loan Agreement or a printed copy of a softcopy does not affect the entitlement of the Wife to request for inspection of the original document. The onus is on the Husband to prove that he does not have the original document and has made reasonable efforts to produce the original document, which he has failed to show.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     For the above reasons, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

<p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 836/2024 was the Husband’s application against the Wife for a personal protection order (“PPO”). I heard the trial on 3 September 2024 and dismissed the Husband’s application. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In order to succeed in his application, the Husband had to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an act of family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961, and that it was necessary for the PPO to be granted for his protection: s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961; <em>WNU v WNV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29868-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 18</a> at [10]; see also <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [6] – [14]. For ease of analysis, the definitions of family violence are set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       During the course of the trial, the Wife told me that she wanted to consent to the Husband’s application for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I could not accept this. The Wife had also said, in the same breath, that she wanted to do so out of a desire to get the matter over and done with. She hoped that the Husband would not create problems for her if she gave him what he wanted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There are serious consequences stemming from the grant of a PPO (see <em>CSW v CSX</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 204 at [14] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a>; <em>WNU v WNV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29868-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 18</a> at [6]). I was not satisfied that the Wife fully appreciated this. I therefore proceeded to deal with the matter based on the evidence before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A video was played in court. It had been recorded by the Husband on 3 April 2024. It showed that the Wife had slapped and scolded him. The Wife had also hurled several vulgarities at him, told him to “go kill himself”, and threatened to leave him for another man. The Wife does not dispute having done so in her testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The acts shown in the video speaks for itself. By slapping the Husband, I find that the Wife had committed an act which fell within the definition of limb (b) of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       These acts of family violence complained of stemmed from the problems which the Husband and Wife had encountered in their relationship. It was clear, from their testimony, that they were unable to resolve their conflicts in a healthy and productive manner. This led to frequent arguments which not only gave rise to the incidents of family violence complained of, but also caused the Wife to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is against this backdrop that I assessed the necessity of granting a PPO for the Husband’s protection, and arrived at the conclusion that it was not necessary to make such an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband had testified that he had shifted out on 3 April 2024 and that he is no longer in contact with the Wife. He had also said that they had not been in contact since 22 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife had also given evidence that she wanted to, and had every intention of, cutting the Husband out from her life. She did not want any contact with the Husband. She had blocked him on social media as well as Whatsapp. She wanted nothing else to do with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was clear to me, from the evidence, that neither the Husband, nor the Wife, has a desire to be in contact with the other. They have both set their lives on diverging paths. Given the distance and separation they have created between each other, in what appears to be an attempt to move on, there will be fewer opportunities (if at all) for conflict, which obviates the need for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I therefore dismissed the Husband’s application for a PPO in SS 836/2024 with no order as to costs.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Relocation"],"date":"2024-08-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons Guardianship No 164 of 2023, Originating Summons Guardianship No 38 of 2024","title":"XBE v XBF and another matter","citation":"[2024] SGFC 67","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32219-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Kulvinder Kaur (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Plaintiff/Husband.

They have 3 children B (XX September 2016), aged 7 who will turn 8 this year; D (XX September 2018), aged 5 turning 6 this year and E (XX September 2020), aged 3 turning 4 this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a 41-year-old Indonesian citizen who used to hold Singapore PR status. She discovered through ICA in or about November 2023 that her Singapore PR status was terminated although she had prior approval that this was to continue through for 5 years until May 2028. With effect from September 2022, she resides in Indonesia and works in her family business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant is a 38-year-old Singaporean citizen and is a university lecturer. He was the Managing Director and CEO at XXX International Pte Ltd and worked full-time. He had a change in job profile in October 2023 or thereabouts. He is now a university lecturer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Plaintiff was a fulltime homemaker and stay home mum after the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After the marriage, the parties and the children lived at ET Place with the Defendant’s parents. They had the assistance of domestic helpers. The Defendant’s father used to be a teacher and retired in 2019. The Defendant’s mother is a Senior Nurse and continues to be gainfully employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In December 2021, the Plaintiff said that she rented an apartment at The M and a lease agreement was entered into for a year from January 2022 to January 2023. There was a disagreement as to when the parties moved into The M. The Defendant said March 2022; the Plaintiff said February 2022. There was also a dispute as to why the lease was taken up. The Plaintiff said that the Defendant kicked her out and that he moved in later after they reconciled in February 2022. The Defendant said they were going to move into his apartment in Paterson (The XXX) which was then still being rented out with the lease ending in January, coinciding with the end of the lease at The M. Nevertheless, the parties and the children lived together at The M until 6 August 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant’s parents stayed on at ET Place until this was sold in June 2022. They then moved into The M with the couple whilst awaiting the completion of their new place at The W. However, they then sold The W in July 2022, and they purchased a unit at The XXX, in the same condominium compound as the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Plaintiff and the children left for Indonesia on 6 August 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The children’s stay in Indonesia 6 August 2022 – 31 October 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There is no dispute that the parties went to Bali, Indonesia to attend the Plaintiff’s brother’s wedding scheduled on 29 September 2022. The parties withdrew the 2 older children from their kindergartens so that the children could spend more time with their maternal grandparents and relatives. The Plaintiff and the children flew to Jakarta, and they stayed in Indonesia from 6 August 2022 until an intervening event which will be discussed. They flew to Bali on 25 September 2022 whilst the Defendant arrived on 26 September 2022. The Plaintiff’s brother’s wedding took place in Bali on 29 September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Plaintiff said that the Defendant exhibited violent behavior towards her on 29 September 2022 and that this was witnessed by her father. The Defendant conceded that the parties had an altercation on 29 September 2022, but he said nothing had come out of it. He then discovered that the Plaintiff and the children were missing the next day. He said that the Plaintiff’s father and other family members of the Plaintiff as well as 2 policemen informed him that the Plaintiff and the children would stay on in Indonesia for a while. The Defendant claimed that he had no choice in the matter and returned to Singapore with the parties’ domestic helper. He said he later found out the Plaintiff and the children had flown to Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     What was not disputed was that from end September 2022, the Plaintiff and the children remained in Jakarta, staying with the Plaintiff’s parents. The 2 older children started attending school with the younger child being homeschooled because of his young age. The children were also attending various extra-curricular activities in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant went to Jakarta on various occasions as set out in the Plaintiff’s affidavit. He would spend extended periods with the children of at least 7 days to 14 days in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 31 October 2023 on one such visit, the Defendant removed the children from Jakarta and returned to Singapore. He did not have the children’s passports but was probably assisted with the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta. He has not given details of this to date. The Plaintiff was the one who retrieved the information from the Indonesian Immigration Authorities on 4 November 2024. Since then, the children have remained with the Defendant at The XXX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     On 21 November 2023, the Plaintiff commenced proceedings in Singapore vide OSG164/2023 for the interim sole custody care and control of the children and for the children to be returned or relocated to Jakarta. She commenced divorce proceedings in Jakarta on 30 December 2023. The parties attended a compulsory mediation session on 19 June 2024. The divorce proceedings are live in Indonesia. The Plaintiff informed that the ancillary matters would be dealt with in Indonesia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Defendant cross applied for sole custody care and control of the children in OSG38/2024 on 2 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision – children to be returned to Indonesia and relocation of the children allowed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After reading all the affidavits, considering the documents and hearing the parties, I granted an order for the children to return to Jakarta in Indonesia and to continue to remain there in the care of the Plaintiff. The children are to therefore to be relocated to Indonesia. Consequential orders for access with the Defendant were also dealt with and parties worked out the terms with specific inputs from the Court where there was no agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Defendant’s application was also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Principles of relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The general principles with regards to relocation are stated in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. It is trite law that the welfare of the child is paramount in deciding relocation cases, and this principle ought to override any other consideration. This is dependent on a multitude of factors which may impact what is best for the child’s welfare. It is a fact-centric exercise. The reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver to relocate is also considered as it may affect the child’s welfare, because the child’s emotional and psychological welfare is generally intertwined with that of the primary caregiver. Loss to the child of his or her relationship with the left-behind parent is also an important consideration but it is not of determinative weight in every case. The court is also to consider the child’s wishes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I find that it is in these children’s welfare to be returned to Jakarta and to be relocated to the place where they had stayed with the Plaintiff, their mother for a period of some 13 months before the Defendant’s unilateral removal of the children from Jakarta to Singapore on 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I set out the reasons for my decision taking into account the following factors:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>a)     That the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>b)     The Defendant’s role as a parent before 31 October 2024 and post 31 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>c)     The paternal grandparents’ role did not displace the Plaintiff as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>d)     The Defendant’s care of the children after return to Singapore from 31 October 2023 did not displace the Plaintiff’s role.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>e)     The Defendant consented to the children staying in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_f\"></a>f)     The Defendant had regular contact with the children in Jakarta and there was no loss of relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_g\"></a>g)     The Plaintiff’s caregiving in Jakarta and relocation plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_h\"></a>h)     The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay in Jakarta with the children due to the Defendant’s conduct i.e. the Defendant’s violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_i\"></a>i)     Primary caregiver’s wishes to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_j\"></a>j)     Children’s wishes and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_k\"></a>k)     Loss of parental relationship and claims of alienation</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff is the children’s primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As a starting point, I made a finding that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver save for the period of 31 October 2023 to July 2024 when she was deprived of the children through the Defendant’s actions of 31 October 2023. This period of absence from the children’s lives was involuntary and caused by the intervening event of their removal from the Plaintiff’s care by the Defendant. It did not however mean that she lost her role or that it had been displaced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff’s contributions towards the children’s caregiving as the children’s primary caregiver and a homemaker have been set out in affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     She set the children’s daily routine, taking care of their medical needs and overseeing their health; showering the children, preparing all the children’s meals from purchase of the groceries, to cooking and cleaning up, cutting fruits for them, managing the children’s prams, teaching the children how to walk, getting them ready whenever the parties went out etc. She also encouraged and developed their social development through games and arts and crafts. It is pertinent to note that the Defendant worked fulltime from their births.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When the children remained in Jakarta following the parties’ altercation on 29 September 2022, the Plaintiff continued to be the children’s primary caregiver. She ferried the children to school, was involved in their school life, put them to bed, brushed their teeth, planned their meals etc.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Plaintiff even prepared meals for the Defendant and the children when he visited them in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     More importantly, the Defendant acknowledged in an email dated 3 October 2022 at page 54 of P1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, that the Plaintiff “<em>have done much more than (he) in handling the roles of both a wife and a mother on a full-time basis, at long hours too</em>.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Although they had domestic helpers, the Plaintiff carried out caregiving responsibilities, while the domestic helper focused on household chores. The Plaintiff also produced a WhatsApp chat dated 13 July 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, detailing the domestic helper’s household responsibilities. The WhatsApp chat corroborated her version of events that indeed the domestic helper’s role was confined to household chores whilst the Plaintiff concentrated on caregiving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Having found that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver, it is in their best interests for the children to remain with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I also refer to <b><em>ULA v UKZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22490-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 19</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> in which weight was given to the relocating parent’s desire to relocate. The Court considered the ways that such relocation would benefit her and held that as the relocating parent is the child’s primary caregiver, the child’s happiness and wellbeing are connected to her and cannot be divorced from hers. In the same vein, the Plaintiff herein is the children’s primary caregiver and the three young children’s welfare, and wellbeing are connected with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s role as a parent before 31 October 2024 and post 31 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Notwithstanding the Defendant’s present narrative as to his involvement and that of his parents; whilst important, those efforts were secondary to the primary care the Plaintiff exerted over the care of 3 young children from birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Defendant worked fulltime until he removed the children from Jakarta on 31 October 2023. The Plaintiff gave some contextual background to the Defendant’s work history and said that he was a workaholic<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. He also pursued his post-graduate education in Switzerland sometime around the end of 2019, and the family moved there for his studies. As he was studying, the care of the young children resided with the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Plaintiff’s account of the Defendant’s lack of time with the family to the extent of only spending minutes a day was also supported by the Plaintiff’s exhibits of WhatsApp messages to her in-laws in October 2019 and in June 2020. He watched videos on YouTube and played online games to the extent that the Plaintiff asked for help from her in-laws to speak with the Defendant for help with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Defendant also did not want to sleep with the Plaintiff and the children at home, as he said they were noisy. The Plaintiff had to convert the Defendant’s study room into a bedroom for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Plaintiff also submitted that the Defendant made personal trips without the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In the circumstances, the Defendant’s account of his caregiving must be considered contextually and against the facts of this case. His narration of his detailed caregiving of the children only occurred after 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The paternal grandparents’ role did not displace the Plaintiff as the primary caregiver </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the paternal grandparents, B was born in 2016 but the paternal grandfather retired from his fulltime job only in 2019 some 3 years later. D was born in 2018. The Defendant and his parents thus worked fulltime until the paternal grandfather’s retirement in 2019. The paternal grandmother continues to hold down a fulltime job. The primary care of the three young children was left to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Defendant said the paternal grandfather assisted in caregiving and pointed out to some ferrying of the children as well as text messages from the paternal grandmother giving tips to the Plaintiff on how to care for one of the children who was ill. He also submitted that the parties had the assistance of domestic helpers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The paternal grandparents might have supported the care of the 3 children but their roles could not be considered primary caregiving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Whilst the Defendant submitted that that his parents “heavily assisted” with taking care of the children, there was no evidence of this before 31 October 2023. The Defendant repeated in various WhatsApp messages that his parents were elderly and, “...<em>aged a lot and health deteriorated</em>”, and his father’s latest audio report stated that he had severe hearing loss<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The Defendant’s father suffered chronic chest pains and was admitted to hospital, as stated in the Defendant’s WhatsApp message dated 29 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I have no doubt that the paternal grandparents love the grandchildren and supported the Plaintiff and Defendant as much as they could but it could not be said that the paternal grandparents were the children’s caregivers. I find that the role rested with the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Defendant’s care of the children after return to Singapore from 31 October 2023 did not displace the Plaintiff’s role</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Since the children’s abduction by the Defendant from Jakarta, the Defendant claimed that the children have a new routine. He claimed that he is a hands-on father and he referred to the affidavits from the Chinese tuition teacher and a friend to support this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As set out earlier, this routine was created by the Defendant when he abducted the children from Jakarta. He then started the children on formal schooling for B and other classes for the two other children. He claimed to have resumed his caregiving role and he also left his regular job to become a stay home father, working as a lecturer with limited hours of teaching.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I did not agree with this narrative as the Defendant abducted the children and removed them from the Plaintiff’s care. The children had lived with the Plaintiff in Jakarta from 29 September 2022. His removal of the children from Jakarta on 31 October 2022 and retaining them with him in Singapore did not transform him to be their primary caregiver especially when he retained them without the Plaintiff’s consent or prior knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Plaintiff pointed out that there had been delays in the proceeding caused by the Defendant filing his reply affidavit and cross application only in April 2024. The Defendant claimed that parties were negotiating and that he only requested one extension of time. However, for various reasons, his affidavit and various applications were only filed in April 2024. This was 5 months after the Plaintiff’s application. By the time this matter came for final hearing, 7-8 months had passed. The Defendant should not take advantage of this by claiming that the children have a new routine when this was caused by his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I also did not see this “routine” as insurmountable; the comparison was not timeframes in which the children were in Jakarta <em>vis-a-vis</em> timeframes in Singapore. The starting point is that the Plaintiff is the children’s primary caregiver. The children were removed from her care. They were then put into a new routine which I found to be artificially created by the Defendant. Their removal from their primary caregiver was also not in their best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In fact, the Defendant has not provided any evidence that he was/is the primary caregiver from their birth. The Defendant, his domestic helper and his parents did not displace the Plaintiff as the children’s primary care giver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Defendant had a tuition teacher, Chen XXX filed an affidavit on April 2024 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>about his caregiving. It is pertinent to note that she did not refer to the Defendant’s mother being at home which was consistent with the fact that the Defendant’s mother continued to work. Chen XXX set out in affidavit that she met the Defendant in January 2024. She filed the affidavit in April 2024 and made general statements that the Defendant was invested in the children’s studies. I placed little weight on her affidavit as this was commissioned by the Defendant to garner support for his case; she was the tutor for a short span of time which coincided with the Defendant’s claim of a new “routine” for the children; her statements were general, and she was in no position to have compared the Plaintiff’s care with the Defendant’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Defendant also had a friend (R) file an affidavit on 17 April 2024 about what a hands-on father he was. However, the affidavit was unhelpful as the said friend interacted with the Defendant only when the children had play dates. The friend concluded that the Defendant was a good father because he discussed education syllabus with him. The friend was not able to expand on more than that. I did not place weight on the evidence regarding the Defendant being the children’s primary caregiver given the limited content of the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Plaintiff also submitted there that the Defendant and/or his domestic helper and/or parents were negligent <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>with the children’s care. I did not place too much weight on this as parties would tend to overstate their positions in the advancement of their case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The pertinent point to note is that the Plaintiff was/is the children’s primary caregiver and the separation of mother and children was caused by the Defendant’s intervening act of removing them from her. His attempts to build a narrative as the children’s primary caregiver must be taken in context of his fulltime job (before 31 October 2023), the Plaintiff’s primary role, and the other matters that are set out here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant consented to the children staying in Jakarta</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I also find that the Defendant consented to the children remaining in Jakarta. The Plaintiff’s decision to remain in Jakarta stemmed from incidents in the marriage (elaborated further below) in which he told the Plaintiff that she could take the children and return to Jakarta if he was violent again. This was corroborated by the video recording produced by the Plaintiff in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     From the Defendant’s text messages and emails, he accepted that the children would live in Jakarta. He also told the Plaintiff to enroll the children in an international school in Jakarta; corroborated in text messages between the parties and his subsequent actions. He visited the children’s school in Jakarta and participated in events when invited by the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     His messages to the Plaintiff of 12 September 2023 were reproduced in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“... I will be going over next week Thursday and spend time with you and our children. I hope we can stay together and I’m willing to live there with you all. Let’s discuss? ...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(text message from the Defendant on 20 January 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“If you think being in Indonesia is better, let’s discuss it as long as we can be together as a family.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(text message from the Defendant on 19 March 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“... Kindly give our children and family a chance in Jakarta.” (text message from the Defendant on 2 July 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Let us restart (if you insist in Jakarta) for our children and family.” (text message from the Defendant on 9 August 2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Dearest, I beg you to please let our family reunite. I’m willing to move to Jakarta. ...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Defendant also stated in his email of 9 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“I have done everything I can and am really at my wit’s end on how to salvage our dear family. My last solution is to go to you, leave Singapore and live with you and our children in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please kindly give me the 1<sup>st</sup> and last chance at trying a new life for our family IN JAKARTA. I will support you in whatever you wish to do.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In <b><em>TUC v TUD</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20876-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 877</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, the High Court discussed a parent’s consent to relocate in the context of Section 13(a) of the Hague Convention. The High Court stated that there must be proof on the balance of probabilities that the left-behind parent consented to the child being removed to or retained in a different country. Although this is not a case under the Hague Convention, I find that the principles are relevant, and that the Defendant’s words and conduct indicated a clear consent for the children to live in Jakarta. The fact that the Plaintiff and the children stayed on in Jakarta for 13 months also evidenced this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In <b><em>VMY v VMZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25265-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 94</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Court ordered that the father be permitted to relocate with the children to the United Kingdom and have care and control of the children. In the case, there was an email in 2019 where the mother confirmed that she was agreeable to the children relocating in the summer of 2021. The children attended classes to prepare for grammar school in the United Kingdom and in contemplation of the children moving to an international school which followed the United Kingdom school curriculum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In this present fact situation, the Defendant’s conduct and messages confirmed his consent. The Defendant did not refute these messages. He even suggested that he would relocate to Jakarta to be with the Plaintiff and the children. He also went to Jakarta and spent extended time with the children (discussed below). I find there was no ambiguity in what the Defendant said and that he meant what was said. The Defendant did not address these messages and emails in his replies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant had regular contact with the children in Jakarta</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Although counsel submitted that the Defendant was unsure of whether he would have contact or access with the children each time he went to Jakarta, it was undisputed that the Defendant saw the children. The Defendant had no issues travelling to Jakarta on various occasions for access as set out <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>a)     27 January 2023 to 5 February 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>b)     8 April 2023 to 9 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>c)     12 April 2023 to 13 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>d)     14 April 2023 to 15 April 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_e\"></a>e)     20 May 2023 to 21 May 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_f\"></a>f)     26 May 2023 to 28 May 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_g\"></a>g)     24 June 2023 to 26 June 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_h\"></a>h)     28 June 2023 to 2 July 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_i\"></a>i)     3 August 2023 to 14 August 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_j\"></a>j)     15 September 2023 to 18 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_k\"></a>k)     22 September 2023 to 28 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_l\"></a>l)     25 October 2023 to 31 October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Plaintiff also offered the Defendant undisturbed phone calls with the children twice a week<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. This was corroborated by the Defendant at paragraph 32 of D1 and his parents were also present at the weekly video calls<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. He sent an email on 9 May 2023 that he had access to the children when he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“</em>In the meantime, I am to continue the current routine of seeing our children (B, D and E) in Jakarta as often as I can every month or so, and kindly continue to video call my parent and I during every Wednesday and Saturday at 7pm (SGT) / 6pm (JKT) so we can talk with and see the children.”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     On the evidence, the video calls commenced 2 days after the Plaintiff and the children stayed in Jakarta.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     There is no concern that the Defendant would be deprived of contact with the children when they relocate to Jakarta. The Defendant in his own messages stated that was to “continue the current routine” of seeing the children as often as he could, every month or so. The dates listed in paragraph 59 also showed that he did have access to the children regularly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff’s caregiving in Jakarta and viable relocation plan</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     On the other hand, the Plaintiff continued her role as the children’s primary caregiver when they lived in Jakarta from 29 September 2022 to 31 October 2023. She can continue her role once the children return to her. The children’s care should not be substituted with a domestic helper or grandparents, especially if a parent is readily available to be with the children. This is one such case in which the Plaintiff would be continuing her caregiving of her three young children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As for a relocation plan, this was not an issue as the children lived in Jakarta and were attending school/classes there for 13 months. This was not the usual relocation case in which one parent questioned the viability of a relocation plan. The children already lived in Jakarta for more than a year before their removal by the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The children lived with the Plaintiff and their grandparents at Apartment XXX Indonesia. The Plaintiff had assistance from her parents although she said this was required. She also had the assistance of domestic helpers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The children attended school in Jakarta at XXX de Jakarta since November 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The children attended various extra-curricular activities and tuition classes in Jakarta. B attended gym sessions, taekwondo, wushu martial arts, ice skating, artistic swimming classes, baking and cooking classes, painting, paddle, singing classes, Chinese and French lessons. D attended gym, taekwondo, wushu martial arts, Chinese lessons, and piano lessons. The Plaintiff has exhibited numerous photographs of the children which were taken in Jakarta<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. E was home schooled by the Plaintiff in Jakarta as he was only slightly over 2 years old then<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Plaintiff purchased insurance in Jakarta. She brought them for regular medical and dental checkups when the children lived in Jakarta. Copies of the policies were exhibited<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Plaintiff has an extensive extended family in Jakarta, whom the children are familiar with, including cousins, aunts, uncles, and their grandparents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I also address the Defendant’s submission that that there was a lack of contact between the Plaintiff’s parents and the children when the children lived in Singapore before August 2022. The Plaintiff denied this allegation as her parents visited Singapore about 4 times from B’s birth. Her sisters visited Singapore several times. The children also visited Jakarta with the Plaintiff on numerous occasions and met up with her extended family and the children are not unfamiliar with their maternal grandparents. In any event, I did not see this as a concern as the children have lived with the maternal grandparents for 13 months and had been meeting with their aunts, uncles and cousins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     On the other hand, the children do not have any cousins or any other extended family members from the Plaintiff’s side of the family in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Upon the children’s return, they would continue with their stay at the Plaintiff’s parent’s home and they would return to their routine of 13 months before they were wrested from the Plaintiff’s care. They would be looked after by their mother, their primary caregiver. There was no real concern about a viable relocation plan as the children lived in Jakarta. They had a life in Jakarta and they would be returning to that life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay in Jakarta with the children – the Defendant’s voice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Plaintiff had good reasons to stay on in Jakarta with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     She had a legitimate concern about the Defendant’s issue of anger and violence. He has also been caught on recordings bad-mouthing the Plaintiff to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     During the marriage, the Plaintiff had been subjected to the Defendant’s violent behavior. She suffered multiple wrist and back injuries and produced a TCM report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>: The Defendant had been physically violent to the Plaintiff even when she was 7 months pregnant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. He admitted to abusing the Plaintiff as seen from the Plaintiff’s video recording dated 21 July 2019’. He had choked the Plaintiff, pushed her off a bed while she was nursing one of the children; pulling her down the bed when she was heavily pregnant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>; pushed the Plaintiff on the wardrobe countertop when she put on a nice dress to meet a friend etc.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The family lived in Switzerland for the Defendant’s post-graduate studies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. When the family was in Switzerland, the landlord in Switzerland received a complaint because of the Defendant’s shouting (at the children and the Plaintiff).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     On 21 July 2019, the Defendant admitted that he had hit the Plaintiff, and reassured the Defendant that she could leave with the children, if he ever hit her again. The recording is relevant and reproduced:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Defendant: If it happens again, you can just walk with the kids.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me: No, you say...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant: You can just walk with the kids.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Woman: (0:06) You say...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Man: (0:06) I don’t like this kind of recording.

The Plaintiff’s father also filed an affidavit setting out what he had seen of the Defendant’s conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The Defendant’s parents themselves were also aware of the Defendant’s anger management issues. They spoke to him about this anger and even suggested that the Defendant sought help.

B is still very young and need a lots of parents love and nurturing. She can be playful and stubborn at times but you cannot vent your anger on her under whatever circumstances. Papa and Mama don’t raise you like that using hard approach on B. She may be scarred emotionally and have deep hatred for you when she grow up. I don’t think that is what you wanted. You told Papa before you want to give your children the best. If you really cannot control yourself, please go for help.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Plaintiff’s father spoke to the Defendant about the Defendant’s abuse over a 3-hour conversation which was recorded.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     On one occasion, the Defendant hit B near her eye. B can be heard in the recording stating that the Defendant had poured alcohol on her in his fits of anger. The extracts of the recording on 26 May 2022, taken by B are as follows and the full version is set out at paragraph 35 of P2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (0:09) B, Okay? Okay? If your mother does not even have the decency to explain that to you, she is not fit to be your mother because that is the fact. I did not aim at your eye.

Very good.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (2:04) That is the cheekbone. Okay? This is ... very near to your eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (2:09) It’s not the eye, B. Cheekbone and eye are two different things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (2:12) So the fact that Papa aimed there, it is not right.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (2:15) I did not aim at your eye, B.

Oh no!</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (6:50) Very hard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (6:56) No, I don’t want to beat you like the way Papa does. Because when Papa does that to Mama, Mama gets bruises all over.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (7:02) No, Mama hits Papa and Papa gets bruises and Mama uses vulgarities and bad words on Papa.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (7:09) Does Mama even hit Papa?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Girls (7:10) No.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (7:16) I know why she sprays water at Papa because...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff (7:19) Yeah, I spray water at Papa.

Do not aim at her face. Do not aim at her head. She was literally covering her face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (8:20) You could have talked to me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Woman (8:21) And the moment her hands went down, you hit her there.

You broke my pelvic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (11:42) What kind of behaviour you had?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (11:43) You punched me. You hit me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (11:45) You hurt my wrist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Man (11:47) Okay? You do that same thing to me as well. Okay?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(...)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">B (14:06) I still remember when we were... when we were with family. With Yeye (paternal grandfather) and Nainai (paternal grandmother). I was naughty. And then papa put alcohol in my face. I still remember that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (14:15) Yeah. That was very bad.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Me (14:16) All over your face. I’m so sorry about that, B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Defendant (14:18) B, B.

That’s not a good memory to keep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The Defendant had raised in submissions that the Plaintiff did not file an application for a Personal Protection Order (PPO). The Plaintiff was alone in Singapore with 3 young children and her immigration status was tied to the Defendant. I did not place too much weight on the submission of a lack of an application for a PPO in the circumstances of this case: the Plaintiff was a foreigner living in her husband’s country and depended on him. She would have to continue living with the Defendant after filing the PPO and that would be an unsustainable outcome.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In the case of <b><em>ABZ v AYZ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0627.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 627</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, the High Court allowed the wife’s relocation to the United States. The husband’s appeal was dismissed. The Court held that the wife’s decision to relocate was understandable as she was vulnerable, alienated and isolated in Singapore. The wife had no family members or close friends in Singapore to support her. She underwent a difficult divorce and suffered a loss of self-esteem caused by years of abuse by the husband. The wife also did not hold permanent residency in Singapore. Notwithstanding the wife’s work experience in her younger days, given the years she spent as a homemaker, the High Court held that it would be difficult for her to re-enter the workplace.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In the same vein, the Plaintiff in this case worked when she was younger but became a fulltime homemaker and the children’s primary caregiver throughout the duration of her marriage. She was isolated here without familial support and then subjected to violence not only targeted against her, but which spilled over to the children. That is of concern. The Plaintiff and the children should be given this opportunity to heal with familial support and the children be brought up in an environment without stress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Further, the Plaintiff’s immigration status in Singapore is uncertain. On 12 May 2023, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (<b>“ICA”</b>), informed the Defendant that the Plaintiff’s Permanent Resident (“PR”) status would be valid for “5 years” <em>i.e.</em>, until 12 May 2028.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     On 6 November 2023, when the Plaintiff visited ICA, she discovered that her PR status was terminated, and her Singapore identity card had to be surrendered to the ICA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The Defendant did not admit to any involvement on his part with regards the cancellation of the Plaintiff’s PR status.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Unfortunately, the loss of her PR status meant that the Plaintiff could not stay on in Singapore especially if the Defendant did not sponsor her. With divorce proceedings underway in Indonesia, it is unlikely that the Defendant would act as her sponsor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     With an uncertain immigration status, and a marriage marred by violence or abuse; no familial support (like the wife in <b><em>ABZ v AYZ), it</em></b> is understandable why the Plaintiff wanted to stay on in Jakarta with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Primary caregiver’s wishes to be considered</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Plaintiff’s wish to have the children returned to Jakarta is reasonable given the matters above and the findings I made. The Plaintiff had been abused by the Defendant and she should be in her home country with her support network. She lost her PR status in Singapore. There would not be an opportunity for her to stay in Singapore for the long term. The Plaintiff does not have any family members in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The parties’ relationship was unstable due to the Defendant’s violence and behavior, and I refer to the few descriptions of the violence and abuse suffered by the Plaintiff which unfortunately spilled over to the older child. The younger children should also not be triangulated in the conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The final straw was the incident on 29 September 2022. The Defendant had raised his hand to hit the Plaintiff, and this was witnessed by the Plaintiff’s father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> As her father, the Plaintiff’s father was protective of her and the children. With the backing of her family, the Plaintiff took the step to protect the children and herself by staying on in Jakarta.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Given the circumstances and the factual matrix of this case, I find that it is more likely than not that greater harm would be suffered by the Plaintiff and the children if the children are not allowed to relocate. It is in the best interests of these young children to relocate to Jakarta to be reunited with their mother, the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Defendant claimed that the children repeatedly expressed their wish to return to Singapore when they were in Jakarta with the Plaintiff. He submitted that Singapore was their home since birth, they had been displaced from their home and placed in an unfamiliar environment, taken away from their father and their grandparents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The Court in <b><em>WRT v WRU</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30720-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 38</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> has highlighted at [38] that although the child(ren)’s wishes are “<em>relevant, they are not determinative</em>”. Further, the age of the child(ren) is an important factor in the Court’s consideration of their wishes. The younger the child(ren), the less appropriate it was for the Court to rely on any expression of interest for or against relocation as they do not have the requisite maturity to make decisions on such major issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     At ages between 3 to 7 years old, the children would not fully understand the weight of what was said to them and by them, prompted by the Defendant and recorded by the Defendant. I agreed with the legal principle that the children’s wishes should be considered but they had to be also considered taking into account their ages and the fact that the Defendant had a strong controlling personality eg the Defendant could be heard asking leading questions in the recordings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     Given their ages, they would easily re-adapt to being home in Jakarta with their primary caregiver. I refer to <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24079-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 9</a> in which Ong J, as she then was, held the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">55    This was not a case where a child and her family have lived in Singapore for many years with strong ties to Singapore, or at least ties which are not merely transient. It is perfectly reasonable for a family desiring to live in Singapore to set up a home here, but the intentions of parties would no longer be the same after their relationship has broken down. In the present case, disallowing relocation was in effect compelling the Mother to live permanently or indefinitely in a country which was not her home, and a country where her immigration status was tenuous and uncertain. In this regard, the Father argued that the Mother’s wishes should not be taken into account as it is the child’s welfare that should be the court’s concern. However, I was of the view that to wholly disregard the life circumstances that the primary carer will be confronted with was simply out of touch with the realities of life and was also inconsistent with the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    The Father submitted that the UK would now be a “brand new environment” for C, but it appears that C had spent some time in the UK when he was younger, and to some extent, had a life planned out for him in the UK before the relationship breakdown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">57    The DJ was also not wrong to find that C was young and adaptable, and would be able to settle down in the UK with a loving parent by his side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     In fact, the children have expressed that they did not want to be away from the Plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Well-settledness and country of birth</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     As for the Defendant’s claim that the children would be returning to the country of their births, this “status quo” was displaced with the children living in Jakarta with the Defendant’s consent, from 29 September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    As set out in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life. The relevant extracts are set out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[51]  whether a child is well settled in Singapore is a relevant factor that should be given appropriate weight. It was also important, however, to bear in mind that in a globalised world, families are geographically mobile and adaptable, and the weight to be placed on well-settledness will depend on other related circumstances including how many years the child has lived in that country, the age of the child, and whether that country has been the family’s home for many years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[52]  Well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[54]  The argument of well-settledness, in protracted litigation proceedings, will tend to favour the party objecting to relocation: the longer the child is kept in Singapore, the more well settled he is likely to be in the country. In some situations, a party who prolongs proceedings may thereby seek to benefit from that contrivance by advancing the argument that the child is now well settled in Singapore and thus should not be relocated. The court should give appropriate consideration and weight to this factor of well-settledness in the context of other relevant factors and overall setting of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I could not agree to a submission of the children having a routine or being well-settled from 31 October 2023. Their abduction from Jakarta on 31 October 2023 was an act engineered by the Defendant. He had abducted the children on 31 October 2023 but took some 4-5 months to file his affidavit in reply and/or his cross application. He should not benefit from this delaying tactic to secure a litigation advantage at the expense of the children’s welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    As for Singapore being the children’s home country, I had tied the children’s home to being with their primary caregiver, their mother. The Plaintiff had tried to maintain the marriage but the Defendant’s conduct caused the breakdown of the marriage. The children should not be deprived of their relationship with their primary caregiver especially given the facts of this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I had made a finding that the Defendant was/is not the children primary caregiver and his anger management issues would be detrimental to the children in the long run. He has also shown that he had no qualms in bad-mouthing the Plaintiff to the children and he had embarked on a campaign since their return to stop her contact with them. This was not acceptable given their young ages and that she was/is their primary caregiver. As such, as set out in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a>, there must be appropriate consideration and weight to the factor of well-settledness or return to home county in the context of other relevant factors and overall setting of the case. The relevant factors here do not support a contention that the children should remain in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Loss of parental relationship and claims of alienation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Parties both claimed that the other would alienate or have alienated the children from him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    On the Plaintiff’s part, I am satisfied that she would not alienate the children from the Defendant and there would not be a loss in their relationship. She had involved the Defendant in the children’s lives in Jakarta from September 2022 and the fact that he had spent so much time with them when they were there speaks for itself. His contact with the children was not controlled or fettered in anyway. The Plaintiff has also come up with a generous access plan and this was endorsed on 12 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    On the other hand, when the Defendant’s abducted the children from Jakarta to Singapore, he had been uncooperative regarding the information between the Plaintiff and the children. He had imposed conditions and he had controlled the video/telephone calls. Given the way he had even rejected proposals for the Plaintiff to see the children in supervised setting by the government agencies, I am not confident that he would ensure contact between the Plaintiff and the children if the children remained in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Whilst loss of relationship is an important consideration, it is inevitable as a consequence of family breakdown. The Plaintiff has shown that she supported contact between the Defendant and the children in the 13 months they lived in Jakarta. The Defendant has also shown that he has the financial means and flexibility to travel to Jakarta and/or to relocate there as well. The uniqueness in this case is that one did not need to conjecture about a relocation plan and access because past actions and conduct showed that the Plaintiff supported the Defendant’s access with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    Given the facts of this case and the matters I have set out, I therefore granted the Plaintiff’s application and allowed the relocation. I also endorsed the access plans presented by the Plaintiff as they are fair and reasonable; her past conduct during the 13 months showed that she would fulfil her end of the bargain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    I also awarded costs to the Plaintiff fixed at $8,000 and disbursements as drawn.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p

The husband is 53 years of age and a Managing Director of a global logistics company. He is a German citizen. The wife is 46 years old and a Singaporean. There was dispute as to her employment status. While she worked in various capacities prior to her marriage, it was her position that she was asked by her husband to be a homemaker upon marriage. She claimed to have only taken on various ad hoc or part-time work over short periods of time. She claimed therefore that she was not earning a regular nor consistent amount of income. The husband pointed to various work engagements that she had taken on especially as a real estate agent. He was of the view that she was earning more than she was willing to declare and that she had the capacity to work as she holds a degree in business administration and had experience and skills to support the family if she wanted to. One of the key concerns in this case was the wife’s challenges with mental health and its impact on her ability to work and parent effectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The couple have 3 children. The eldest child is a child of the wife from a previous relationship. The husband embraced the child as a child of the family on marrying the plaintiff in 2006. The child was formally adopted in September 2006. He is currently a polytechnic student. There are 2 biological children from the marriage, a son who is 17 years of age and pursuing post-secondary education at the Institute of Technical Education and a daughter who is 9 and in primary 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties resided in a 5-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat (matrimonial flat) until 2014 when they rented a terrace house for more space to accommodate the growing needs of the family. The husband claimed that the wife wanted a rather more luxurious life and that this move was initiated largely on that account. The matrimonial flat was rented out for between $3,000 - $4,000 every month. The wife received the rental income which she would then transfer into a joint account held by the couple after keeping a sum of $500 for her allowance. The money was then used to pay for the rent of the terrace house they moved into. Given that the rent for the house was between $5,000 and $5,500 monthly, the additional amount was paid for by the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It was the husband’s position that the monies in the joint account was being used by the wife for unnecessary expenses and without proper accounting. He chose to stop depositing his salary into their joint account and the wife responded by keeping the rental income in her sole account from January 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial assets and the appropriate approach to its division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The power of a court to divide matrimonial assets when or subsequent to a grant of judgment of divorce is found in s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (1961). The division, taking into account the non-exhaustive factors found in s 112(2) of the Charter, is to be in proportions which a court deems just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       A matrimonial asset is defined in s 112(10) to mean any asset acquired <em>before the marriage</em> by one party or both parties to the marriage either ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more their children while the parties are residing together for certain purposes, <em>or</em> which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage. A matrimonial asset also refers to any asset of any nature acquired <em>during the marriage</em> by one or both parties. The section also addresses the nature of gifts acquired by one or both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Other than the estimated values of the matrimonial flat and the Malaysian property and different positions on the ownership of a family car, the parties were largely in agreement on the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For the matrimonial flat the husband provided an estimate of $750,000 based on listings on a website known as <em>property guru</em> a month after the IJ was granted. The wife provided an initial estimate of $840,000 based on information that existed prior to the grant of IJ but in her subsequent affidavit she provided an estimate of between $790,000 - $840,000, taken from the HDB <em>InfoWeb</em> resale flat prices enquiry.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> I took the average of the highest estimates provided by the parties for the matrimonial flat given that the sources relied on were reliable. The estimate provided by the husband for the Malaysian property however was in my view a more accurate estimate as the wife seemed to rely on rather casual conversations with a real estate agent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. She also did not know of the outstanding loan for this property as her husband financed the same as he did the matrimonial flat, the latter from his CPF funds. The Malaysian property had a negative equity value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Although the wife referred to a BMW family car as a joint asset, this was registered under the husband’s name and paid for by him though driven principally by the wife. Separately, the husband was provided with a vehicle by the company he worked for. The BMW driven by the wife was sold and proceeds should appropriately be reflected as part of the husband’s assets and not a jointly held asset. The wife had lost her driving licence in 2022 arising from road traffic related offences including a drink driving conviction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I removed from the pool of assets, 2 bank accounts the wife held jointly with her eldest son and with her daughter, respectively. The first was a POSB Kids account with a relatively modest sum of $28.05. This account was used to meet the son’s expenses. The second is a Child Development Account (CDA) she held with her daughter, and which contained $19,511.81. This account can only be used for fixed purposes largely related to the daughter’s education and any unused amount will be transferred to the daughter’s post-secondary education account on her turning 12 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Parties in their submissions confirmed that the various insurance policies would not be part of the pool of assets. These policies do not offer any value if surrendered, were paid for by the husband solely and continued coverage would benefit the named beneficiaries. Three policies were for the eldest child, four policies were taken out for the second child and three for the youngest child. There were payments made by the husband for fire insurance, family travel and cord blood storage facilities. The husband had six policies while the wife had two health policies amounting to about $3,426 a year ($285.50 a month) and a critical illness plan which had a monthly premium of $92.20. As these payments were made from the couple’s joint account, this was taken into consideration when the division of matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance were considered and determined.<span

The counsel for the wife argued that this case involved a long marriage where the wife was largely a homemaker although she may have taken part-time assignments. He argued for the application of the approach in <b><em>TNL</em></b> v <b><em>TNK and another appeal</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20026-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 15</a> where mutual respect for spousal contributions in both economic and homemaking spheres was urged and the court was in “general agreement” towards an equal division in long single-income marriages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> While the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL</em> defined single income marriages as marriages where one spouse is the sole income earner and the other plays the role of homemaker, counsel highlighted various authorities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that adopt this definition to effectively mean marriages where one spouse takes on the primary responsibility for the financial needs of the family while the other takes on the primary role of homemaker. I agreed with counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In this case, when the husband pointed out that his wife had been employed in the past and was significantly involved in real estate work as an agent on an ad hoc/part-time capacity, she confirmed that she did indeed work but never had any consistent pattern of work or income. Her bank balances showed large enough amounts to certainly question her position but the evidence pointing to any regular income was not scant. It appeared that she was well provided for by her husband and/or was able to obtain good income from certain assignments, likely in the real estate arena.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the evidence, the dichotomy between the primary breadwinner and primary homemaker was evident during this marriage, regardless of the positions that each took on the reasons why the wife stayed at home. It is well in keeping with the spirit of <em>TNL</em> and I approached the task of division with the principles of <em>TNL</em> in mind. Having said that however, the facts presented in this case required a more cautious approach. Being at home does not make one a homemaker. The latter requires active and often, constant engagement with the numerous aspects of family life ranging from household chores to the management of children, their needs and their schedules. Additionally, often in relatively long marriages, the nature of engagement at home may change either because children may not require the same level of support throughout the time of the marriage or circumstances such as poor health prevent full participation, as was seen in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of the matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The wife who appeals against my orders had in her affidavit sought a transfer of the husband’s share, interest and title in the matrimonial flat free from encumbrances and without any refund of his CPF monies. She additionally sought that the Malaysian property and all other assets be divided equitably.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In her skeletal submissions however, her counsel sought on the basis of <em>TNL</em> and various cases where the marriage was “moderately long” of between 15-18 years, a division of 35-40% of the matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It went on to additionally seek the transfer of the matrimonial flat to the wife, free from encumbrances and without refund of the husband’s CPF monies. I found these requests to be at odds. If the interests of the husband in the matrimonial flat were transferred to the wife free from encumbrances and without any refund of his CPF monies, she essentially would be getting a lot more than the 35-40% of the matrimonial assets. A 40% share of the net value of <em>all</em> the matrimonial assets based on the tables above, would be $498,098.91. An entitlement to the HDB flat by way of a transfer without having to pay any consideration, however, provides her with $643,730.75 which is more than 50% of the net value of matrimonial assets. This is not in keeping even with the approach in <em>TNL</em> which leans toward an equal division in long marriages. Regardless, I agreed with the approach submitted by the wife’s counsel but gave it effect as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A 25% share of the net value of the matrimonial flat which in real terms would be approximately <b>$160, 682.69</b> (based on 25 % of $642, 730.75 which is the net value after deducting the outstanding loan of $152,269.25 from the estimate sale price of $795,000);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Her ability to retain her significant pool of solely held assets totalling <b>$376, 511.17</b>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Half of the amounts in 2 joint accounts with her husband (DBS and Maybank) totalling a modest <b>$262.60</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The orders above give the wife a total of <b>$537,456.46</b> which is effectively <b>43.16%</b> of the net value of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While the husband in this case cannot be said to have insisted that the wife stay home, it appears that the healthy income the husband was drawing and the move from Shanghai to Singapore with the eldest child allowed and/or necessitated the wife to continue to be present for the family on arriving in Singapore. The birth of their second and third children in 2007 and 2015 respectively would have meant a high degree of involvement with their care during infancy and young childhood, even with the assistance of helpers. I also did not doubt that she was present for them in routine matters like parent-teacher meetings and involved herself in their school and enrichment activities especially, in the early part of her sons’ childhood. Her acumen in handling renovation works, managing the helpers, sourcing and managing the tenants at the matrimonial flat should be given due credit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Her work as a real estate agent at least till 2018 shows a certain strength and perseverance and would have assisted in some of the expenses of the family. Her continued desire to improve her skills is also evident when she obtained certification as a fitness instructor in 2020 and certification in digital marketing in 2021. At the same time, I did not think that her engagement at home was as involved as she made it out to be through the entire course of the marriage. This can be attributable to her mental health concerns. Additionally, a significant part of what she said were her indirect contributions related to the fact of pregnancy and having delivered her daughter in 2015 after what must have been a very traumatic period when her third pregnancy ended in a still birth in 2014. It is in my view rather dangerous to look at having children in and of itself as a contribution which should in some way be considered and even compensated. The trials and trauma often associated with childbearing and a challenging delivery process are certainly not to be minimised but in the context of assessing relevant contributions, I was mindful not to give it undue weight. Parenting is the focus rather more than having children. Notwithstanding, I was of the view that the contributions of the wife in the larger context of a marriage that lasted a little more than 17 years made a ballpark share of 40% of the assets, a fair one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Moving beyond a 40 % share is not unusual if there are factors which warrant an uplift.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> What stood out in the case before me and is of considerable concern is the mental health challenges faced by the wife which appear to have impeded her ability to contribute to her maximum capacity, even if she had wanted to. She spoke of how she has Thalassaemia, Adjustment Disorder for which she first sought treatment in 2011, post-natal depression in 2014, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in 2020 and for which she still seeks treatment, alcohol dependency for which she is receiving help to overcome and cervical spondylosis diagnosed in 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> While clearly the physical ailments are not of a nature that would disable her from being active and productive, the MDD and alcohol dependency are of concern. The path to recovery takes time and a lot of effort. Any dramatic changes such as divorce and what it means from a financial and emotional standpoint needs to be appreciated. It is of course not the task of a court to attempt to assist this path of recovery by overstating what she should receive by way a division of assets. However, the pool of assets had to be distributed in a way that recognised the need for her to find accommodation of her own after more than 17 years of being largely supported by her husband who was well placed in his employment and could provide substantially for the family. She cannot be expected to simply overcome her mental health challenges and even with the best of efforts, it does take time and resolve. At the same time, I did not see it fair to place an unnecessary burden on the husband by imposing a responsibility to provide monthly maintenance for the long term or a lump sum amount to cater for her circumstances especially given my orders on the care and control of the children which I shall elaborate on further. I chose instead to afford a more generous division of the assets to allow a fair recognition of the past and adequate provision for the wife’s future. Section 112 (2) (h) of the Charter allows factors under s 114 to be taken into account insofar as those factors are relevant. The wife’s financial needs for the foreseeable future given her mental health challenges and the standard of living she was used to are factors that I felt necessary to bring into play.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Care and Control of the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Parties agreed to have joint custody of the children but contested care and control of them. I accepted that the father was better placed to care for the children at this time and was of the view that any effort to place them in the care of their mother would compromise their interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It was the father’s position that the children were traumatised by their mother who was often violent when under the influence alcohol.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> He also claimed that she spent most of her time in her bedroom and the chores were done by the domestic helpers while he attended to most of the needs of the children. The wife’s version was diametrically opposed. One of the key concerns was also the care of the third child. As a young daughter, the mother felt that she would benefit from being in her care more so than the boys who were closing in on adulthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even as mental health concerns do not necessarily hinder parents from parenting effectively, much depends on the nature and degree of difficulty. The impact on children may also vary. I spoke with the children together with a psychologist from the counselling and psychological services (CAPs) unit of the family justice courts to understand better what they felt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The psychologist had a few minutes with the children before I spoke with them to ensure they were comfortable meeting with me.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> My meeting with them was both helpful and sealed my view and the need to have the father care for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is without doubt that these children are loved by their parents. It is equally without doubt that the children love their parents. However, the mother’s current lack of ability to effectively parent the children due to her struggles with depression and excessive alcohol consumption requires a better plan of care at least for the immediate future. I accepted the position of the father that the mother spends much time in isolation and most of the caregiving is done by him and the helper(s). I do not have any reason to doubt the children who shared this too.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The boys are at an age (20 and 17, respectively) where the same level of involvement they would have required when they were younger is no longer needed. Much time is spent in school and with friends. National service is also around the corner for both boys. The eldest will be enlisted after he finishes with his polytechnic education by which time he would be closing in on 21 years of age. Depending on the educational path of the second son, national service is also in the near horizon. The daughter is at an age however, which may require the physical and emotional presence of her mother. Her mother however is not able to meet the needs of her young daughter fully and effectively. I am of the view that placing her in an environment where she would need to continuously witness her mother’s emotional turbulence would compromise her growth and general welfare. I was not confident having heard from all the children, that their mother is in a space currently to put her children first. She would need to stay on course towards recovery before this can happen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The mother presented a letter from her treating doctor at SGH dated 30 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The doctor shared that the mother was on 5 medications which included an antidepressant, a major tranquiliser, 2 sleeping tables and an antihistamine. He believed that with treatment, her depressive symptoms have come under control but that “<em>her prognosis is less than favourable considering her ongoing use of alcohol</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He was of the view that she did not pose any physical harm to the children and there was no evidence to suggest she was not a good parent. Even then, the doctor shared concerns about her use of alcohol for which she attends Alcoholic Anonymous and obtains guidance and treatment from the National Additions Management Services (NAMS). I did not disagree with the position that she poses no physical threat to the children even though her husband stated that there were times when she was violent. What I was deeply concerned about was the emotional toil that she may be exerting on the children and her lack of ability to provide the sense of stability and peace that her children deserve. Additionally, the 3 children would need to be together under the same roof as the boys offer much help and support to their young sister. It was clear during my conversation with each child separately that they want very much to be together and in the home of their father. Separating them would place considerable stress and emotional harm on them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I was confident of the care the father was providing the children and which the children themselves articulated with ease and honesty. It is hoped that the good care that the father has been providing will enable the children to grow well and embrace various opportunities ahead of them. I see these children as having immense potential if they are free from the worry they all shared about their mother’s wellbeing. It is almost poignant that they expressed a desire to see her because they did not want her to do poorly without them around. Yet it is their mother who is seeking to care for them. The palpable irony of these articulated emotions speak of children wanting to parent the parent. But they are the children. They cannot be the adults. They need the opportunity to achieve their dreams through education, work, and healthy relationships. The orders are meant to give them the conditions to enable this. The orders are not meant to remove their mother from their lives but to allow for a safe space to have the relationship develop in positive ways. I am sure the children want to be with the mother they knew when they were younger and not the person their mother becomes under the volatile combination of alcohol and medication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Despite the brief interaction with the children, I was deeply impressed by them. They were open and mature. They loved their parents in equal measure. They understood that their mother was struggling. The challenges the family has faced has most certainly impacted them but with proper guidance, they have the capacity to move beyond the struggles. I encourage the father to explore ways such as counselling during which time the children can address their emotions openly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Maintenance of children is a joint responsibility placed on parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>The husband did not seek any financial support from the wife should he retain care and control of the children. The wife did not offer any. I made no orders for the wife to provide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the ex-wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     There was an interim maintenance order in place which provided for an amount of $15,315 per month to the wife that included payment for the terrace house they were renting, various household bills and the children’s expenses. The maintenance needed to be re-assessed in the context of changed circumstances especially with regards separate accommodation moving forward and the fact that the children’s expenses were to be handled by the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Section 114 of the Charter provides for a court to order reasonable maintenance for ex-wives with a set of guiding factors for that determination. In her affidavit of assets and means, the wife sought $15,000 per month as maintenance for herself which would be almost 70% of the net monthly income of the husband which stood at approximately $21,507 monthly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The personal expenses of the wife amounting to $6,920 monthly were itemised and kept distinct from household and children’s expenses which stood at $14,048.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Clearly many of the household and children’s expenses such as monthly rent at $5,500 and children’s food and school expenses are no longer relevant. Even if one were to look at personal expenses, many items related to grooming, gym facilities and travel and are not items that could be said to be reasonable for the husband to bear indefinitely. The wife requested in the alternative, a lump sum of maintenance. I did not think this appropriate given the position I took on the care of the children and the need to preserve resources for their immediate needs including accommodation. In fact, the husband had far less in his bank accounts than his wife. I ordered that the wife be provided $2,000 per month instead for a period of 2 years only. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The husband has the sole responsibility of meeting the children’s needs which would likely involve tertiary education expenses for the boys in the foreseeable future. He is 53 years of age and would need to find a clear and consistent balance between meeting his retirement needs, supporting his children and ensuring a roof over their heads given that the matrimonial flat would be sold. There is no extended family support. The wife has her mother and sister in Singapore. In seeking care and control she had also proposed that they live temporarily with her in her mother’s house and spoke of her ability to provide care despite her medical conditions. Yet in her request for maintenance, she spoke of the need to find her own accommodation as her relationship with her mother had its own challenges, be supported on account of her health conditions, and her inability to keep a job that would cater for her expenses. Despite her mental health challenges, she has been able to find work. She can choose to do so and is in a position to focus on work and build on her resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the challenges posed by MDD and excessive alcohol consumption cannot be denied, it would be wrong to enable a lack of resolve in taking focussed and consistent steps towards recovery, by continued reliance on the husband’s provision for the long term. Maintenance cannot be used to support a lifestyle of heavy drinking. She has capacity, experience, educational qualifications and good contacts to take fresh steps to work and support herself. Counsel’s submission that s 114(1)(e) which makes physical and mental disability a relevant consideration in the assessment of maintenance appears to suggest that the mental health concerns of the wife ought to be considered as forms of mental disability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I did not agree. A large part of the current challenge as indicated by her treating doctor is the consumption of alcohol while being treated for MDD. This has not prevented her from functioning well in a work setting and she strongly defended her ability to care for her children. She is not incapacitated. What she does need is continued assistance and time to work through her challenges. She has to take steps to support herself and the lifestyle she wishes to lead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The provision of $2,000 per month for a period of 2 years is to assist her with reasonable expenses over a reasonable period including keeping up with insurance premiums which were previously paid by the husband, while she regains her strength and independence. Free from the need to support her children, she would be able to do so if she exercises that choice. She has sufficient resources as well to carry her through the next few years even if she chooses not to work on a full-time basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The mental health challenges the wife faces has impacted the family adversely. At the same time, the relative strength of the husband and children and their support and love for the wife/mother, speak of a good future. The order on care and control sought to provide opportunity for the children to grow in a healthy environment while maintaining links with their mother. The orders on the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance while largely based on the factors provided by the Charter, sought to provide to each party a reasonable ability to move in a positive direction to build new lives while they continue with their most important role – as parents.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Correspondence dated 11 June 2024 – both counsel were to submit on costs within one week of the orders, if costs were not agreed to.

The Wife is legally aided. She is represented by Ms Pang Peck Ki (“Ms Pang”) who has been assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband, on the other hand, is represented by Ms Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

Ms Pang submitted that costs be fixed at $2500 (all-in) to be paid by the Husband to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for the Husband, he was content to leave the quantum of costs to be decided by the court, though he highlighted that the Wife was not successful in all aspects of the matter in that she did not obtain orders in respect of every item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Given that the Wife was successful in that she had obtained orders in respect of the majority of the items in her application for discovery and interrogatories, she is entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       However, because the Wife is legally-aided, the provisions of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAAA”), which traces its roots to the New South Wales Legal Assistance Act (1943 – 1947),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> are also relevant to consider. For ease of reference, the relevant provisions are reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Costs</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.—(1)    Where an aided person is entitled to costs in any proceedings to which the aided person is a party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the court must make, in favour of the aided person, such order for costs as the court would have made in favour of a person who is not an aided person; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    where costs follow the event, the aided person is entitled to the same costs as a person who is not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Subsection (1) does not apply to any costs against another aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Where any moneys are recovered by an aided person (whether in proceedings or by virtue of a settlement or compromise), the aided person is liable to pay to the Director so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    For the purposes of subsection (3), the moneys recovered in respect of costs are deemed to be so much of the total amount so recovered as exceeds the amount (if any) recoverable by the aided person otherwise than as costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Without limiting subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4), “costs” includes —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    counsel’s fees, whether or not the same have been paid;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), are expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or are advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs recovered by the Director under this section include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5)(b) and (c), such costs must be applied, in the first instance, in and towards satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In short, when it comes to the quantum of costs, what s 16(1) of the LAAA provides is that a legally-aided person is to be treated no differently from a litigant who is not legally-aided in the proceedings when it comes to an assessment of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the circumstances, I fix costs at $1650 (all-in). In doing so, I take into account the fact that SUM 1426 was not legally complex as it involved no novel legal arguments. SUM 1426 was also not factually complex given that there were only 4 main items in the Wife’s request for discovery and one main item in the Wife’s request for interrogatories. The written submissions and bundle of authorities filed were also not particularly lengthy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The second question which I must turn my mind to, given that the Wife is legally-aided, is who should the Husband be ordered to pay costs to. As a starting point, it is trite that only a party to the proceeding is entitled to costs. That much is clear from the words of Rule 852(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>When costs to follow the event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">852.—(1)    Subject to the following provisions of this Division, <b>a party is not entitled to recover any costs of or incidental to any proceedings from any other party to the proceedings except under an order of the Court.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Rule 9 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 also provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Construction of references to party, etc., in person</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9.—(1)    In these Rules, for the purposes of any relevant matter or proceeding, unless the context otherwise requires —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    a reference to a person, plaintiff or party who sues or acts in person, to a defendant or party who appears, defends or acts in person, to an appellant or a respondent who appears, who does not or fails to appear or who acts in person, or to a litigant in person includes a reference to…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Two interlinked points may be drawn from the above. First, that the Director of Legal Aid is not, and cannot, be considered a party to the proceedings. Second, and following from this, it cannot be ordered that costs be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. The only exception where money may be directly paid to the Director of Legal Aid is concerning moneys paid into court. This is provided for by Rule 444 of the FJR 2014 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Person to whom payment to be made</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">444.—(1)    Where the party entitled to money in Court is a person in respect of whom a Grant of Aid is or has been in force entitling him to legal aid under the Legal Aid and Advice Act (Cap. 160), payment must be made —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to that party’s solicitor; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if that party is not represented by a solicitor, to the Director of Legal Aid if the Court so orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The payment in paragraph (1) may be made without the need for any authority from the party referred to in that paragraph.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Subject to paragraph (1), payment must be made —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to the party entitled;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    on the party’s written authority, to his solicitor; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    if the Court so orders, to the party’s solicitor without such authority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    This rule applies whether the money in Court has been paid into Court under rule 435 or under the order of the Court or a certificate of the Registrar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The conclusion which I have reached is supported by the wording of s 16 of the LAAA. For example, s 16(3) of the LAAA (see above at [6]) states that Wife is accordingly liable to pay, out of the moneys recovered in the course of the proceedings, “so much of the moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs” to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Also relevant is the Legal Aid and Advice Regulations (“LAAR”). Regulation 14 provides what is to be done with moneys payable to aided persons. In particular, Regulation 14(4) states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where in any proceedings to which an aided person is a party —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    an order or agreement is made providing for the recovery or preservation of property for the benefit of the aided person and, by virtue of section 22A of the Act, there is a first charge on the property for the benefit of the Fund; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>an order or agreement is made for the payment of costs to the aided person</b>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">the Director may —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    require the aided person to take such proceedings, being proceedings which may be taken under section 5 of the Act, as may be necessary to enforce or give effect to the order or agreement; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)    <b>proceed to enforce any such order or agreement for the payment of money by the issue in his name of such proceedings referred to in sub-paragraph (i) as the Director deems fit in any court, without reference to the aided person, if the aided person fails, refuses or is unable to take</b> those proceedings or the Director is of the opinion that it is reasonable and expedient to do so having regard to the probable cost of proceedings and the likelihood of their being successful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This is the effect of s 16 of the LAAA read with Regulation 14 of the LAAR. Costs should be paid to the legally aided person who is then liable to pay this sum to the Director of Legal Aid. This follows from the proposition that the Director of Legal Aid, who is not a party to the proceedings, is not entitled to costs. In the event that the person who is liable to pay costs does not do so, the Director of Legal Aid may step in and directly enforce the order to pay costs to the legally aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     One might raise the point that there is effectively, no difference between an order to pay costs directly to the Director of Legal Aid, as opposed to an order to pay costs to a party in the proceedings. After all, that sum will, in any case, have to be paid to the Director of Legal Aid. While this is true, it is important to specify <b><em>who</em></b> costs should be paid to – the non-legally aided party could well raise the argument that the order was defective on the ground that a non-party to the proceedings is not entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore order that the Husband pay costs of SUM 1426, fixed at $1650 (all-in) to the Wife. This is to be done by 16 October 2024. I also further order that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum from the Husband, make payment to the Director of Legal Aid as is required under s 16 of the LAAA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Pang and Ms Seetha for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Grant of Aid issued on 27 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (6 June 1956) vol 1 at col 1960 where the Minister for Labour and Welfare, Mr Lim Yew Hock said: “It will therefore be seen that the present system of legal assistance to poor persons is altogether too limited to do more than touch the fringe of the need. The need for an improved legal aid service is long overdue and the Marshall Government can take justifiable pride in introducing this much needed social legislation. The Bill now under consideration indicates the lines along which we might well proceed. There may perhaps be need for modifications or amendments as a result of experience gained over a period, but as to the general proposition that the time is long overdue for a comprehensive legal aid service, there can be little disagreement. Much work and thought has gone into the drafting of the Bill. An officer of the Colonial Legal Service spent several weeks in the Public Solicitor's Office in Sydney, New South Wales, studying the legislation, practice and procedure there, and, in the main, this Bill, based on his recommendations, is an adaptation to local conditions of the New South Wales Legal Assistance Act, 1943-1947”.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-09-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)","title":"XBG v XBH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 81","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32214-SSP.xml","counsel":["Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff","The defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-10-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBG v XBH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBG <em>v</em> XBH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32214-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 81</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">09 September 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff; The defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBG — XBH </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">9 September 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SUM 1204/2024 (“SUM 1204”) was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories.

Given that the Husband had succeeded in obtaining orders in respect of the majority of the items in his application for discovery and interrogatories, he should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There are no reasons to depart from this starting point. Insofar as the Wife appears to take the position that the Husband had delayed proceedings by filing his application for discovery and interrogatories, that is not a tenable argument in the present circumstances. The Family Justice Rules 2014 provide a framework by which discovery and interrogatories should be exchanged between parties on a voluntary basis. If a party is not satisfied with the extent of disclosure and the responses to interrogatories, they are entitled to apply to court. That was what the Husband had done in the present case and there is no suggestion that he had done so to delay proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In any event, a look at the procedural history of SUM 1204 reveals that the Wife must also bear some responsibility in the delay of the hearing of this summons. At the case conference on 28 March 2024, directions were given to the Wife to file her affidavit in reply to SUM 1204 by 3 May 2024. At the subsequent case conference on 9 May 2024, Mr Teo had told the court that the Wife had not filed her reply affidavit. He explained that he was unable to take instructions from the Wife. Apparently, she was travelling and would only return at the end of June.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Mr Teo had also told the court that the Wife had left sometime around the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 2024. As the court had observed at that case conference, it would have been abundantly clear to the Wife that directions had been given to her to file her reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the next case conference on 27 June 2024, the court fixed SUM 1204 for hearing before me in August. The reason for this was because the Husband had applied for legal aid,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and he had informed the court that he was waiting to be assigned a lawyer from the Legal Aid Bureau.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I do not take into account any delays occasioned by the Husband’s application for legal aid in my assessment of costs for SUM 1204. Parties are entitled to apply for legal aid. In such cases, some time may be budgeted for the Legal Aid Bureau to assess the application for legal aid, and for any assigned lawyers to come on board (see s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (2020 Rev Ed); <em>WXQ v WXR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31583-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 35</a>). That was what had been done in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     What is relevant, in my view, is the Wife’s conduct. As I have already noted (above at [6] – [7]), she did not comply with the court’s deadlines to file her reply affidavit to SUM 1204. In addition to this, as I had noted in my grounds of decision on the substantive merits of SUM 1204, the Wife had not only provided insufficient answers to the interrogatories, some of her responses were also provocative, sarcastic and insulting. I reproduce a few examples of what the Wife had said (see <em>XBG v XBH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 65</a> at [41] and [46]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a husband, the Defendant should know better. The Defendant would be a complete failure if he is not aware of what the Plaintiff is working as.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>A. Please state the nature of the Business venture in Vietnam:</b> The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam and the Plaintiff would like to claim losses as a result of being his wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Taking this into account, I fix costs of SUM 1204 at $1100 (all in) which shall be paid by the Wife to the Husband by 30 September 2024. This award of costs not only reflects the Husband’s success in his application, but is also meant to signal that the taking of such adversarial and provocative stances are simply “not acceptable in [our] family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice”: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29578-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dated 28 August 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at paras 7 and 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Certificate under s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act was filed on 16 May 2024 to certify that the Husband had indeed applied for legal aid.

There are two children of the marriage. The Wife is a dance teacher, and the Husband is a Director who also works part-time as a Grab driver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife filed for divorce on 29 July 2022. The matter proceeded on the contested track as parties did not agree on the basis of the divorce. At the hearing of the contested divorce on 11 October 2023, the District Judge who heard the matter dissolved the marriage on the basis that both parties had behaved in such a way that they could not be reasonably expected to live with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The interim judgment was subsequently extracted on 12 October 2023 and parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. In the months that followed, parties took out various applications for discovery and interrogatories.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The two applications for discovery and interrogatories before me are the latest development in the procedural history of this case. SUM 1809/2024 (“SUM 1809”) was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. At the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Mr Oliver Quek (“Mr Quek”) confirmed that the Husband was no longer pursuing SUM 1809, but that his client was still pursuing the issue of costs for that summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I therefore proceeded to hear SUM 2066/2024 (“SUM 2066”) which was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There were seven main items in the Wife’s request for discovery and interrogatories. The Wife wanted the Husband to explain certain deposits and withdrawals that had been made from his bank accounts. Apart from this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to produce documents to support his explanation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to why orders should be made in respect of all the seven items, the Wife gave the same reason: that disclosure was “necessary to determine the [Husband’s] income, assets and expenses”. During the hearing, counsel for the Wife, Ms Pearlyn Yeo (“Ms Yeo”) also clarified that the documents and interrogatories sought were also relevant to the issue of whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is trite that discovery and interrogatories will only be ordered where they are relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. In addition, where interrogatories are concerned, the court is only concerned as to the <b><em>sufficiency</em></b> and not the <b><em>truth</em></b> of the answers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Apart from these well-established principles, in making orders for discovery and interrogatories, one must also bear in mind the applicable principles of law at the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is hornbook law that the court applies a broad-brush approach to the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance: <em>BCB v BCC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0324.xml')\">[2013] 2 SLR 324</a> at [10]; <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> at [23] – [24]; <em>USA v USB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> at [43]; <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10] and [29] – [30]; <em>DBA v DBB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31398-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 12</a> at [40]. The broad-brush approach is used as it “discourages parties from being overly focused on petty details and arguing over every cent”: Justice Teh Hwee Hwee, “From Confrontation to Collaboration: A Decade in Transforming the Family Justice Paradigm” (Keynote Address and CJ Koh Lecture 2024 delivered at the Family Conference 2024 on 3 September 2024) at [29].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Therefore, in applying the twin principles of relevance and necessity, it is also apposite to bear in mind the goal of reducing acrimony between the parties and discouraging them from fighting over every single cent. There is little point in the court hearing the ancillary matters adopting an approach aimed at minimising acrimony when parties have been armed and equipped, at the interlocutory stage, to fight tooth and nail over every last cent. The process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as a tool in a forensic accounting exercise in a bid to make the other spouse account for every dollar which had been spent: see <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife’s application in SUM 2066, however, could rightly be characterised as such an exercise in forensic accounting. She wanted the Husband to explain, and provide documents in support of his explanation, in respect of more than a hundred transactions from his bank accounts and Wechat account. Having looked at the sums involved in these transactions, I did not think it necessary for the Husband to have to answer every single one of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That said, I note that the Husband had indeed provided answers to the majority of the interrogatories which the Wife had posed. He provided an explanation for each transaction and given details of the same. There are some transactions, however, which the Husband had declined to provide an explanation on the basis that the court had not granted the Wife leave to ask for these items in either discovery or interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the circumstances, I deem it fit to order that the Husband answer those interrogatories posed by the Wife relating to individual transactions involving:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Sums equal to, or more than $5000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Withdrawals that add up to a sum equal to or more than $5000 over a period of three days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition to answering the interrogatories set out above (at [12]), the Husband shall also disclose any relevant documents in support of his answers to the interrogatories. If he is unable to provide such documents, he should state his explanation on affidavit and provide any relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In addition to the above, it is also ordered that the Husband file his compliance affidavit by 14 October 2024. Costs submissions for both SUM 1809 and 2066 are to be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of 3 pages. This shall be done no later than 20 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Quek and Ms Yeo for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>SUM 490/2024 was the Wife’s application for discovery.

Almost five years later, the couple welcomed their son into their family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband holds Chinese citizenship. He works as a portfolio manager. The Wife, on the other hand, is a Singapore citizen. She works as a teacher.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars provides sparse details as to why the relationship between the parties had broken down. What it does say is that the Husband did not feel love or care from the Wife who would “lash out at him in anger if he does not meet her expectations in his thoughts, speech and action”. This made him feel “lonely in the marriage” and “sometimes anxious” in her presence. Compounding matters were their disagreements on the care of their child and finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       This led to the Husband filing for divorce on 29 March 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 28 July 2023. Parties embarked on the road to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is against this backdrop that the Wife has taken out her application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1769/2024 (“SUM 1769”) against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I heard the matter on 27 August 2024. Both parties were self-represented at that hearing. I reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is trite law that discovery is only ordered where the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25]; <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a> citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband had raised one preliminary objection to the Wife’s application in SUM 1769. He pointed out that the Wife had not given him the opportunity to provide voluntary disclosure as she had not served on him the relevant requests that she was now pursuing in SUM 1769.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On that basis alone, the Husband argued, at the hearing before me, that the Wife’s entire application should be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Indeed, Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 provides that a party seeking discovery must indeed serve their written requests on the respondent:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Before an application under paragraph (1) may be filed, the applicant must serve a written request on the respondent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    seeking discovery of the said document or class of documents, in the relevant Form; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    setting out in respect of each of such document or class</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 63(7) stipulates the conditions that must be met before an application for discovery may be made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    No application under paragraph (1) may be made unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the time specified in paragraph (5) to serve the notice has elapsed, and the respondent has not served such notice;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the time specified in paragraph (6) to provide or make available the document or class of documents that the respondent has notified he is willing to provide discovery of has elapsed, and he has not provided or made available such document or class of documents; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the respondent has notified that he is not willing or not able to provide discovery of the document or class of documents specified in the written request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It appeared to me that some of the requests which the Wife was pursuing in SUM 1769 had indeed been previously sought in her 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery and Interrogatories (“RFDI”) dated 19 March 2024 and 2 May 2024 respectively. However, the manner in which the Wife had framed her requests in SUM 1769 made it difficult to assess whether she was still pursuing discovery in respect of the items previously sought in her previous requests or if she had broadened the scope of discovery that she was asking for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On this basis, I do not think it could be definitively said that the Wife’s entire application was indeed procedurally defective as it did not comply with what was set out in Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. Even accepting that it was indeed procedurally defective, as I had explained to the Husband during the hearing, I was minded to deal with SUM 1769 on its merits given that the application was already before me. Any quarrel the Husband may have about not being served with a voluntary request for RFDIs is something best ventilated in costs submissions for SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to address the documents in respect of which the Wife was seeking orders for discovery which had been set out in her supporting affidavit for SUM 1769.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Item 1 was a request for documents evidencing the Husband’s salary and bonus details during his employment with [X] as well as his income tax statement. The reason for this, according to the Wife, was that the Husband’s salary and bonus details for 2017, 2018 and 2023 were missing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband’s position was that disclosure of these documents were not necessary because he had voluntarily disclosed his IRAS notice of assessment (“NOA”) for 2016 – 2023. The NOA would show his income for the year (including his salary and bonuses). In addition, the Husband also points out that his December 2023 payslip does state his net pay for the entire year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 1. These documents were relevant and necessary to determining the Husband’s means as well as ascertaining the size of the matrimonial pool of assets. The Husband is to disclose documents evidencing his salary and bonus details during his employment with [X] from May 2017 to August 2018, as well as his income tax statement from IRAS in 2024 showing how much he had earnt by way of salary and bonuses in 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I turn now to the Wife’s request in Item 2. This was a request for the Husband to produce statements from 7 bank accounts which, according to the Wife, belonged to him:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     UOB account ending -37;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Citibank HK account ending -89;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) account ending -33 and -51;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     OCBC account ending -001;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     China Merchant Bank account ending -484;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     UOB US account ending -9-1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Bank of Communication account ending -54.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the UOB account ending -37, it is clear from the statements disclosed by the Husband in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that the Wife was a joint account holder. She should therefore be able to obtain the statements sought. I disallow the request in respect of this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In relation to the Citibank HK account ending -89, the Husband had explained that this bank account was a custodian account of Tiger Brokers. This account was used to hold assets on the Husband’s behalf. The Husband had provided an email from Interactive Brokers, which was Tiger Broker’s clearing broker.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> That email stated that this Citibank account ending -89 was used to hold the Husband’s assets – this included a deposit of HKD 10,000 on 3 January 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Husband had therefore sufficiently explained why he could not produce the bank statements for the Citibank account ending -89. I therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In relation to the ICBC account ending -33 and -51, the Husband had produced a letter from ICBC, addressed to the Family Courts, stating the accounts which he had with ICBC. It is clear from that letter that the two accounts ending -33 and -51 were not in his name. I therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the OCBC account ending -001, the Husband had produced a letter from OCBC stating that the account had been inactive since 17 December 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given that the account was inactive since 2017, I disallow the Wife’s request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the Wife’s request for the China Merchant Bank account ending – 484, the Husband had merely stated that he owned no such account and did not know why the Wife would think that he owned such an account. The Wife, on the other hand, disclosed a screenshot which was allegedly from the Husband’s personal device, showing a transaction from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I have looked at the screenshot produced by the Wife. It shows a transfer of RMB 0.55 to [Y] (last digits -8484). The screenshot suggests that the account ending -8484 is not in the Husband’s name. I will therefore disallow the request for statements from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As for the UOB US account ending -9-1, the Husband had disclosed a screenshot showing that the latest statement was in July 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> While it is clear that that account had been dormant for some time, it is also clear, from that screenshot, that the Husband is able to produce the statement for July 2019. I therefore order that the Husband disclose the July 2019 statement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for the Bank of Communication account ending -54, the Wife is asking for statements before 27 July 2020 and after 27 July 2023 up to March 2024. The Husband has already provided some 3 years’ worth of statements (from 27 July 2020 to 27 July 2023). I do not think it is necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters that the Husband provide additional disclosure in respect of this account. The statements disclosed would give the Wife a picture of the comings and goings from this account. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request for these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife’s next request in Item 3 was for statements from the Husband’s Paylah, Union Pay, Alipay and WeChat pay accounts from 2015 – March 2024. In addition to this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to provide all “bank account details in China Mainland by using the enquiry function in Union Pay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband objects to this request. He says the Wife had not previously asked for it in either her 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> RFDI. The Husband also points out that he had disclosed past three years’ bank statements for his accounts in China as well as the stored value in his Alipay account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Given that the Husband had indeed provided his bank statements, these statements are not, in my judgment, necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. In determining whether the documents are necessary, the court assesses the importance and relevance of the documents sought and the hardship to the party seeking discovery that is likely to be caused by the non-production of such documents: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [24] citing <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [26]. In this vein, I add that there is no need for the Husband to account for every single cent in every single account under his name. The documents which the Husband has disclosed, and which he has been ordered to disclose, should allow the Wife and the court to determine his means and the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I come now to Item 4. This was a request for statements from several trading accounts which were allegedly held in the Husband’s name. The Wife wanted the statements from the time these accounts were opened till March 2024. The Wife’s requests were in relation to the following trading accounts in the Husband’s name:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Futu accounts ending -18 and -30;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Moomoo (Universal) account ending -89;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Moomoo (US) account ending -14;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     UOB Kay Hian Pte Ltd account ending -02;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Tiger Brokers account ending -39;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Interactive Brokers account ending -88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In addition, the Wife also wanted the Husband to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     provide all the bank accounts which had been used to fund these trading accounts;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     confirm and provide documentary evidence in respect of the statements, profit and loss, net value and positions of the financial instruments that the Husband had invested in; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     provide documentary evidence of shares and stocks that the Husband had yet to disclose – this included the name of each stock and share as well as the quantity and value of each individual stock held. If the stock had been disposed of, the Husband was asked to provide the date of disposal as well as the whereabouts of the proceeds received.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband objects to this request on the basis that the Wife did not ask for these statements in her RFDI.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4 for the reasons set out below. The Husband had already provided disclosure of the stocks held in his trading accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He disclosed that he had an account with Interactive Brokers, Tiger Brokers and Moomoo, as well as a Money Market Fund in China. The Wife had sought further disclosure in respect of these accounts – she essentially wanted the Husband to provide all the relevant statements since the opening of the account up till March 2024. Such disclosure was not, in my view, necessary given that the Husband had already provided the account statements up till the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As for the UOB Kay Hian account, the Husband had produced an email thread showing his attempt to get the statements from UOB Kay Hian.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It is clear from the correspondence that as of September 2018, the balance in that account was zero. It is also clear that the Husband had done all he could to produce the statements from this account. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Insofar as the Futu and Moomoo accounts were concerned, the Husband had also furnished correspondence from Moomoo’s customer service to support his explanation that all these accounts had been merged into a single universal account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and that he had already disclosed all the relevant statements. I accept his explanation and disallow the Wife’s request for these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, as for the additional requests that the Wife sought (above at [30]), that too is disallowed. How these accounts were funded would be clear from the bank statements that the Husband has already disclosed. In any event, the Husband also says that he had provided all the bank transfer records related to these stock accounts during the first two rounds of discovery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Insofar as the profit and loss statements as well as the value of the positions held are concerned, that would already be evident from the statements disclosed by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, as to the Wife’s blanket request for the Husband to disclose documentary evidence of the stocks and shares that he had yet to disclose, this was, in my view, a stab in the dark in the hope of striking gold. It is a principle of discovery that there must be <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought do indeed exist: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64] citing <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]). I have not been referred to any such evidence, nor is it apparent to me, from the evidential record, that there is such evidence. There is therefore no basis on which to order discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Item 5 required the Husband to confirm that he had not dissipated matrimonial assets by transferring them to his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This request appears to be framed as an interrogatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In any case, the Husband’s position is that he had already stated that he did not transfer any money to his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item. The request, as framed, was not something that could properly be asked for in discovery. In any event, the Husband had provided an answer to her query – the Wife is well entitled to dispute that answer, but the proper forum to do so is at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Item 6 was a request for the Husband to provide bank statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> According to the Wife, although the Husband had disclosed some bank statements in respect of these accounts, she had a basis for asking for additional statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For example, in relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, there was a large sum of money that had been transferred through that account prior to 2019. The Wife thus wanted the Husband to provide the statements from January 2017 to December 2018. She had produced a screenshot showing two large transfers of USD 38,433.91 and USD 64,511.49 and another similarly large transfer of some USD 30,000 just a few days prior.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I disallow the request in Item 6. The Husband had already disclosed almost three years’ worth of statements. It must be borne in mind that the hearing of the ancillary matters is not an exercise in forensic accounting, nor is it an opportunity to ask the Husband to account for every single cent that had travelled through his accounts over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     That said, in relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, I order the Husband to explain the reasons for this transfer and to (if applicable) state the account to which those sums had been transferred. The Husband shall also provide the relevant documents in support. Given that those were large sums which were being transferred and it is certainly relevant and necessary to know the reasons for those transfers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I shall deal with Items 7 and 8 together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Item 7 was a request for the Husband to provide “one year’s groceries statements”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Item 8 was a request for the Husband to provide documentary proof of the expenses for taking the child on overseas trips.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I disallow the request in Items 7 and 8. If the Husband takes the position that he has spent money on groceries for the household and on taking the child for holidays abroad, then he bears the onus of proving so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Item 9 was a request for the Husband to state the bank name and account number of the account that he had used to fund his trading accounts, and to highlight the records of the relevant deposit and withdrawal of funds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item. The Husband had provided his statements for both his trading and bank accounts. It would be clear from those statements how his trading accounts had been funded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I come now to the Wife’s request for interrogatories. In considering an application for interrogatories, I bear in mind the following two principles. First, that interrogatories are only ordered if they are relevant and necessary to the disposal of matters at the ancillary hearing. Second, the answer which is provided to an interrogatory only needs to be sufficient – the truth of the answer does not concern me: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [6] – [7] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to confirm that the bank statements were accurate and that he had not intentionally omitted any material factual information.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my judgment, it was not necessary for the Husband to answer this interrogatory. It was possible for the Wife to argue, based on the documents that had already been disclosed, whether the bank statements were accurate and whether the Husband had intentionally omitted any material information. I therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I come now to Item 2. This was a request for the Husband to confirm if he had ever tried to hide matrimonial property for the benefit of his mistress or any other external party of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The interrogatory, as framed, ran the risk of distracting parties from the main issues at the ancillary hearing (<em>ie</em>, the division of assets and maintenance). As I had explained to the Wife during the hearing, this was because there was no mention of adultery by either party as the basis for the divorce. The Wife subsequently clarified that what she wanted to know was whether the Husband had ever transferred assets out of the matrimonial pool and to whom they had been transferred to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The relevance of such an interrogatory is clear – it would have a bearing on the court’s assessment of the size of the matrimonial pool of assets. That said, I do not think that it is necessary for the Husband to answer this interrogatory. The Wife is already in possession of his bank statements as well as documents evidencing his income and statements from his trading accounts. These documents should give her a general picture as to the Husband’s finances and allow her to determine if he had been dissipating assets or hiding assets from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is therefore disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I come now to the Wife’s request in Items 3,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> 4,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> 5,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> 6,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and 7.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> These interrogatories required the Husband to explain various transactions and to provide details of the same (<em>ie</em>, the purpose of the transfer and the recipient).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Although the Husband objects to these interrogatories on the basis that the Wife had not sought them in her previous RFDIs, he had provided answers to all these interrogatories.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I have read the Husband’s answers and deem them to be sufficient answers in that he had set out details of the transfer, either in the explanation provided in the body of his reply affidavit to SUM 1769, or by reference to documents which he had exhibited. The Wife is entitled to dispute the truth of those answers, but this is not the proper forum for the ventilation of such arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I therefore make no order in respect of Items 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     These are the orders which I make:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out at [15] and [24] of this judgment, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his possession, custody or power, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In relation to the UOB account ending -5-8, the Husband shall also explain, on affidavit, the reasons for the transfers made on 6 and 12 April (as shown at Annex H of the Wife’s Affidavit in Support of SUM 1769) and to (if applicable) state the account to which those sums had been transferred. The Husband shall also exhibit the relevant documents in support of his explanation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by 1 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In addition to the above orders, parties are to file their submissions on costs of SUM 1769 by 16 September 2024. This should be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here should be taken as binding the judge hearing the ancillary matters claim, and the time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\"

Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       A wife sought monthly maintenance of $600 from her husband pending the resolution of their divorce. She did so by way of these proceedings, which she commenced in July 2023. Four months later, in October 2023, she sold $300,000 of securities that she owned and transferred $120,000 of the proceeds to her two adult children. She contended that she was unemployed, had to provide for the two adult children, and depended on the financial support of the husband. I declined to grant this application, and the wife has filed an appeal against this decision. I now provide my reasons for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The court in an application for such wife maintenance considers, at the outset, whether the husband had “neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her” (see s 69(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). If so, the court will assess the quantum of maintenance to be paid based on all the circumstances of the case, including the factors enumerated in s 69(4) of the Charter. Further, an application for wife maintenance that is pursued when divorce proceedings between the spouses are ongoing is an order for “interim” maintenance. The focus of such interim maintenance is the “immediate needs and necessities” of the wife. This is because the complete financial resources of the parties would not have been “fully fleshed out or substantiated until all preparations and filings for the ancillary matters have been completed”. Hence, the interim maintenance operates as “tide-over” sums that are temporary in nature and conservative in quantum (see <em>TEQ v TER</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17973-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 119</a> at [20]; see also <em>ARL v ARN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0142.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 142</a> at [32]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Before me, the wife claimed monthly expenses of $5,040.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This sum included generous estimates for food and groceries (which totalled $2,200); apparel and grooming (which totalled $450); travel and entertainment (which totalled $1,270); and an allowance for her parents at $400. The receipts that the wife exhibited in support of these claims revealed a lifestyle of dining at restaurants to the tune of $100–$200 each week and an affinity for tableware that cost up to $552 for set of a food tray and teacups. By the admission of the wife, these expenses were “extravagant for someone in [her] position”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Equally, too, this extravagance sat uneasily with the “tide-over” nature of interim maintenance that was sought in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife contended that she had to support her two adult children, who were pursuing university education in Singapore. But she did not provide any estimate for or breakdown of the amount to which she had to support them. Nor did she dispute that the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. There was little objective evidence that the reasonable expenses of either child exceeded this sum. This left little need for the wife to expend her financial resources on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Still, the wife had, after commencing these proceedings for interim maintenance, transferred $120,000 of her moneys to the two children. Even if she had done so in a bid to support the two children, there was no evidence that the reasonable expenses of the children consumed all or even most of the $120,000. This was especially when the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. With that $120,000, the wife could have supported herself for 200 months based on the monthly maintenance of $600 that she sought in these proceedings. Given the willingness of the wife to give such a large sum to the children when she had little need to do so and when the children had not made any demand for such a sum, it was difficult to see how the wife needed any interim maintenance to tide her through the resolution of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Although the wife was unemployed at the time of these proceedings, she was not without financial resources. By her own estimate, she owned up to $500,000 of securities at least up until October 2023, which was four months after she commenced her claim for interim maintenance. Hence, at least as of the time when these proceedings were commenced, the wife had ample financial resources with which she could have supported herself. On this basis alone, there was no justification to order the husband to provide interim maintenance for the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Even if the wife had sold $300,000 of her securities in October 2023, she continued to own a substantial quantum of securities. Although she had transferred $120,000 of the proceeds from that sale to the children, she would have retained $180,000 of those proceeds. The wife claimed that she had used this balance sum to repay debts but offered scant evidence for or details on those debts. It was thus unclear that the wife lacked the financial resources to maintain herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Ultimately, the touchstone for an assessment of maintenance is that of reasonableness. This inquiry transcended consideration of the parties’ expenses, financial resources, and conduct. On the facts, the wife could reasonably maintain herself with her own financial resources. Further, it was hardly reasonable for her to disenfranchise herself of $120,000, or 200 months of interim maintenance, after commencing these proceedings and when she had no necessity for doing so. It was thus unjustified to have the husband maintain her further.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>WAEIC at pp 11–12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>1NE at p 34.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-08-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)","title":"XCL v XCM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 75","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32108-SSP.xml","counsel":["VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-09-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCL v XCM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCL <em>v</em> XCM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCL — XCM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Divorce proceedings had concluded in 2011. The court had recorded a consent order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Clause 2 of that order provided that the Husband was to pay maintenance of $300 per month for each of the two children. The Wife has now applied <em>vide</em> SUM 1987/2024 (“SUM 1987”) to vary clause 2. To that end, she took out an application for discovery in SUM 2194/2024 (“SUM 2194”) and interrogatories in SUM 2193/2024 (“SUM 2193”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard SUM 2194 and SUM 2193 on 12 August and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that the provisions which govern the Wife’s application for variation of the consent order recorded are found in Part X of the Women’s Charter 1961 (<em>see Nalini d/o Ramachandran v Saseedaran Nair s/o Krishnan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0098.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 98</a> at [14]), the applicable rules that apply to discovery and interrogatories are found in Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. As is stated in Rule 63(2):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Rules 63 to 77 apply to all matters involving ancillary or financial relief, as the case may be, in any proceedings commenced by writ or originating summons under Part X of the Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The purpose of discovery and interrogatories is to ensure that the judge hearing the matter has all the available evidence needed to dispose of the case. In that vein, one must consider the relevance and necessity of the discovery and interrogatories sought, bearing in mind the issues that are likely to arise at the hearing of the substantive matter. Here, it appears from an affidavit which the Wife had filed,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that the main issue in her application for variation is whether there has been a material change in circumstances (see <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19435-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 196</a> at [11] – [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is with this in mind that I now turn to consider the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2194 – Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Item 1 was a request for the breakdown of the Husband’s monthly expenses with an amount for each item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This was, strictly speaking, not a request for the Husband to produce documents. It should have been framed as an interrogatory as opposed to being a request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Leaving this aside, the Wife’s request is indeed relevant to determining whether a variation of the maintenance order is warranted. A breakdown of the Husband’s expenses will go towards showing whether there has been indeed a material change in circumstances that warrant such a variation. I will therefore order that the Husband provide a breakdown of his monthly expenses and provide the relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I turn next to Items 2 and 3 which related to the Husband’s income. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 2: IRAS Notice of Assessment for the past 3 years;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3: Pay slips for the past 6 months</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I accept that these documents are relevant and necessary for the variation proceedings. They would cast light on whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances, such as whether the Husband had experienced a drastic increase in his income, that warranted a variation to the original maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 2 and 3 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I shall next deal with Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 together. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had debts (Item 4);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Court documents related to the Debt Repayment Scheme (Item 5);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Documents from the bank to prove allegedly incurred debts of $13,327.76 (Item 8);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with [J], [SC] Pte Ltd, [A] Pte Limited, [RC] Pte Ltd (Item 9);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with M1, Singtel and Starhub (Item 10);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $21,056.67 under “Hire Purchase” (Item 11);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave (Item 12).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the request in respect of Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. They would allow the Wife to assess whether the Husband indeed had such debts, and in that vein, consider whether may still be worthwhile pursuing her application for a variation of a maintenance order. Should the application proceed to hearing, these documents were certainly relevant and necessary to allowing the judge hearing the matter to determine the true state of the Husband’s financial affairs, and whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this vein, I will also allow the Wife’s request in Item 6 where she sought copies of the Husband’s bank statements for the past 3 months. These statements were, in my judgment, relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Husband’s financial circumstances and thus had a direct bearing on the Wife’s application for an upwards variation in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request in Item 7, which was for documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had been paying his mother a monthly sum as an allowance. The reason for this request was that the Husband had listed his mother as a dependent in the Consultation Form of [D]. Whether the Husband is indeed supporting his mother financially is relevant for the purposes of the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. It would give the court a fuller picture of the Husband’s financial obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s request in Item 7 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2193 – Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     These were the interrogatories as framed by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    State the reasons for incurring $13,327.76 as debts with the various banks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State the reason for engaging the services of 3 telco companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Explain why you had incurred an alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $7000 from the “Government”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $320 from [X] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $1800 from [Y] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The common thread binding these interrogatories is that the Wife wants the Husband to explain the reason for incurring these debts. During the hearing, counsel for the Wife had explained that the Wife wanted to know why the Husband had these debts because she did not want a situation where the Husband incurs debts and shirks his responsibility to provide for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I disallow the Wife’s application for interrogatories. These interrogatories were not, in my judgment, relevant to the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. The Husband’s reasons for incurring the debt were hardly relevant to the issue of whether there had been a material change in circumstances which warranted the upwards variation in the maintenance order that the Wife sought. What was relevant was the extent of the Husband’s financial liabilities, and to that end, I have allowed the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum up, the Wife’s applications in SUM 2194 for discovery is allowed in its entirety. Her application in SUM 2193 for interrogatories is dismissed.

As part of their divorce in 2021, they agreed, among others, that the Defendant was to provide maintenance at $500 for each of their two young daughters (“<b>maintenance amount</b>”). At the material time, the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter was 7 years old (D.O.B: xx April 2014) while the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter was 3 years old (D.O.B.: xx March 2018).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The terms of this agreement were recorded by way of a consent order (“<b>2021 Order</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In January 2024 (i.e., 2½ years later), the Plaintiff applied to vary the 2021 Order in relation to the Defendant’s maintenance of, and access to, their daughters (“<b>Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Following mediation in March 2024, the parties reached a compromise on some of the Plaintiff’s requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       At the hearing before me, the Plaintiff’s requests on the following were to be determined:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Defendant’s monthly maintenance of each daughter <em>be increased</em> from $500 to $2,500 (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> Request</b>”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Defendant is to <em>additionally</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)       Provide $800 annually for each daughter’s “school opening expenses, uniforms and schoolbooks” from 1 December 2024 (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Request</b>”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bear an equal share of the daughters’ “General Practitioner, emergency medical/hospitalisation and dental expenses” that are not covered by existing insurance policies (“<b>3<sup>rd</sup> Request</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff’s grounds for the above requests are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the living and educational expenses of her growing daughters had increased since the 2021 Order was made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, it was highlighted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter had been referred to the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”) for counselling for having suicidal tendencies.

The Plaintiff came to this view because his income was more than $10,000 monthly, excluding commissions and bonuses. Further, after the divorce, the Defendant was able to purchase a condominium (which she believed to be valued minimally at $1.26m) and a “<em>new</em> Mercedes Benz” (which she believed to be valued minimally at $332,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant objected to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Requests.

The Defendant wanted the 3<sup>rd</sup> Request to be phrased such that each party would be required to act expeditiously to make the relevant claims.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, the Defendant also wanted to make clear that there should be no double claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That Paragraph 3.1 of the Order of Court dated 30 September 2021 shall be varied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.1.1  Commencing from 1 January 2024 and thereafter on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of each month, the maintenance which the Defendant shall pay for [the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter] shall increase from S$500.00 per month to $900.00 per month.

In determining whether an application to increase child maintenance is reasonable, it would be appropriate to consider, among others, the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there has been a significant and unexpected increase in the child’s expenses: see e.g., <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<b><em>BZD</em></b>”) at [14]; <em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a> (“<b><em>TOC</em></b>”) at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the proposed increase in maintenance is fair given the parents’ current income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the paying parent can afford to pay the proposed increase in maintenance given his/her level of expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Having set out the applicable principles, I will now apply them to the present case. Given that the Plaintiff had sought to vary the maintenance amount, she bore the burden proving that the requirements in s 73 are met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">No significant increase in the daughters’ expenses since 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ current monthly expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To start, I note that the Plaintiff had sought a staggering five-time increase in the daughters’ maintenance – from <em>$12,000</em> annually<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> to <em>$60,800</em> annually.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><em>Instinctively</em>, such a scale of increase – within a short span of three years from the time of the 2021 Order – appears to be unreasonable. This is especially so given the absence of life-altering events (e.g., the development of a medical condition) during this period of the daughters’ lives. On scrutinising the Plaintiff’s list of the daughters’ expenses, I found several of them to be <em>in fact</em> excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, an appropriate quantification of the daughters’ current expenses is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Daughter (10 years old) – $1,497 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter (6 years old) – $1,029 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>For details of the above quantification, see <b><u>Annex 1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex 2</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ monthly expenses in 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The next step is to consider whether there had been a significant increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order. To do this, it is necessary to determine what such expenses were in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On this, the parties held the following divergent positions:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"42.4515096980604%\"><col width=\"29.8340331933613%\"><col width=\"27.7144571085783%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Monthly expenses in 2021</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1<sup>st</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(7 years old)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(3 years old)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Plaintiff’s case</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,950</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$865</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Defendant’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,697</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,577</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At this juncture, I digress to observe that based on the Defendant’s own case above, maintenance at $500 monthly for each daughter is <em>clearly</em> inadequate given their expenses in 2021. This amount is significantly less than 55.2% which the Defendant claimed should be his share of contribution to his daughters’ maintenance at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I did not find the divergence between the parties’ positions ($1,950 vs $1,697) to be significant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I preferred the Defendant’s position. I noted that the amount of $1,577 is <em>closer</em> (than $865) to the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses. This can explain why the parties had agreed in 2021 that the Defendant was to provide the <em>same</em> amount of monthly maintenance (i.e., $500) for each of their daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Finding</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given the above, I make the following finding:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,497) are lower than those in 2021. This is so based on both the Plaintiff’s case ($1,950) and Defendant’s case ($1,697).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,029) are also lower than those in 2021 (using the Defendant’s figure of $1,577).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to vary the maintenance amount <em>upwards</em> on the ground that there has been an increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance amount is unreasonable given the parties’ current income levels </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I now turn to the issue of whether the maintenance amount is reasonable given the parties’ current income levels. The parties accepted that their share of contribution to their daughters’ maintenance should be in line with their current relative income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s current monthly income</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, I first determined what the Defendant’s current monthly income was. On this, I noted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant’s pay package consisted of (i) fixed monthly salaries as well as (ii) payments under the employee referral scheme and bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between December 2023 to May 2024, the Defendant’s nett average salary was about $10,000 monthly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In February 2024, he received $125,602 in cash bonuses (“<b>Bonus</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Based on the Defendant’s IRAS Notice of Assessment 2021 to 2023, there is no evidence that such bonuses had been issued in these years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Before proceeding further, I wish to address a point raised by the Defendant. He submitted that the Bonus should be disregarded in assessing his income as these were variable and non-guaranteed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I disagree. The Bonus is clearly part of the Defendant’s income and is indicative of his earning capacity: <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [43]. Courts have typically considered a party’s bonuses when making and varying maintenance orders: see e.g., <em>Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0785.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 785</a> at [98]; <em>BZD</em> at [12]. The Charter does not ring-fence a party’s bonuses from being subject to enforcement of maintenance orders: see e.g., s 80 (definitions of “earnings” and “maintenance order”), s 81 to s 88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The real issue is <em>how</em> the Bonus should affect the calibration of the Defendant’s monthly income given that the bonus is variable and non-guaranteed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Plaintiff had approached this issue by simply adding the Bonus to six months of the Defendant’s most recent monthly income (where data was available) and then divided that figure <em>by six months</em>. I am unable to agree with this approach. It ignores the fact that the Bonus was given for <em>12 months</em> of work done in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing how to fairly factor the Bonus into the Defendant’s monthly income, I am of the view that the following is relevant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Between 2020 to February 2022 (i.e., the two-year period when <em>no</em> bonus was declared), the Defendant was working at <em>Bank A</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     From February 2022, he began working at <em>Bank B</em> (his current employer).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Bonus was declared two years later – in February 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the above, one option is to divide the Bonus over the <em>two-year period</em> that the Defendant was at Bank B. This will ensure that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Bonus is considered in computing the Defendant’s monthly nett income,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Address the Defendant’s concerns that future bonuses are variable and non-guaranteed, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Reflect the reality that he had received the Bonus only after two years of working at Bank B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The above approach is consistent with <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [41] to [43].

This assumes that he will continue to work at Bank B. In this regard, I noted that there was no evidence that he was leaving Bank B or would be retrenched.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     At this point, I digress to note that the Defendant’s current monthly income is <em>higher</em> than in 2021 when the 2021 Order was made. Based on his IRAS Notice of Assessment for 2022 ($109,881), the Defendant’s monthly income then was <b>$9,156.75</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Defendant’s current monthly income of $15,233 is <em>66% higher</em> than in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s share of child maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having established that the Defendant’s current monthly income, the next step is to determine what should be his share of child maintenance vis-à-vis the Plaintiff.

To recap, the Defendant’s monthly nett income (inclusive of Bonus) is <b>$15,233</b>. On the other hand, the Plaintiff’s monthly nett income (inclusive of bonuses) from December 2023 to May 2024 is <b>$11,892</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Comparing their nett monthly incomes, the Plaintiff to Defendant nett monthly income ratio should be <b>44</b>:<b>56</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It bears highlighting that the ratio of 44:56 is similar to the parties’ relative monthly income ratio at the time of the 2021 Order.

It is <em>unreasonable</em> to expect the Plaintiff to cover this shortfall – especially when her income is lower than the Defendant’s: s 73 of the Charter. In my view, the shortfall can be addressed by the Defendant paying an additional $400 (rounded up from $348.32) in monthly maintenance for his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Defendant can afford to pay the additional maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The issue now is whether the Defendant could afford to pay this additional maintenance. If the answer is no, then the Plaintiff would have to either (a) come up with the funds to cover the shortfall, or (b) reduce/forgo some of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expense items – e.g., food and groceries, vitamins and supplements for her skin condition, tuition and enrichment classes. The second option will be inconsistent with the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s welfare and interest: s 73.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the Defendant <em>can</em> afford to pay the additional maintenance. According to the Defendant, his current monthly expenses is around $12,747.72 to $13,177.72.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Given that his nett monthly income is $15,233, this means that the Defendant has a <em>monthly surplus of about $2,000</em>. This means that he can afford to pay an additional $400 to maintain his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter and still have savings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     It would be appropriate to order the increase in maintenance to commence from 1 January 2024. This is because many of the documentary evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expenses dated to the start of the year. Furthermore, there had been a serious shortfall since 2021: see [37] and [38] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Assuming that the Defendant had paid the maintenance amount up to the time of the hearing (September), this means that there is a shortfall of $3,600 in maintenance from January to September.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> I decided to give the Defendant until 1 December 2024 to pay the shortfall to the Plaintiff. This four-month grace period should give the Defendant sufficient time to raise these funds. After all, he has a monthly buffer of about $1,600 after paying the additional maintenance. If needed, the Defendant can also cut down on his monthly personal expenses – such as “F&amp;B” ($1,000) and “Networking &amp; Entertainment” ($500). I am confident that the Defendant will not shirk away from his financial responsibility towards his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For the above reasons, I varied the 2021 Order as set out in [9] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Parties are urged to agree on the costs of FC/SUM 85/2024.

Thus, her share of direct financial contributions was 13.2%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I next determined the parties’ ratio of indirect contributions. The Plaintiff became a stay-at-home mother about one year after the marriage. She cared for the children and did the housework, while receiving a sum of $500 from the Defendant monthly. When the children were older, the Defendant wanted the Plaintiff to return to the workforce, which she did in 2011. Notwithstanding that, the Plaintiff continued to do all the housework. The Plaintiff also cared for the Defendant when he was hospitalised.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> As the Plaintiff’s evidence was essentially undisputed, I accepted it. Bearing in mind the Plaintiff’s tremendous indirect contributions as a housewife and even after she started working, I attributed a ratio of 80:20 for indirect contributions in the Plaintiff’s favour.

After deducting the value of the Plaintiff’s assets in her sole name, the balance due to her from the Defendant is $511,080.50. As the Defendant had failed to participate in the proceedings, I took the view that the most effective way to implement the division was for the matrimonial home to be transferred to the Plaintiff, and I so ordered. The value of the matrimonial home is $455,000, which leaves a further balance of $56,080.50 payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, which I also ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not think that this was draconian or unfair to the Defendant. The Defendant has substantial sums in his CPF accounts, which he can use to purchase a property and finance his retirement. He also has substantial investments: see [8] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For completeness, I had doubts on the Plaintiff’s submission that the assets should be divided equally by applying the approach in <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) (which is applicable only to long single-income marriages), given that the Plaintiff worked for a substantial part of the marriage and was earning more than a token sum. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the outcome would not have been significantly different regardless of the approach adopted. It is important to note that the Court in <em>TNL</em> did not <em>mandate</em> equal division in all long single-income marriages; it spoke of a trend where the Courts were <em>inclined towards</em> equal division in such cases. Thus, the High Court in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a> observed at [70]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL v TNK</em> (at [38] to [42]), the courts have been inclined towards equal division in a number of cases involving long Single-Income Marriages. I have observed that in precedents identified by the Court of Appeal in decisions before TNL v TNK (see [42]–[44]) above, the proportion of division in long marriages where there were children tend to be around 35–50%</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The final ratio in this case falls squarely within in this range.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I also observe that because the Defendant did not participate in these proceedings, the Defendant did not file an affidavit of assets and means to disclose all his assets. Thus, there is a possibility that the list of assets above, which was compiled from the documents that the Plaintiff could obtain herself, may not be complete. To be clear, I did <b><u>not</u></b> award an uplift to the Plaintiff’s share on this basis, because I was not addressed on this point, but I mention this to provide further context to show that the division of the known assets is not unfair to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As the Plaintiff will receive a sizeable share of the assets, I declined to order spousal maintenance. The Plaintiff did not appeal against this aspect of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I also ordered costs fixed at $3,000 to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 16 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Written submissions at para 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 12 July 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>AOM at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>AOM at p 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>AOM at p 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>AOM at p 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>AOM at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>AOM at p 21A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>AOM at p 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>AOM at p 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>AOM at p 30.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>AOM at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>AOM at para 18.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure","Family Law – Procedure – Leave to make an interim judgment final"],"date":"2024-08-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1730 of 2022 (Summons No 2463 of 2024)","title":"XCN v XCO","citation":"[2024] SGFC 76","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32087-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff absent and unrepresented","Dharmambal Shanti Jayaram (Dharma Law LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCN v XCO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCN <em>v</em> XCO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32087-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 76</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

That Rule states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    A spouse may make an application to make final an interim judgment pronounced against him —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    without leave, if no application is made under paragraph (1) within the time specified in paragraph (3)(b); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    with leave, in any other case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on 28 March 2023. The ancillary matters were heard on 19 June 2024 and orders were made on 18 July 2024. The court’s orders in relation to the ancillary matters were extracted on 20 July 2024 <em>vide</em> ORC 3202/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant’s lawyers attempted to make the interim judgment final but were directed to seek the leave of court to do so. This is because the interim judgment had been granted based on the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 2463 came up before me for hearing. At the hearing, I had asked counsel for the Defendant, Ms Dharmambal Jayaram (“Ms Jayaram”) if Rule 96(6) stipulated that the leave of court to make the interim judgment final could only be sought after the time period for doing so as set out in the Rules (see Rule 96(1) and Rule 96(3)) had expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Ms Jayaram argued that this should not be the case. This would allow the Plaintiff to weaponise the rules of procedure by refusing to make the interim judgment final. If the interim judgment was not made final, the Defendant could not move on with her life – she could not remarry, and the money that she was entitled to under ORC 3202 could not be paid out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I agreed with Ms Jayaram’s argument. This was an appropriate case in which leave should be granted to the Defendant to make the interim judgment final. The Plaintiff had not participated in the previous hearings. He was absent at the hearing of the Defendant’s application for discovery in SUM 3324.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Further, despite being notified of the hearing dates, the Plaintiff did not participate in the subsequent case conferences,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> or the hearing of the ancillary matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Plaintiff’s conduct suggests that he had decided to not participate in the proceedings. Given this, it was equally likely that he would not take action to make final the interim judgment granted on his Statement of Claim. The result of such inaction would result in the Wife being unable to move on. This was clearly an untenable situation that could not be countenanced. I therefore granted the Defendant leave to make the interim judgment final.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This summons was heard on 23 November 2023 and orders were made.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the Case Conferences held on 3 January 2024, 14 February 2024, 27 March 2024, and 8 of May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the hearing on 19 June 2024 and 18 July 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for payment of fixed sum in monthly instalments should be interpreted to be a maintenance order or an order dividing matrimonial assets","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for monthly instalment payment rendered unworkable due to change in payor’s financial situation","Family law – Maintenance – Variation of maintenance order – Whether the loss of employment income and remarriage amount to a material change of circumstances"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 818 of 2020 (Summons No. 3761 of 2023)","title":"XCJ v XCK","citation":"[2024] SGFC 73","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32085-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Kee Lay Lian and Mr Shawn Teo (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the Plaintiff","Mr Yap Teong Liang (TL Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XCJ v XCK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCJ <em>v</em> XCK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32085-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 73</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

If so, should the Order be made?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Do Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order relate to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, or are they maintenance orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Has the Husband satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify his application to vary Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Can the Husband rely on his present circumstances – including his current employment status and/or remarriage – to vary Order 7(a) of the AM Order, and remove his obligation to pay the Wife maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I will address each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Can the Family Court make the Sale Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this Section, I will set out my views on the nature and scope of the Sale Order sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. In doing so, I will assume <em>arguendo</em> there was some evidential and/or legal basis to vary the AM Order. I will discuss further whether the AM Order should, in fact, be varied in greater detail at [71] to [88] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Husband referred this Court to r 540(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”) and submitted that this rule empowers the Family Court in Singapore to order the sale of immovable property (including those located in a foreign country). According to counsel, all the Husband needs to show is that it is “<em>necessary and expedient</em>” for such an order to be made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the matter, I am unable to agree with counsel’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, the Husband has confused the Family Court’s <em>power</em> to make an order of a certain nature (for eg. the sale of a property) with its <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the matter (or dispute) in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is trite that a court’s power and its jurisdiction refer to different matters – jurisdiction is the court’s “<em>authority, however derived, to hear and determine</em>” a dispute, whereas a court’s power is its “<em>capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party”</em>: see <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0258.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 258</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This is especially important in the present context as the Family Court was exercising its <em>matrimonial jurisdiction</em> when it made the AM Order after the Husband had invoked the Family Court’s jurisdiction by filing divorce proceedings pursuant to the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In hearing SUM 3671, I am also exercising the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear an application to <em>vary</em> the AM Order. Thus, if I am to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, I would be doing so as part of the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Court of Appeal in <em>UDA v UDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> was clear in holding that the Family Court’s power to divide assets “<em>or the sale of any such asset</em>” under s 112, WC operates only between the parties to the marriage and has force only “<em>between the parties</em>”;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> the Family Court cannot, in exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction, make orders against third parties in respect of assets and/or properties held by such third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this regard, the Husband’s reliance on r 540(1), FJR unfortunately misses the point as that is clearly a procedural rule. The Court of Appeal in <em>UDA</em> observed that where the jurisdiction which the party “<em>was advocating for did not exist</em>”, he or she “<em>could not create it by invoking a procedural rule</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In fact, the Husband’s own written submissions referred this Court to the High Court’s decision in <em>Tan Poh Beng v Choo Lee Mei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0163.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 163</a> where the High Court made the following apposite observations (at [19] of its judgment) in respect of O 31, r 1 of the Rules of Court 2014 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> to r 540, FJR):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19 […] The court’s power under both the SCJA and the ROC to order the sale of a property is contingent on there <b>being a substantive legal basis to justify the exercise of that power.

In this regard, it bears noting that both para 2 of the First Schedule and O 31 r 1 refer to the need for a “cause or matter” relating to any land or immovable property […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Rule 540, FJR does not provide the Family Court with an unfettered free-standing power. It can only be invoked against parties who are already within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As such, even if I were to assume that there were reasons justifying the variation of the AM Order, I do not have the power to make the Sale Order in respect of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is not disputed that neither the Husband nor the Wife is an owner of the Brussels Properties. Indeed, Order 1 of the AM Order <em>expressly</em> states that the Brussel Properties are being held by a foreign company, ie. [A] (“A Co”). In his affidavit, the Husband exhibited a company profile search of A Co indicating that the Wife, their daughter (ie. [V]), and one [T], are the administrators and members of A Co’s board.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In other words, if I were to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, a Family Court in Singapore would be effectively ordering a corporate entity in Belgium (ie. A Co) – of whom the Husband is neither an administrator nor board member, and the Wife being only 1 of 3 board members – to sell <em>the corporate entity’s</em> properties located <em>in Belgium</em> because of matrimonial proceedings between the Husband and the Wife in Singapore. I do not find that it is appropriate or proper for this Court to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is especially so given that Prayer 1 of SUM 3761 asks that this Court order the sale of the Brussels Properties “<em>and for the sale proceeds arising from the said sale to be </em><b><em>equally </em></b><em>distributed to the </em><b><em>Defendant and the Plaintiff</em></b> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]”; the Husband is asking this Court to compel A Co (who is not a party to the proceedings) to not only divest itself of its properties, but to also order that the sale proceeds therefrom be paid to the Wife and the Husband directly, despite neither of them being an owner of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During oral submissions, when I queried the Husband’s counsel on the legal effect and/or basis for this Court to order A Co to sell the Brussels Properties, counsel submitted that I could simply order that the Brussels Properties “be sold” and leave it to the Husband, the Wife and/or A Co to “sort out” amongst themselves how such an order would be implemented overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I am again unable to accept the Husband’s counsel’s submission, not least because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Counsel’s submission represented a significant departure from what was sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. Counsel was thus advancing a completely different case from that stated in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and what was written in the Husband’s own affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> without any prior notice given to the Wife (or her counsel) of such a change. This meant that the Wife was deprived of any opportunity to adduce the necessary evidence, or raise the relevant legal challenges, to address this new request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any case, I found such a request to be wholly ambiguous, and what was sought could hardly be called an “order” in the first place. It is unclear to whom is this order for sale directed against, and who is required to comply with it?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the reasons I have set out above, I find that it is not within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear disputes relating to (or make orders against) assets held by a third party, such as A Co. If I were to make an open-ended order for the Brussels Properties to be sold, only the Husband and the Wife would possibly be bound by such an order, yet neither of them is the legal owner of the said Properties which could unilaterally effect the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The uncertainty inherent in such an order would lead to difficulties in <em>enforcing</em> the same since it is not clear who is supposed to do what, in order to comply with a broadly worded order requiring “the sale of the Brussels Properties”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Accordingly, I do not find any legal basis to support the Husband’s application in this regard. Prayer 1 of the SUM 3761 is thus dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I should add that the Husband had referred, in his affidavit, to Orders 4 and 6 of the AM Order as orders which already envisaged the possible sale of the Brussels Properties, and that all he is requesting this Court to do is to intervene by making the Sale Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the presence of Orders 4 and 6 did not assist the Husband at all. If anything, Order 4 made clear that a sale of the Brussels Properties would only occur “<em>in the event that the parties agree</em>” and even then, the proceeds of any such sale would be made available to “<em>shareholders</em>” (and not directly to the Husband).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     These Orders do not justify the Court ordering the sale of the Brussels Properties without both parties’ consent, and certainly not for the vesting of any sale proceeds therefrom in the Husband or the Wife directly. For reasons I would come to below, this Court should be slow to intervene and effectively rewrite the parties’ agreement (as set out in the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Interpretation of the AM Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I will now move on to address the next question – ie. what is the nature of Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order. The parties took opposing positions on this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband argued that this Court should look at the “substance” of these Orders and find that they were “maintenance orders”, whereas the Wife submitted that these were orders which divided the parties’ matrimonial assets (which, for ease of reference, I will refer to as “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The distinction between maintenance orders and division orders is significant in the present case because the legal principles applicable to varying maintenance orders are different from those relating to the variation of division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Both parties accept that maintenance orders may be varied if there has been a material change in the parties’ circumstances: see ss 118 and 119, WC. On the other hand, if the orders in question were division orders, then this Court can only vary them if the Husband could show that the said orders were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM</em>”) at [22] – [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Accordingly, it fell on this Court to interpret/construe Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order in order to determine their nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, the High Court in <em>Seah Kim Seng v Yick Sui Ping</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17865-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 731</a>, made the following instructive observations on the relevance of the parties’ intention when considering the terms of a consent order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the fact that a consent order was recorded means that the intention of the respective parties may be relevant in a broad sense; such intention has to be considered in the light of the compromise required in reaching an agreement and expressed in the consent order. What matters ultimately is the common understanding between the parties. The court cannot ultimately substitute its own agreement in place of what the parties came to…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In <em>WWC v WWD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31395-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 17</a>, this Court had similarly observed that when interpreting consent orders containing terms drafted primarily by the parties (or their solicitors), the court can have regard to principles of contractual interpretation to aid in ascertaining the meaning of the words used in the consent order, being careful to explain that the use of such principles did not equate to the wholesale importation of the law of contract.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It was further observed that primacy should still be accorded to the <em>text</em> and <em>language</em> used in the said order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having considered the evidence, I find that Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order are division orders, and not maintenance orders. I reach this conclusion having regard to both the text and context of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Text of the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I start by addressing Order 3 of the AM Order. This was an order of some import as it referred to the total amount payable by the Husband (ie. EUR 3.9 million) and the manner this sum was to be paid (ie. in equal instalments totalling EUR 32,500 per instalment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the language and text of Order 3 as well as its preamble were clear – the Order expressly stated that the Husband must pay the Wife various amounts “<em>as a liquidation for the marital assets</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Given the express reference to the “<em>liquidation</em>” of the parties’ “<em>marital assets</em>”, I find that the Order could not possibly be read as (or bear the meaning of) an order relating to the payment of spousal <em>maintenance</em> or alimony as suggested by the Husband. It was an order relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s 112 of the WC. Indeed, s 112(5)(g) of the WC expressly allows the Family Court to order one party to pay another party a sum of money, and s 112(6) permits any order for the payment of money to be carried out in instalments. Such an understanding of Order 3 was consistent with both the language of Order 3 and the legal framework under which a division order can be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The language of Order 3a can be juxtaposed against Order 7a of the AM Order where the latter Order expressly provided for the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of EUR 2,000 per month “<em>as monthly maintenance</em>”, which may be increased after 2035 for the Wife “<em>to maintain a substantially similar lifestyle</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The references to “marital assets” (in the preamble of Order 3) and to the aggregate amounts payable (eg. “EUR 2,100,000” and “EUR 1,800,000” in Orders 3a and 3b, respectively) stand in stark contrast to phrases such as “<em>maintenance</em>” and/or the Wife’s “<em>lifestyle</em>” (as used in Order 7a). The parties’ deliberate choice to use different references and phrases demonstrated their understanding of the differences between maintenance orders and division orders, and that they had intended for Order 3 and Order 7 to have different legal effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As regards Order 5, this Order expressly referred to Order 3a and was also intended to be a division order. Put simply, Order 5 related to how the payment obligations in Order 3 would be extinguished with the effect that the debt cannot be claimed against the Husband’s estate upon his death.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Counsel for the Husband submitted that the reference in Order 5 to the existence of an insurance policy reflected the Husband’s attempt to ensure that his family (ie. the Wife and [V]) would be provided for in the event of his death. According to counsel, this could be seen as part of the Husband’s effort to “maintain” his family and was arguably a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I found this argument to be equivocal, at best.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     There was some force in the Wife’s counsel’s rebuttal that the references to an insurance payout could also support the view that the Husband recognised Order 3 as a division order. This is because had Order 3 truly been intended to be a maintenance order, the Husband’s obligation to pay maintenance would have extinguished automatically upon his death as a matter of law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and there would have been no need for him to provide for an insurance payout to prevent the Wife from making a claim for outstanding payments against his estate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     With respect to Orders 8 and 9a, I similarly find that they were not maintenance orders but were orders which are consequential to, or are meant to implement, the other division orders contained in the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Both Orders referred to the Brussels Properties and A Co (which is referred to as the “<em>Company</em>” in the AM Order) and addressed how the parties should regulate their conduct <em>inter se</em> given the Husband’s unique capacity as an <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares held by the parties’ daughter, [V] (an issue which I will address further below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Context and circumstances surrounding the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I next consider the context and circumstances at the time the AM Order was entered into by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As stated above, <em>both</em> parties were legally represented in February 2021 when the AM Order was made. Drafts of the orders were exchanged between both parties’ solicitors (including the parties’ themselves) leading up to finalisation of the draft consent order (which eventually became the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The various drafts and amended versions of the draft consent order, together with the covering emails sent by the parties and/or their solicitors, were exhibited in their respective affidavits filed in these proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> From a perusal of these documents, it was clear that one of the parties’ key concerns was the need to avoid the situation where Order 3 of the initial draft consent order would be classified as an order for “spousal support” thereby attracting tax implications in Belgium according to the Wife’s tax advisors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This concern was made known to the Husband, and it was eventually agreed between the parties that Order 3 would state that it related to the <em>liquidation</em> of the marital assets (or the concept of “<em>liquidation-partage du regime matrimonial</em>” under Belgian law), the latter phrase being inserted into a draft circulated <em>by the Husband</em> himself, in November 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In these proceedings, the Husband argued that the exchange of correspondence – including an alleged internal “explanation” as to how the <em>numerical figures</em> of EUR 2.1 million and EUR 1. 8 million in Order 3a and 3b, respectively, were calculated (written in “[ ]” in the later versions of the draft consent order circulated),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> supported his argument that parties intended for Order 3 to be a form of maintenance payments to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Again, I am unable to agree with the Husband’s argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Instead, I accept the Wife’s submission that the correspondence exchanged demonstrated that the parties had <em>specifically applied their minds</em> to how the draft consent order was to be crafted and that they intended for Order 3 to be a division order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Both parties had agreed that they did not want Order 3 to be deemed by the foreign tax authority as a maintenance (or alimony) order and had made sure that Order 3 was intended to be a division order so as not to attract any tax implications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     It follows that Order 5, which is meant to be read together with Order 3, was intended by the parties to also be part of the division of their marital assets, and not a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Indeed, accepting the Husband’s argument would be to accept that the parties had privately wanted (and understood) Order 3 to be a maintenance order but had intentionally drafted the clause in an obscure (or possibly, duplicitous) manner with the sole purpose to evade foreign tax obligations. This is a very serious claim involving fraud and dishonesty committed on both foreign tax authorities as well as the court. I am not persuaded that the documents submitted evidence the presence of any such conduct and/or intentions between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I thus find that both parties agreed for Orders 3 and 5 to be read and understood as division orders, and that was their intention when the AM Order was made in February 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I next address Orders 8 and 9. In considering the context under which these Orders were made, it is important to appreciate that by the time of the AM Order in February 2021, the Husband had already divested the legal ownership of his shares in A Co (and through that, the Brussels Properties) to [V].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     It was not disputed by both parties and their foreign law experts, that the Husband was and remains a <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares. The <em>usufruct</em> regime under Belgian law is such that the bare legal title/ownership of an asset (ie. the “<em>nue-propriété</em>”) may be vested in one owner while the right to use the property and enjoy the “fruits” of the same (for <em>eg.</em> dividends and income therefrom) are vested in another person (ie. the <em>usufructuary</em>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In the present case, [V] is the owner of the bare legal title, and the Husband is the <em>usufructuary</em>. Both parties’ foreign law experts have referred to Article 3.138 of the Belgian Civil Code, the English translation of which states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Usufruct grants its holder the temporary right to use and enjoy, in a prudent and reasonable manner, a property belonging to the bare-owner, in accordance with the purpose of the property and with the obligation to return it at the end of their right.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I accept the Wife’s expert, Ms C’s, explanation that the <em>usufruct</em> regime does not grant the <em>usufructuary</em> (ie. the Husband) the right to sell/dispose the assets subject to the <em>usufruct</em> (ie. the A Co shares in the present case). Where both the legal owner and the <em>usufructuary</em> agree to sell the asset in question, then the latter may be entitled to claim compensation arising from the loss of his rights, enjoyment and use of the asset (as a result of its disposal). The <em>usufructuary</em>, however, cannot act unilaterally to sell the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that Orders 8 and 9 were intended to be division orders regulating the use of the Brussels Properties and the shareholding of A Co.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     While both these assets are no longer legally owned by the Husband, he remains a <em>usufructuary</em> and has the right to make decisions over the use of A Co shares (and its fruits). This, in turn, necessitated the use of language such as “<em>the Defendant</em> [ie. the Wife] <em>will be allowed by the Plaintiff</em> [ie. the Husband] <b><em>(directly or indirectly)</em></b><em>, to become the tenant of the Brussels Properties…</em> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]” in Order 8. The need to provide for the possible “indirect” authorisation by the Husband arose from the fact that he is no longer the legal owner of the A Co shares, but its <em>usufructuary</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion of Interpretation of the AM Order and its consequence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For the foregoing reasons, I find that Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 were orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets, and <em>not</em> maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     For completeness, the Husband did not raise the existence of any mistake, misrepresentation nor did he claim that the AM Order was procured by fraud. In any case, such a claim would also have been difficult to maintain given that both parties were represented by solicitors at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Accordingly, contrary to his counsel’s submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> the Husband cannot rely on ss 118 or 119, WC as the legal basis to vary Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order; this Court cannot vary these Orders because of an alleged “<em>material change in circumstances</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Instead, the Husband can only rely on s 112(4), WC and must demonstrate that these Orders were “unworkable” or have become “unworkable”, as held by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The AM Order is not unworkable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     At the outset, in considering whether Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 of the AM Order were (or have become) unworkable, I observe that the Husband’s counsel did not include in their written submissions any legal arguments on the issue of unworkability. Presumably, this is because the main plank of the Husband’s case is that he is entitled to rely on alleged material changes in his circumstances to vary the said Orders (which I do not accept, for the reasons set out above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Nevertheless, counsel did indicate, during the hearing of SUM 3761, that they are relying on broadly the same grounds (ie. a change in the Husband’s circumstances) to show that the Orders have become unworkable. I also take into consideration the fact that the Husband’s affidavit did mention (albeit in passing) that the terms of the AM Order were “<em>unworkable</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I am therefore satisfied that was no prejudice being caused to the Wife and/or or that she had been taken by surprise by the Husband’s claim that the AM Orders have become unworkable. Indeed, the Wife’s written submissions specifically addressed the issue of the AM Orders’ unworkability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     That said, having considered the matter, I do not find any of Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 to be unworkable (whether at its inception, or that they have become unworkable due to subsequent events). I therefore see no basis to vary any of these orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     To begin with, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em> was careful to explain that the power under s 112(4), WC does not give a court <em>carte blanche</em> to vary an order and that the power must be exercised only in exceptional situations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal further held as follows (<em>AYM</em> at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    However, even assuming that the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court has not been completely effected or implemented, there still remains the issue as to the <em>grounds</em> on which the court would vary an order already made. <b>In our view, the fundamental importance of finality in the context of the division of matrimonial assets would also apply here</b>. To this end, we are of the view that the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets <em>only</em> where the order was <em>unworkable</em> or <em>has become unworkable</em> (<em>but before</em> it has been fully effected or implemented). We would however, point out, parenthetically, that the courts would not look favourably upon frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of court, which applications would be subject, <em>inter alia</em>, to the appropriate costs orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In the present case, there was nothing in the Husband’s affidavits which suggests that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were unworkable <em>ab initio</em>. In fact, the Husband had complied with those orders in the years following the making of the AM Order, making them clearly workable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> I therefore understood the Husband’s case to be the narrower claim that the AM Order has become unworkable due to subsequent events – ie. his loss of employment and his remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     As regards when new and/or subsequent circumstances can cause a division order to “become unworkable”, the Court of Appeal held that the new circumstances which have emerged since the order must “<em>so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which is radically different from what was originally intended.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78      <em>AYM</em> was a case where a husband whose business had failed, and who claimed that he had been unable to find a job, applied to vary a division order made by consent. The consent order provided for the parties’ matrimonial property to be sold only after 6 years and for the sale proceeds to be distributed between the parties thereafter, with the wife obtaining a larger share. The husband sought orders for the property to be sold within 3 months, and for the sale proceeds to be <em>inter alia</em> divided equally. Both the District Judge and the High Court dismissed the husband’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In upholding the lower courts’ decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the variation of the consent order, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    Turning to the facts of the present appeal, we agree with the Judge’s decision. It is clear, in our view, <b>that the change in circumstances which the Husband prayed in aid fell far short of the radical change in circumstances</b> referred to above (at [25]) and did not amount to the order becoming unworkable. <b>Even if business failure and a loss of income amounted to a “material change in the circumstances” sufficient to justify a variation of an order for maintenance, they did not suffice in the present case to justify the invocation of s 112(4) in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned</b>. It should also be noted that the order concerned was the result of a <em>consent order</em> between the Husband and the Wife (and see generally above at [15]). Indeed, the Husband was, in the final analysis, merely attempting to obtain a further amount because the matrimonial asset concerned was now worth more than what the parties had originally thought (see above at [3]). <b>Such attempts to undermine the finality of orders with regard to the division of matrimonial assets are wholly undesirable as well as unmeritorious and are, indeed, the very antithesis of the rationale underlying such orders in the first place, and aptly demonstrate the dangers of a wide interpretation of s 112(4)</b>. If, indeed, he had suffered a loss of income which amounted to a material change of circumstances, his proper course should have been to seek to vary the order for the payment of maintenance, rather than to seek to reopen the order with regard to the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In my view, the alleged changes in circumstances relied on by the Husband, like those referred to in <em>AYM</em>, fell far short of what was needed to vary a division order made by consent (ie. the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Even if I were to accept that the Husband had lost his employment, and was unable to find a suitable job thereafter, the alleged change in his employment situation was simply not sufficient to justify varying the carefully negotiated division orders set out in AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     To recapitulate, the evidence tendered by the parties showed that they had reached an agreement on the terms of the divorce (and the eventual draft consent order) after a long period of negotiations between the parties and their respective solicitors. This negotiated settlement, which was reached early in the proceedings (before any discovery and/or financial disclosures was ordered), meant that the draft consent order reflected the bargain struck between the parties without the need for either of them to undertake an extensive investigation of each other’s assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It was within this context that the Husband had agreed to provide the Wife with the amounts stated in Order 3 as being <em>inter alia</em> her share of the parties’ overall matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In this regard, Choo J’s observations in the recent decision of <em>WRP v WRQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31044-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 12</a> are apposite:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…Although the idea of sanctity of contract is not applied directly in matrimonial proceedings as if they were commercial enterprises, weight is given to the negotiated settlement of the parties. <u>Much give and take are involved in reaching such settlements, and the court should keep this in mind lest it gives more to the taker by taking more from the giver, contrary to the parties’ intentions</u>…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Put another way, the Husband’s application to vary the AM Order and change the amount payable to the Wife or the period/mode in which payment is to be made to her, is effectively a request for him to rewrite the carefully negotiated agreement between the parties even though it is not clear what was the exact “give-and-take” which the parties had agreed to when they entered into the original settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     As regards the Husband’s remarriage, I find that this is not a valid basis to seek a variation of the AM Order. Indeed, given the Husband’s decision to marry his current wife on 3 May 2021 (which was less than 1 month after the Certificate of Final Judgment was issued on 12 April 2021),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> he would have been fully aware of his legal obligations under the AM Order and cannot rely on his decision to remarry as a basis to re-write the terms of his divorce which was finalised just one month before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Lastly, insofar as the Husband relied on the Wife’s alleged actions arising from the sale of the Swiss property (referred to in Order 2 of the AM Order) or her actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> A Co’s bank account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that these were matters which, at their highest, relate to the parties’ compliance with the AM Order or the <em>enforcement</em> of the AM Order; they were not justifications for its variation. The difference between the enforcement of a court order and the need for its variation was a matter which the Husband clearly understood, having referred to the same in his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In reaching the conclusions above, I have assumed <em>arguendo</em> that the Husband was (and remains) impecunious and/or lacked the ability to draw an income similar to what he was earning in February 2021. This assumption was made to illustrate that even if the Husband’s circumstances had indeed changed (as he had alleged), the AM Order had not become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     However, for the reasons set out at [98] below, I find that the Husband has not sufficiently discharged his burden to prove any alleged change in circumstances to justify a variation of the AM Order on account of alleged unworkability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order 7 of the AM Order should not be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In this Section, I will address whether Order 7a of the AM Order (which both parties accept was meant to be a maintenance order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>) should be varied because of the Husband’s alleged change of circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     In respect of this issue, the Wife submitted that the Husband did not substantiate his claim that there was an alleged change in circumstances given his “[failure] <em>to produce any evidence related to his bank accounts, investments accounts and/or other related information of his financial resources, including how he is funding his own monthly expenses and that of his current wife and child</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I agree with this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In my view, the lack of evidence from the Husband was significant and inimical to his claim that he was (or remains) in dire financial straits. Being the applicant in a variation application, the burden fell on the Husband to prove his inability to meet his maintenance obligation, and he failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I do not agree with his counsel’s argument that the Court must accept that there has been a material change in the Husband’s circumstances simply because it is an allegedly “<em>incontrovertible fact</em>” that the Husband’s income has changed since the time of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Even if I am prepared to accept that the Husband’s:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_a\"></a>(a)     latest of income tax Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2023 shows that he had earned approximately $500,000 that year, as compared to the $2.1 million annual income he had earned in 2021; and/or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_b\"></a>(b)     current affiliation with [NWA Co] was merely on an <em>ad hoc</em> unremunerated basis,</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>that did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the Husband had proved his case that he was unable to meet his maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     As the Husband’s own counsel noted in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> the Court of Appeal in <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<em>BZD</em>”) emphasised that “[i]<em>n examining the question of material change in circumstances, the inquiry is not simply whether there has been any material change per se since the</em> [maintenance order]. <em>The change must be sufficiently material such that it is no longer fair to expect the status quo to remain</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     To ascertain whether it is fair for the Order 7 (or any part thereof) to remain, the Court would have to undertake a proper and holistic assessment of the Husband’s current financial situation to determine whether he can still afford to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In particular, s 114(1), WC expressly provides that when determining the amount of maintenance to be paid to a former wife, the court must have regard to all circumstances of the case including “<em>the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has…</em>”. It follows that when deciding whether to reduce (or, in this case, completely remove) the Wife’s entitlement to spousal maintenance in the AM Order, the Court must similarly consider the Husband’s overall financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I thus agree with the Wife’s submission that “<em>there</em> [was] <em>no evidence to support</em> [the Husband’s] <em>contention that his financial resources have been completely depleted</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> In fact, the Husband did not provide <em>any evidence</em> as to how much money he currently has. Accordingly, I do not find that he has proven that there has been any <em>material</em> change of circumstances which warrants the variation of Order 7 of the AM Order – an order which requires him to pay <em>inter alia</em> EUR 2,000 per month to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In conclusion, I find that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were orders for the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. These Orders (or any part thereof) can only be varied, pursuant to s 112(4) of the WC, if the Husband can demonstrate that they were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable. The Husband has failed to do so, based on the evidence he had submitted in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    It follows that there is no basis for the Court to now delete the aforesaid Orders from the AM Order, or for the Court to make a free-standing order relating to the sale of Brussels Properties and/or to distribute the proceeds therefrom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    With respect to Order 7 of the AM Order, although this was a maintenance order which could be varied pursuant to ss 118 and 119 of the WC, I find that the Husband did not discharge his burden to prove the existence of a material change of circumstances and there is similarly no basis to vary the provision of spousal maintenance stated therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Accordingly, the Husband’s application <em>vide</em>.

In the present matter, the Defendant Father seeks to appeal against my refusal to lift a suspended committal order against the Plaintiff Mother. The trouble began in August 2020, which was the last time the Father had substantive access with his son, now a teenager of nearly 14 years (referred to as the child, or “A” in quoted extracts). The Father had applied for a committal order on 3 March 2022, and after a bitterly fought trial, I granted a suspended order of committal against the Mother on 9 February 2023 in FC/ORC 1295/2023 (“the Committal Order”). The Mother was directed therein to exercise all reasonable effort to ensure the presence of her child at the handover for access, on pain of a $5,000 fine should she fail to do so. While the Mother managed to produce the child on some occasions since the Committal Order, substantive access never occurred as the child refused to leave the premises with the Father. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Father filed FC/SUM 3087/2023 (“the Application”) on 26 September 2023 to lift the suspended Committal Order against the Plaintiff Mother, on the basis that she had failed to provide access on 27 occasions during seven months from February 2023 to August 2023. The Father also sought for the fine of $5,000 provided for in that the Committal Order to be substituted with a term of imprisonment of four weeks. For good measure, his position had escalated at the end of trial to requesting the court to reverse care and control of the child to his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 30 April 2024, I found that the Father had not proven that the Mother was in breach of the Committal Order and dismissed the Application. The Father filed an appeal against my decision on 13 May 2024. I now provide my detailed grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is apposite to trace the complicated background between the parties to better appreciate the context behind this latest round of litigation. The parties were married in 2007 and filed for divorce in 2011. Interim judgment was granted on 28 May 2012. Parties had agreed by consent for care and control of the only child of the marriage, a boy born in 2010 and then aged nearly three years, to be granted to the Mother, with supervised access to the Father during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays, subject to a review after six months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father was back in court in 2013, applying for a variation of the ancillary orders on division and access. On 18 November 2013, the court varied the ancillary orders (in ORC 17253/2013), granting assisted access twice a week (once during the weekday and once during the weekend), subject to further review. In the review held in 2014, the parents agreed by consent for the Father to have weekday dinner access each week, weekend access every alternate Friday evening to Sunday evening, and alternating public holiday access (subject to the Father having access on Deepavali and Vesak Day and the Mother having access on the Hari Raya holidays).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Disaster then struck. The Mother and Child were involved in an accident, and both were hospitalised with serious injuries. In 2015, the Father applied (in FC/SUM 997/2015) to vary the child orders to obtain sole care and control of the Child. In the course of lengthy litigation, a series of interim orders were given that directed the Mother to provide access to the Father every Friday evening to Sunday evening, by way of assisted transfer. At a hearing on 20 January 2016, the Mother was warned by the court that should she continue to deny access, care and control may be reversed. The Father’s application for reversal of care and control was eventually dismissed on 1 March 2016, with access varied to alternate weekends (Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm), and daytime Sunday access on all other weekends from 9 am to 9 pm, as well as weekly access on a weekday from 6-9 pm. At a review on 23 May 2016, the court fixed the weekday access on Monday, and again warned the Mother that if the situation did not improve, reversal of care and control would be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father appealed against this decision (in HCF/DCA 117/2016), and after attempts at mediation, the orders given were varied by the High Court on 25 September 2017 (“the 2017 Order”, which was only extracted subsequently as HCF/ORC 13/2022). The 2017 Order contains the current applicable access orders. Its terms are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Overnight weekend access every alternate week from Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm, and on other weekends, access from Sunday 9 am to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Dinnertime access on Monday 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Telephone/skype/facetime access every evening between 7 pm to 7:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Access on Father’s Day and the child’s birthday on alternate years beginning 2017 from 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Alternate public holiday access, with access to the Father for Deepavali. No access to the Father if his access falls on the eve or actual day of Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Haji.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father is to pick up the child from the Mother’s residence at the lift lobby and return the child to the Mother’s residence thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_g\"></a>(g)     No cancellation of access by the Mother even if the child has a medical certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The Father has overnight access for half of school holidays beginning November/December 2017, save for the last week of December.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       A period of normalcy then followed. Access did occur with a fair degree of regularity thereafter from September 2017 to about August 2020. The parties (and their families) however continued to bicker, and matters came to a head with police reports filed over altercations at the handover of the child on 16 and 23 August 2020. The Father did not have substantive access to the child after those dates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This set the stage for the present round of litigation. The Father filed for committal on 3 March 2022, for breaches of access committed from 22 October 2017 to 4 November 2021. Over the course of a protracted and bitterly fought committal hearing, the court made attempts to repair the relationship by giving a series of interim directions for the parties to resume access in good faith. When access failed to materialise, the court directed interim access to be attempted over three hours at a nearby mall. This attempt likewise did not succeed. Finally, on 2 December 2022, after a Judge and Child Session held with the assistance of a court family specialist, interim directions were given for video call access twice a week for no less than 15 minutes per session. There was a glimmer of hope with remote access, which proceeded over some occasions (on 24 and 29 December 2022), with direct communications over WhatsApp taking place between the Father and child over the December 2022 school holidays. Nevertheless, no substantive access was achieved, and the Father persisted with the committal action.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 9 February 2023, I found the Mother guilty of contempt of court in relation to the 2017 Order by failing to take reasonable steps to facilitate the Father’s access on 38 occasions, over a period from 2 October 2017 to 4 November 2021. A fine of $5,000 was imposed in respect of these breaches, with the order of committal suspended pursuant to Rule 763 of the Family Justice Rules on the following conditions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother complies with the terms of access provided for in HCF/ORC 13/2022 dated 25 September 2017;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother exercises all reasonable effort to ensure that the child is present at the lift lobby of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of her residence when handing over the child for access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is to inform the Father at the earliest possible opportunity should she be unable to ensure that the child so complies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties and the Child shall attend counselling by the FAM/DSSA Centre, which shall commence no later than 31 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In my brief grounds of decision (at [4]), I also exhorted parties to avoid further litigation, which would be counterproductive to the restoration of the father-child relationship:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Nevertheless, I do urge parties to exercise patience and forbearance in future arrangements in relation to access. The child is now aged 12 and has a mind of his own, and while it is clearly the Mother’s responsibility to exercise all reasonable effort to compel him to comply with access terms, it would be counterproductive to do so at every turn upon the threat of further committal action against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Unfortunately, this advice was not heeded. Frustrated at the lack of substantive access since the Committal Order in February 2023, the Father filed the present Application some seven months later on 26 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Evidence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The parties have each filed an affidavit in the Application:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father filed his supporting affidavit on 6 October 2023 (“F1”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother filed her affidavit in reply on 19 January 2024 (“M1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Application was heard over three half day trial fixtures on 29 January, 6 and 19 March 2024, with submissions and decision rendered on 30 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I would also note for the record that on the day fixed for submissions, counsel for the Mother requested for a second Judge and Child session to be conducted with the child (the first session having been conducted earlier on 2 December 2022 in the course of the committal proceedings), or in the alternative, to allow the child speak in open court about the occasions of access. I declined to accede, as the hearing had already been concluded with submissions tendered, and no advance notice had been given of such an application. Nevertheless, I did direct for there to be a meeting between the Father and the child in the presence of a court family specialist, with the hope that some progress toward sustainable access be made at the eleventh hour. However, no headway was made at this discussion, and decision was therefore rendered by the court later that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father initially claimed that access had been denied over 27 occasions from 11 February 2023 to 27 August 2023. In the course of trial, the Father admitted that he did not actually attend for access on two of these dates (4 March 2023 and 2 April 2023), and withdrew his allegations accordingly. The matter thus proceeded on denial of access over 25 occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father’s case was that out of the 25 occasions, the child did turn up for seven occasions at the second floor lift lobby outside his residence as directed. However, on all those occasions, the child decided not to leave with the Father. The Father further alleged that the child did not turn up for access on the remaining 18 occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father alleges that the Mother had not taken all reasonable effort to compel the child to go through with access. He challenged the Mother to show she had taken such efforts, and pointed out that the Mother had undermined him in her admission that she had affirmed the child’s negative sentiments about the Father by agreeing that the Father was “stupid” and “dumb”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father also alleges that the Mother’s actions had alienated the child from him and worsened their relationship. He asserts that the Mother must have shown the child messages from the Mother to the Father which alleged that he was a lousy father, that he was dumb, bankrupt and a fool. The Father came to this conclusion on the basis that the child had access to the Mother’s phone and could view her messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. He posits that there cannot be any other reason why a child would otherwise reject a parent with whom he previously enjoyed a good relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother denied that she had been in breach of the terms imposed in the Committal Order or the underlying access terms in the 2017 Order. She relies on four arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     First, in relation to the seven occasions where the child had turned up for access at the lift lobby outside their home, the Mother claims it was the unpleasant manner in which the Father spoke to the child on these occasions which made the child turn back and refuse to continue with access. She submitted video recordings from her home CCTV camera with accompanying transcripts to substantiate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Second, the Mother submits that on occasions where the Father turned up too early or too late for access without sufficient notice, no amount of reasonable steps could be taken to compel the child to turn up for access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Third, after the harsh words exchanged by the Father with the child in their final meeting on 21 May 2023, it was impossible for the Mother to take any reasonable steps to compel the child to go for access, as he was old enough to make his own decisions and had a mind of his own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Fourth, on one occasion (19 March 2023), the Mother informed the Father that the child could not turn up for access as he had fever after taking his Covid-19 booster shot. While she acknowledged that the 2017 Order specified that access should not be cancelled even with a medical certificate, she interpreted that the Father had acquiesced to this cancellation of access as he did not object at the material time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     It is well established that the standard of proof for contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, per <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18910-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1</a> at [85]. As regards the requisite <em>mens rea</em> to establish breach of court orders, the applicant need only prove that the conduct of the party in breach was intentional and that the party knew that such conduct was a breach (at [86]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When determining whether there has been a breach of the Committal Order or the terms of access, a two-step approach is generally adopted, per <em>UNE v UNF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23079-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 9</a> (“UNE”) at [3], citing <em>PT Sandipala Arthaputrav STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</em> and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22139-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 828</a> (“PT Sandipala”) at [46]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the court would decide what exactly the order of court required the alleged contemnor to do. In determining what the order of court required, the court will interpret the plain meaning of the language used, and any ambiguity would be resolved in favour of the person who had to comply with the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the court would determine whether the requirements of the order of court had been fulfilled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It is also clear that the court has a broad discretion, if it decides to lift the suspended committal order, to sentence the contemnor for essentially a committing a <em>further</em> contempt of court, per <em>Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0218.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 218</a>, at [68]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Nonetheless, as a matter of principle, it is clearly justifiable that a court has a broad discretion in sentencing a contemnor who has breached the terms of a suspended order for committal. When an order for committal is suspended on certain terms and conditions, a breach of those terms and conditions by the contemnor is, in principle, disobedience of an order of court, and therefore a further contempt. Since the court has a complete discretion in sentencing contemnors (see [56] above), it must obviously have the same discretion in sentencing repeat contemnors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s obligations in respect of the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the purposes of the present Application, it is important to note that the Mother’s duty is not to <em>guarantee</em> that the Father has substantive access to the child. I interpret the scope of the Mother’s obligation to comply with the terms of the Committal Order, read with the 2017 Order, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother is to comply with the terms of access provided for in HCF/ORC 13/2022 dated 25 September 2017, the material points of which are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Overnight weekend access to be granted to the Father every alternate week from Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm, and on other weekends, access from Sunday 9 am to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Dinnertime access on Monday from 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Alternate public holiday access, with access to the Father for Deepavali. No access to the Father if his access falls on the eve or actual day of Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Haji.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother is to exercise all reasonable effort to ensure that the child is present at the lift lobby of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of her residence when handing over the child for access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is to inform the Father at the earliest possible opportunity should she be unable to ensure that the child so complies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Access shall not be cancelled by the Mother even if the child has a medical certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It should be noted that the burden of proof lies with the Father, to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt, that the Mother is in breach of the <em>specific</em> obligations cited above. This bears highlighting because at various portions of his case, the Father makes the argument that it is incumbent on the Mother to show that she has satisfied her obligations under the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order. This is not correct, as it is the Father who bears the burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Mother had complied with the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 1 – Occasions where the Child turned up for access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It was undisputed that there were seven occasions out of 25 where the child had indeed turned up for access at the second floor lift lobby outside his residence. These were on 18 February, 26 February, 11 March, 25 March, 8 April, 7 May and 21 May 2023. It was also not disputed that the child refused to leave with the Father for substantive access on these occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I did not find any basis to establish a breach of court orders on these seven occasions. The Mother’s <em>specific</em> duty was to produce the child for the purposes of access at the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor lift lobby, and this was done on the seven occasions in question. Figuratively speaking, her duty was only to bring the horse to the trough. It was the Father’s responsibility to make sure the horse drank of the water.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Over the course of trial, the Father was unable to find specific proof that the Mother had done anything to undermine his opportunity for access. His entire case on these seven occasions rests on the fact that access had been proceeding fine (i.e. prior to August 2020), and that he had had a good relationship with his son to that date, hence any failure of access could only be attributed to the fault of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As pointed out, the Father’s reasoning is flawed as the threshold to be met is that of proof beyond reasonable doubt. There was no basis to assume the fault lay with the Mother. Quite to the contrary, there are to my mind two clear reasons why the Father-child relationship had turned south following the events of 2020. The first is that the child clearly has a mind of his own, a fact which I observed during the Judge and Child session held on 2 December 2022 in the course of the committal proceedings, when the child was on the cusp of teenhood at about 12 years of age. At that time, the child was clearly aware of the impact that the protracted litigation had on his Mother, which was unfortunately complicated by the post-accident trauma experienced by the Mother. It was clear to me that the escalating tension and acrimony between the Father and Mother over the years, culminating in the altercations which took place in August 2020 and the ensuing committal proceedings filed by the Father, was the root cause why the child had turned away from his Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The second reason evident to me for the decline in the paternal relationship is that even after obtaining a Committal Order in his favour, the Father refused to let go of the hurt of the past. Rather than engaging the child afresh and focusing on the needs and wants of the child, he seemed more intent on triangulating the child in his ongoing conflict with the Mother. This persistent attitude of the Father is prominently displayed in the clips captured by the Mother’s home CCTV camera of his interactions with the child at the lift lobby on six of the seven occasions when the child turned up for access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.

This would hardly have engendered a positive reaction from the child, given the already tenuous state of the relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father’s response to the above transcripts was to question the veracity of these recordings, claiming that they were edited by the Mother. However, having heard the Mother’s explanation on how she had downloaded the clips from her home CCTV camera, I did not find any reason to doubt their authenticity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I have included the transcript of these videos above to demonstrate how the Father’s assumption that his relationship with the child was soured solely by the Mother’s alienation is fatally flawed. Instead of focusing on showing love and care for the child, and engaging the child positively on his interests and wants, the Father has instead chosen to use these precious moments of access to resurrect the ghosts of the past, which in turn elicited rude or nonchalant responses from the child. I do hope that the Father reflects on and reviews his behaviour on these occasions, so that future opportunities for access can start off with grace, forbearance and forgiveness, and evince a sincere demonstration of his care and affection for the child, rather than rehashing a litany of past hurts and grievances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 2 – Occasions where the Father did not attend for access at the appointed time</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother contends that on 10 occasions, access did not occur because the Father had arrived either too early or too late for access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I summarise the 10 occasions in question below, and note that the Father was at least 15 minutes late on all of these occasions. In the most egregious instance, he was a full six hours late. Further, despite his own tardiness, on some of these occasions, the Father had threatened to leave within five minutes if the child did not emerge.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\"

occasions which were withdrawn from the Father’s case, he had effectively stood up the child. On 4 March 2023, the Father informed that he would come at 2 pm but never arrived. On 2 April 2023, the Father did not even message to say he was not coming, and simply did not turn up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To my mind, a grace period of 15 minutes would have been fair under normal circumstances. Given the sensitivities involved and the already protracted litigation in this matter, it would have behoved the Father to turn up on time, or at least to apply the same standards (i.e. five minutes’ grace period) that he demanded of the child on himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On these occasions, mindful of the already difficult state of relations, I did not find it unreasonable for the Mother to cancel access after a fair grace period of 15 minutes had passed. It is implicit within the terms of access that the access parent must turn up on time. It would otherwise be unfair to the care parent and child to have to wait on tenterhooks for the Father to arrive at any moment, even hours after the appointed time, only to demand that the child appear within five minutes, with the obvious threat of committal should that time be exceeded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 3 – Occasions where the Child refused to attend </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     There were four occasions where the Father turned up for access but the Mother claimed that the Child refused to attend access. These were the dates of 16 April, 29 April, 13 May and 15 July 2023. The Mother submits that the Child refused to attend access due to preceding behaviour by the Father. Specifically:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With regard to 16 April 2023, the Mother explained that the child reacted to what had happened on the weekend of 8 April 2023, where the Father was rude to the child and claimed that the Mother’s residence was not the child’s home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to 29 April 2023, the Mother explained that the child was affected by the fact that the father was late and yet still sent a message that he would leave if the child is not coming out in five minutes. This was sent at 9:14 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to 13 May 2023, the Mother explained that the child was still angry over the Father’s behaviour in earlier incidents and got even angrier when the Father sent a message saying he would leave if the child was not coming out in five minutes. This was sent at 9:32 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     With regard to 15 July 2023, the Mother explained that the child was affected by the Father’s message, “If A is not out in 5 minutes or no reply, I’m leaving.” The Mother contends this affected the child and it was not possible to compel the child to see the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Father on the other hand submitted that there was no objective evidence that the child did not want to go out on those days, and neither was there evidence to show that the Mother had sufficiently encouraged him to attend. The Father also urged the court to note how the Mother had admitted to showing the child her text exchanges with the Father in the past, which the Father attributed to turning the child against him with regard to access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Having heard the Father’s argument, I found it curious that the Father’s reaction to any of these cancellations was not to choose to communicate with the child directly, to either persuade the child to attend, or at least to confirm the refusal on the part of the child. I note in this regard that neither the 2017 Order nor any other applicable order bars the Father from communicating directly with the child, and indeed, in interim directions I had given earlier in the committal proceedings, direct mobile communication was encouraged between the Father and child, with such communications having taken place in December 2022. The Father’s response in this regard was that the child had <em>likely</em> blocked him, citing an exchange with the Mother on 27 August 2023 where the Mother urged the Father to contact the child directly as the child had unblocked the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While I appreciate the Father’s frustration, I did not think it right to assume that the child had blocked him on the April to July incidents above. In any case, as the parent and the more mature party, it behoved him to at least try to establish communications with and check on the child’s intent. Without such attempt, the Father is unable to provide any proof, much less proof beyond the standard of reasonable doubt, that the Mother had undermined his access by alienating the son from him. I therefore gave the benefit of the doubt to the Mother and accepted her explanation that on these four occasions, she could not persuade her 13 year-old son to emerge from the house to attend access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 4 – Occasions where the Child did not attend for other reasons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     There were three further occasions where the child did not attend access for other reasons, which appear to me to essentially be misunderstandings borne out of miscommunication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the first such occasion on 19 March 2023, the Mother claimed that the child was down with fever after taking his Covid-19 booster injection. Notably, the 2017 Order had specified that there should be no cancellation of access even if the Mother had a medical certificate for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Mother’s submission in respect of this date is that there was no express cancellation of the access on that date, and the Father had simply assumed she was denying access and did not show up. Indeed, the only communication between parties pertaining to the 19 March access were as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(18 March 2023 at 8:51 pm) Tomorrow 9am I will be at the lift lobby to fetch A.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(19 March 2023 at 8:30 am) he took his booster and having fever</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Nothing further was said thereafter, and the Father did not turn up on that day. For this occasion, I accepted the Mother’s explanation that there was no expressed intent to cancel access on 19 March 2023. The Father had readily assumed that the Mother was cancelling access on medical grounds (presumedly based on previous negative experiences), and did not seek to clarify or at least turn up at the appointed time. I do not think this was warranted, especially since the 2017 Order had specifically stated that the Mother should not cancel access even if a medical certificate had been issued. Given that the Mother had only reported to him that the child had fever, I do not think the threshold of proof that the Mother had intended to cancel access was crossed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The second incident in this category occurred on 23 April 2023, when the Mother messaged the Father to inform him that she was celebrating Eid that weekend. While the 2017 Court Order gave the Mother right of access on Hari Raya public holidays, it was clarified that only a family celebration was contemplated on 23 April 2023, which was not the date of the public holiday itself, and was therefore not a reason to deny access. Again, the parties were very sparing in their communications and had only exchanged three short messages:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(22 April 2022 at 8:23 pm) I’ll be there tomorrow morning at 9am to fetch A</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">we are celebrating Eid</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tomorrow is not a public holiday nor Eid </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father did not turn up for access thereafter. Counsel for the Father argues that there was implicit cancellation of access by the Mother, since it was clearly understood by the parties that the Father would not be invited to join in the Mother’s celebrations for Eid. Again, I disagree that there was such implicit cancellation. The Mother did not expressly say she was going to cancel access. Her act of informing him of the Eid celebration may have been a precursor to negotiate for a swop of dates, which is encouraged in the spirit of co-parenting. The Father in this case should have clarified and gotten a clear response from the Mother that access was not proceeding, before simply writing off the access date as cancelled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On the third occasion, which fell on 27 May 2023, the Mother explained that access was not possible as the child had a school activity, which the Father would have been aware of through his access to the Parents’ Gateway.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(9:25 AM) If A is not out in 5 mins or no reply I am leave. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Again no show, I am leaving</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(12:40 pm) you already know he has school today and you purposely</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I didn’t know, you didn’t tell me nor did you let him come for the PTC face to face.

I nevertheless accepted that this arose out of a misunderstanding rather than an intent on the Mother’s part to deny the Father’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Taken together, the above three incidents were regrettable and would have been avoidable had there not been a colossal breakdown of communication between the Father and Mother. Such miscommunication creates the breeding ground for misunderstanding and unnecessary conflict. While I recognise that the enmity and animosity between the parents is deeply rooted in a decade of conflict, I do hope that parties realise that it is ultimately pragmatic to be polite, precise and clear in their communication, rather than resort to litigation to resolve their differences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 5 – Occasion where Father attended even though Mother had moved</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father had in the course of trial taken the position that the Mother was in breach of court orders for shifting from her place of residence from Canberra (in Sembawang) to Khatib (in Yishun). This was alleged by the Father to be a breach of the terms of joint custody. However, as this application concerned a lifting of the suspension of committal in relation to the breach of <em>access</em> orders, I did not consider the allegation to fall within the scope of the present application. Even if it did, I would venture to observe that as the Mother had care and control of the child, it was within her prerogative to relocate the child to another address locally, as long as this did not unreasonably fetter access in any way. I did not think the Mother’s change of address to constitute an issue of custody, unless the shift necessitated a change of school or had some other major impact on the child’s life. This was clearly not the case as the locations were fairly proximate to each other. Accordingly, I did not see the issue of the Mother’s move <em>per se</em> as constituting a breach of any access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The question then turns to whether the Father was informed in advance of the move, and if so, whether he was still entitled to insist on the exchange taking place at the lift lobby of the child’s former residence. The facts show that the Mother had shifted her residence on 25 August 2023 (Friday). She informed the Father of this on 26 August 2023 (Saturday) and asked him to meet the child at Khatib MRT for his access on 27 August 2023 (Sunday)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. However, the Father did not turn up at Khatib MRT at 9 am that day. Instead, he went to their original residence on 27 August 2023, expecting access to take place at that location.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I did not find this to be reasonable behaviour on the part of the Father. The spirit of the order stipulating an exchange at the lift lobby was intended to avoid earlier disputes on handover at the gate and at the ground floor of the block. While the Father need not have agreed to have the handover take place at Khatib MRT, the nearest approximation to satisfy the court order would have been the lift lobby of the new Yishun residence. Certainly, it would have made no sense to insist on a handover at the now defunct Canberra address. Accordingly, I found that the Mother had good reason not to hand over the child at the Canberra address, and her failure to do so at that location on 27 August 2023 should not be considered a breach of the access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For the reasons cited above, I did not make a finding of breach of access orders on any of the 25 occasions proceeded with by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I would observe though that had circumstances been different and some of the occasions amounted to breaches, I would still not have granted the draconian remedy of reversing care and control as requested by the Father. This would have been impracticable given that the Father has not cared for the child since 2020, and the state of the relationship was such that they could not even sustain a productive discussion on the final day of hearing with the assistance of a court family specialist. Ultimately, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration before the court, and it makes no sense to uproot the child from a familiar and supportive environment simply to punish the Mother for certain breaches.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In any case, this consideration is hypothetical, as I had observed a significant change in the Mother’s behaviour following the passage of the Committal Order. Having read her affidavit and heard her at trial, I was satisfied that she earnestly intended to produce the child for access and find a sustainable solution that would rid her of the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over her head for over a decade. Her protestations that she was unable to do so due to the child’s independent refusal to engage the Father were corroborated by the impression I had received during the Judge and Child session on 2 December 2022. Put simply, the child, then aged 12, had a mind of his own and was adamant in his views about his Father. I was satisfied over the material period in this Application that the Mother had tried her level best, at least more so than the Father, to resolve the impasse over access. Indeed, the Mother’s measured exchange of messages with the Father on 26 August 2023 from 8:43 am, urging the Father to communicate patiently with the child, are testament to her willingness to allow the Father to rebuild his relationship with the child and facilitate access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"24.56%\"><col width=\"75.44%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(Shows screenshot of conversation between the child and her, which states:</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother: I told him that he will msg you ok</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Child: but</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Child: I think I blocked him</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother: ok unblock him)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">make sure you establish a respectful polite conversation. he has unblocked you. start slow, not aggressive. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I have no interest I (sic)</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Your rubbish, he doesn’t come with me means no access.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I didn’t come to talk to my son, I came to fetch him</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">you need to start slow. why don’t we go for lunch together so he feels safe?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">you went to his school.

As earlier indicated in my brief grounds following the committal hearing, judicial commands alone cannot heal a broken bond between a parent and child. It takes patience and forbearance on the part of the parent seeking reconciliation to do so. This view finds support in a recent judgment of the High Court in <em>WOZ v WOY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 11</a>. Like the present case, that decision involved a father’s appeal against child orders which specified that access should take place at the ground floor lift lobby of the mother’s residence. The father in that case was unhappy that his 12-year old child would only stay with him for several minutes during the access, or was otherwise not responsive to him, choosing to do her homework quietly. Choo Han Teck J made the following observation that judicial commands alone would not rebuild the parent-child relationship, at [4]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The husband appealed because he desired a better outcome during his limited access time with the child. But the child is turning 12 this year, and she is thus at a sufficiently mature age to evaluate how a parent-child relationship should develop in their case. Relationship building requires time, effort, and patience from both sides. Above all, it is unique in each relationship. It is not amenable to judicial commands, and the courts must leave it to the parents to develop their own bond with their children, each in his or her own way. Sometimes, the court might offer a nudge here and there, but in the end, it must be left to the parent to find the formula.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Father understandably feels frustrated, hurt and humiliated by the rejection meted out by his son. Whilst compulsion is not necessarily the answer, I note that there is a fair sense of exhaustion with the therapeutic process as both parents and the child have undergone counselling and other supervised programmes under the then-Divorce Support Specialist Agencies, which have not succeeded in bridging the divide. However, I did think it would be useful for parties to attend before a specialist in reunification therapy under the Family Justice Courts’ Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme. Where other attempts had failed, a specialist with deep expertise in intractable cases of alienation may have a fighting chance of helping the father and child rebuild their relationship. The Mother gave her consent at the hearing to the child participating in this process, and the Father indicated his consent through counsel on 29 May 2024. It is my hope that parties make a bona fide and concerted attempt to achieve breakthrough in these sessions, and with patience, forbearance and forgiveness, finally normalise and restore relations between father and child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As I did not find the Mother to be in breach of the Committal Order or 2017 Order, the Father’s Application is dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Counsel for the Mother requested for costs of $6,000 (all-in), which included $1,000 for two oral applications made at the beginning of trial for which the Mother had prevailed. Counsel for the Father asks for no costs to be ordered, and noted that costs to the Father for an application for sub-service filed by the Father had been reserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I agreed with Counsel for the Mother that the cost for the Application alone should be $5,000, but I declined to award costs for the two oral applications, as no documents had been filed. I also considered that $1,000 in costs should be awarded to the Father for the application for sub-service. On a global basis, I therefore directed that costs of $4,000 (all-in) should be paid by the Father to the Mother.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence, Day 3 (19 March 2024), Page 44 at Lines 16 to 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See F1, at pages 18, 28, 37 and 38.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence, Day 2 (6 March 2024), Page 4, Line 5 to Page 6, Line 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>M1, at pages 24 to 36.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>F1, at page 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>M1, page 60.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>F1, at page 46.

There are now two adult children of the marriage namely, <b>B</b> (f) DOB XX June 1997 aged 26 years old (the daughter) and <b>C</b> (m) DOB XX September 2001 aged 22 years old (the son) at the time of the Ancillary Matters hearings but under 21 years of age at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It was submitted at the first Ancillary Matters hearing on 10 March 2023 that as the daughter was an adult, no orders were required to be made for her. However, it was also submitted at the same Ancillary Matters hearing, that the son still required maintenance as he had not yet completed his first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The marriage lasted about 25 years before the Father filed Writ of Divorce on 14 June 2021. Interim Judgement (IJ) was granted on an uncontested basis on 30 November 2021 based on the fact that the Father had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1 filed on 2 November 2021) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Parties to the marriage had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ and the Mother consented to a judgement being granted. The Ancillary Matters were adjourned to Chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       According to the Statement of Claim (SOC), there were 8 Ancillary Matters (AMs) to be decided by me. However, at the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, I noted that the IJ also contained two By Consent provisions regarding joint custody with care and control to the Mother and the Father’s liberal access, including overnight access, to the son as the son was still under 21 years old at the time the IJ was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Therefore, at the AMs hearings, Counsel addressed me on the remaining 6 AMs, which included maintenance for the son in Prayer 7(g) of the SOC under ‘Maintenance for the child of the marriage’. The 6 AMs were dealt with on three hearing dates by Zoom and I delivered my decision to Counsel by Registrar’s Notice (RN) on 27 October 2023 (the AMs Court Order) which included two (not three) ‘By Consent’ provisions on the son’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father then filed a Notice of Appeal (NOA) on 7 November 2023 against the whole of the AMs Court Order save for the Order that no maintenance was payable by the Father to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Following which, the Father also filed SUM 728/2024 on 6 March 2024, primarily seeking to set aside Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order on the ‘By Consent’ provisions. This was based on the case of <b><em>TOC v TOD <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck had held at paragraph 6 of the case that the recourse to any unhappy Party regarding Consent Orders was to apply to have the Consent Order set aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s Appeal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The crux of the Father’s appeal against Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son. This was the Father’s application in Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father has also appealed against my decision regarding Prayer 2 of his application in SUM 728/2024 relating to other Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As the crux of the Father’s appeal relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son, I will deal with this issue first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1 - Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     My orders regarding the maintenance to be paid by the Father for the son were set out in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of my Decision dated 27 October 2023 in the AMs Court Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In Prayer 1 of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, the Father had applied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 1</u>: that the 3 consent orders made by the Learned District Judge, Christine Lee on 27 October 2023 in FC/D 2823/2021 be set aside, namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall pay for the son’s namely, C (m) DOB XX September 2001 now aged 22 years old (“C”)’s education and living expenses until C has completed his first tertiary education in Canada. Such payments are to be arranged directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall also pay for C's return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the university breaks, to also be worked out directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    In addition, if the education and living expenses for C's first tertiary education in Canada exceeds the sum of S$200,000.00 which includes the payment to-date by the Plaintiff in the sum of S$100,667.34, the Plaintiff shall bear the difference until the completion of C's first tertiary education in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     With regard to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order: At the hearing on 15 May 2024, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the thrust of the Father’s application was that there was no consent by the Father to bear the son’s education and living expenses in Canada. There was also no consent from the Father that he would pay for the return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the son’s university breaks. It was submitted that the fault lay squarely on the Father’s previous Counsel<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s Counsel referred to page 258 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was a letter dated 30 October 2023 from the Father’s previous Counsel to the Court at 2 pages. It was submitted that this was written 3 days after my decision in the AMs Court Order, to support their submission that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the instructions or consent from the Father to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I noted that the said letter contained the Father’s previous Counsel’s queries on why I had only taken into account the sum of $99,332.66 as part of the Father’s liabilities in relation to the son’s university education fees and expenses and not the sum of $200,000.00. In response to my query on where it was stated in this letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that their position was that the very conduct of writing the letter was to corroborate the fact that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the Father’s instructions to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 261 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was their letter dated 13 December 2023 to the Father’s previous Counsel, stating in paragraph 2 therein that “<em>We are instructed by our client that he had at no time consented to the 3 orders</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father’s Counsel then referred to page 263 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply in 4 pages dated 20 December 2023. In response to my similar query on where it was stated in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s previous Counsel did not explicitly deny in this reply, that the Father did not consent to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. It was submitted that by not denying, this was equal to admitting<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and that in this letter, the Father’s previous Counsel was merely trying to justify that he had done a good job<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 268 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s reply by email dated 26 February 2024, to his previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, whereby the Father denied that he had consented to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Following which, I was informed that the Father’s previous Counsel then wrote to the Father’s Counsel to ask if he could communicate directly with the Father, to which they said no and there was no further communication with the Father’s previous Counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s Counsel then referred to paragraph 7 of his Written Submissions and submitted that the issue of who was going to pay for the son’s airfare was never stated in any of the Affidavits. I agreed that this issue was raised by me at the AMs hearing as shown at page 31 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit on the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) for the AMs hearings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel submitted that this issue was therefore based on the Father’s previous Counsel’s belief and not on his instructions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was also submitted that when I had raised this question, the Father’s previous Counsel did not ask to stand down the matter to seek the Father’s instructions before consenting to this, as was evident from the NE. It was further submitted that the Father was never told of the frequency of these flights, the costs and whether it would be at economy or other class. The Father’s Counsel submitted that there was no way the Father could have consented by a bare assertion that he would pay for the son’s airfare<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response to my query that it was stated in Clause 2 that the payment for such airfare was to be worked out directly between the Father and the son, the Father’s Counsel submitted that this should have been done before the AMs Court Order was made. The Father’s Counsel submitted that their point was that the Father’s previous Counsel should have checked with the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and that they would also address the separate point that the son should have applied for his own maintenance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother’s Counsel responded that for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order, he had dealt with the Father’s previous Counsel’s 30 October 2023 letter at page 5 of his Written Submissions in paragraph 10(v). The point made in that paragraph was that in the said letter, there was nothing said that the Father did not consent to these Clauses. It was noted that this letter was copied to the Father, so he was fully aware of this letter. The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father did not raise any objection to the letter, and he did not ask his previous Counsel why his previous Counsel did not tell the Court that he did not consent to these Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that in addition to this, when the Father’s previous Counsel replied on 20 December 2023, he did not explicitly deny that the Father had not consented to these Clauses. The Mother’s Counsel referred to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at pages 264/265 for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply of 20 December 2023 and highlighted that at paragraph 9 of the said letter, it was stated therein that there was an agreement that the sum of $200,000.00 should be deducted from the Father’s bank accounts for the son’s education and living expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that nowhere in that 20 December 2023 letter, did the Father’s previous Counsel say that he had acted ultra vires<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. It was further submitted that in paragraph 11 of the same letter, the Father’s previous Counsel explained why he had agreed to Clauses 1 and 2 being made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> and that it was never stated that this was done without the Father’s consent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother’s Counsel also referred to the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 in paragraph 8f at pages 3 &amp; 4 wherein the Father had stated that in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses as stated in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit. However, the Mother’s Counsel pointed out that in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit (his Supporting Affidavit), the Father did not state in that paragraph that his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Father’s Counsel responded that my decision was issued on 27 October 2023 and that immediately, there were emails sent by the Father to his previous Counsel which had not been exhibited because of client/Solicitor privilege. Therefore, it should not be assumed that there was no communication between them until the 20 December 2023 letter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel had nothing else to add.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     With regard to Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order: At the said hearing, I sought clarification from the Father’s Counsel that the Father’s basis for his application in SUM 728/2024 was that he did not consent to Clause 3. However, I pointed out that Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order was not a ‘By Consent clause’ but a Court ordered provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I referred the Father’s Counsel to page 35 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for the NE of the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023 whereby I had made it very clear that there was only two ‘By Consent’ provisions which were for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order only. Furthermore, Clause 3 was an “In addition” and not a ‘By Consent’ clause<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also referred the Father’s Counsel to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at page 36 for the NE of the same AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, from lines 23 to 31, whereby I had made it very clear that Clause 3 was not a ‘By Consent’ provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In response to my query on what was the Father’s basis for his application to set aside Clause 3, the Father’s Counsel sought confirmation that what I was saying was that the words “In addition” did not mean that it was also a ‘By Consent’ clause.

Under this Prayer, the Father had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 2:</u> Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s Counsel clarified at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that the Father’s application in Prayer 2 was for an order to be made that the son should make his own maintenance application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father’s Counsel referred to his Written Submissions at page 13 in paragraph 26 regarding the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0020.xml')\">[2014] SGCA 20</a></em></b>, specifically to paragraph 50 of the case wherein it was stated that since the son in that case had already attained 21 years of age, that the son should have personally made an application for maintenance and that the Wife in that case was not in a position to apply for the son’s maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In response to my query regarding paragraph 4 of the Father’s Counsel’s Written Submissions where Counsel had referred to the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 at paragraph 25 wherein the Father himself proposed to set aside the sum of $200,000.00 from the matrimonial pool for the son’s education, the Father’s Counsel’s response was that no one had pointed out to the Court at the time of the AMs hearings, that the son was already above 21 years old<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. This was not the case as I have explained below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father’s Counsel also submitted that paragraph 25 of the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit only referred to where this sum should come out from<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. It was also submitted that the Father was not saying that he would not pay for the son’s maintenance but that he should not solely pay for this as it was the joint responsibility of the Parents. It was also for the son to give evidence as to what his school fees and expenses were and not the Mother. The Father’s Counsel further submitted that the son was not a Party to the divorce proceedings, so this did not change the law on who should make the proper application, supported by Affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 was for the Consent Orders in the AMs Court Order to be set aside. The Father applied in Prayer 1 to set aside Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the AMs Court Order because these were not made By Consent. It was submitted that if the Court however, was of the view that these Clauses were made By Consent, then the matter should end there. Whether the AMs Court Order was appropriate or not, this would be dealt with in another forum. For the son’s maintenance, this Order was made under s.127 of the Women’s Charter, so there was nothing wrong with the Order that was made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father’s Counsel responded that with regard to s.127 of the Women’s Charter on child maintenance, under the Women’s Charter the child is defined as one below 21 years of age. It was submitted that although Clause 3 was not a Consent Order, the requirement that the son should apply for maintenance himself, should also be applicable to this Clause as only the son would know what his expenses were<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Reasons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     With regard to <u>Prayer 1</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 to set aside Clauses 1 and 2 being the two ‘By Consent’ Clauses in the AMs Court Order, I was guided by the cases on Consent Orders set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The first was the case of <b><em>Lee Min Jai v Chau Cheow Koon <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0548.xml')\">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 548</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck held that when considering privately settled terms as to the ancillary matters in divorce proceedings, what the Court had to be alert to, was that one Party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. A Court would interfere with an Order of Court obtained By Consent only on just and equitable grounds. Justice Choo also held that if the previous solicitor had failed in his duty, the Petitioner’s remedy would be against that solicitor and not the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I noted that both Parties were represented by Counsel and at no time did the Father’s previous Counsel indicate that he did not have the authority to agree to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ in the AMs Court Order. In fact, the consent of both Parties was clearly signalled to me when the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ were discussed. This was confirmed at several pages in the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Both Counsel confirmed and agreed that there could be consent provisions in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order as can be seen in the NE exhibited at pages 35 (lines 12 to 24) and page 36 (lines 13 to 21) of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The next case was <b><em>AEF v AEG <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0113.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 113</a></em></b> whereby, in dealing with the issue of Consent Orders, then Judicial Commissioner Lee Khim Shin noted that the Court of Appeal in <b><em>AOO v AON <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGCA 0051.xml')\">[2011] SGCA 51</a></em></b> had cited with approval, a passage which explains that not every failure of full and frank disclosure would justify a Court setting aside an Order. It would only be in cases where the absence of full and frank disclosure had led the Court to make an Order which was substantially different from the Order which it would have made if such disclosure had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, I noted that the Father had stated in the SOC that he was prepared to pay reasonable maintenance for the son. In addition, the Father had stated in paragraph 25 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>In this regard, I want to be fair to C. For the same way as I had paid for our daughter’s education, I believe that both the Defendant and I should use matrimonial assets to support C’s tertiary education. As such, I propose that from the cash portion of the pool of matrimonial assets, we set aside a sum of S$200,000.00 for C’s education….”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In my view, the above statement was confirmed in the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 for SUM 728/2024 in paragraph 6 wherein the Father had responded that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>The [Mother’s] assertion that I agreed to S$200,000.00 is incomplete because, I agreed to the sum of S$200,000.00 to be deducted from the common pool, which means the whole S$200,000.00 can be factored in as a liability under the [Father].</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As such, I would have come to the same decision regarding the Father’s payment in the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education. This was based on my assessment that the Father had agreed to pay for the son’s education and living expenses of the son’s first tertiary education, which was in Canada where the son was already studying at the time of the AMs hearings. I had also noted that it was not disputed at the time of the AMs hearings, that the Father was the sole breadwinner of the family and that the Mother had been a homemaker from the inception of the marriage until the Father commenced the divorce proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I was also of the view that based on the principles set out in the caselaw on By Consent Orders, there were no just and equitable grounds to set aside the two ‘By Consent Clauses’. On the contrary, to do so would be unjust and inequitable to both the son as well as the Mother, as the clauses on the son’s maintenance was one of my considerations in not awarding maintenance to the Mother. This was because I had taken into account the Father’s Fact and Position Sheet filed on 24 February 2023, wherein he had stated that <em>“The [Father] is prepared to pay for the Parties’ son’s university education. However, he humbly requests that this Honourable Court take it into consideration when it determines the division of matrimonial assets and whether maintenance should be awarded to the [Mother].”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Regarding Clause 2 of the AMs Court Order on the payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore, I was of the view that since it was not disputed that the son was already studying in Canada, there should be some provision for the son’s airfare to come home. In response to my query on this issue, the Father’s previous Counsel had informed that the Father was prepared to pay for any incidental expenses incurred for the son’s university education. In my view, it was logical that this should include payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore but, to be fair to the Father, that the specifics for this should be arranged directly between the Father and the son. This can be seen in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024 for the NE of the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 31 in lines 23 to 32, page 32 in lines 1 to 32, page 33 in lines 1 to 3, page 35 in lines 6 to 31 and page 36 in lines 1 to 22.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Finally, I was of the view that the Father’s claim that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ was an afterthought. I noted that all the documents provided by the Father at the hearing of SUM 728/2024 were made after the AMs Court Order was issued on 27 October 2023. The Father did not provide any document which was dated prior to the AMs Court Order, to show that he would not or could not have consented to these two ‘By Consent Clauses’. As such, I was of the view that the Father had failed to discharge the burden of proving that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ and that he was simply relying on assertions that were made after the AMs Court Order was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Regarding Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order, as I had made it very clear at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that this was not a ‘By Consent’ provision, I agree with the Father’s Counsel that Clause 3 should therefore remain the subject matter of the Father’s appeal. I would add that I had made the Orders for the Father to pay for the son’s first tertiary education and living expenses in Canada, on the basis of the Father’s own statements as referred to above, that he would pay the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     However, I did not agree with the Father’s conditions for the payment of the $200,000.00 by him. That was why I did not frame this Clause as a ‘By Consent’ provision. I was also of the view that it was reasonable to make an Order for the Father to bear the difference beyond the agreed sum of $200,000.00 until the completion of the son’s first tertiary education in Canada. This was to ensure that having commenced his first tertiary education in Canada, the son would have the stability of knowing that he would be able to complete his studies. My assessment was that it was within the Father’s financial capacity to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     With regard to <u>Prayer 2</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, I noted that in the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee</em></b>, the son in that case was already over 21 years at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed but in the present case, the son was still 20 years old at the time the Father filed the Writ of Divorce. I also noted that in the SOC filed by the Father, he himself had included the Prayer that he would pay reasonable maintenance for the son. I further noted that when IJ was granted in November 2021, the son was still under 21 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I was aware that the son was over 21 years old at the time of the AMs hearings. In fact, this was noted in paragraph 4 of my Brief Reasons and stated in Clause 1 itself of the AMs Court Order. At the AMs hearings, it was submitted that the Father was agreeable to pay and had continued to pay as maintenance for the son, while the son pursued his first tertiary education in Canada. This can be seen in lines 3 to 26 of the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 25 in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Hence, I was of the view that where both Parents had agreed that the son’s maintenance could be included in the AMs Court Order even though the son was already over 21 years at the time, that this was reasonable and in the best interests of the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I had decided against making an Order under Prayer 2 of SUM 728/2024 that the son should make his own maintenance application, because the law already allows the son to make his own maintenance application from the Father. Therefore, there was no necessity for me to make such an Order as this would appear to be compelling the son to make a maintenance application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I was of the view that even if the Father succeeds in setting aside the ‘By Consent Clauses’ of the AMs Court Order, it is still the son’s choice whether or not the son wishes to make a maintenance application from the Father. As such, I declined to make any Order which would appear to compel the son to make such an application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Accordingly, I delivered my Decision and Brief Reasons orally to Counsel on 15 May 2024 on the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024. I have nothing further to add to my reasons given above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Notes of

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Defendant Husband in this case sought a stay of Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, in favour of Malaysian proceedings commenced by himself. In response, the Plaintiff Wife filed an anti-suit injunction in SUM 56/2024 to injunct the Husband’s divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I held that while Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the divorce proceedings, the threshold to injunct the Malaysian proceedings had not been crossed. I therefore dismissed both applications. The Husband now appeals against my refusal to grant his stay in SUM 3790/2023. For completeness, and due to the common context between both applications, I provide my reasons for both decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both parties are Malaysian citizens. The Husband and Wife were aged 55 years and 41 years at the time of these proceedings. The couple married in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2001, and resided together in Malaysia for the next three years. They moved to Australia in 2004 to 2008, where three children were born to the marriage, a daughter aged 19 years (“A”), and a pair of male and female twins aged 17 years (“I” and “V” respectively). After the birth of the twins, the family moved back to Malaysia in 2008, and then to Singapore within that same year for the sake of the children’s education. In April 2011, the Husband left the family in Singapore and returned to Malaysia by himself to pursue his business interests. He has been based in Malaysia ever since. The Wife is currently employed in Singapore and holds an employment pass. All three children remain Malaysian citizens, although the eldest child (A) obtained Singapore citizenship in September 2022, and the female twin (V) obtained permanent residency in Singapore in February 2021. It is not disputed that the parties’ extended family resides in Malaysia and frequent family trips are taken back home to Malaysia. However, the family as a whole and the children in particular have never resided in Malaysia for any meaningful period of time since 2008.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced these divorce proceedings on 1 August 2023. The Husband has not taken any step in these divorce proceedings since being served on 16 October 2023, save to enter appearance under protest and indicate his intention to stay the action on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. At a case conference on 16 November 2023, the Husband was directed to file his application for a stay by 7 December 2023. The Husband then commenced divorce proceedings in Malaysian on 7 December 2023, and shortly after, filed his application for a stay of the Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on 12 December 2023. The Malaysian divorce proceedings were subsequently served on the Wife on 26 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of this hearing, apart from filing for an anti-suit injunction, the Wife had also applied in Malaysia to set aside the order of service out of jurisdiction obtained by the Husband. She had also sought a stay of the Malaysian proceedings on the basis that it was not a proper forum for the dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The matter came before me for hearing on 19 April 2024. As the Father had not had access to the children and the Wife had not received maintenance since proceedings commenced, I asked parties to consider an adjournment for three sessions of private mediation, which could also afford the Father access to the children over a meal on the days that each mediation session would be held. The Father in addition volunteered to pay $15,000 directly to the children for maintenance when he saw them for access. As parties were agreeable to this proposal, I gave the necessary directions and adjourned the matter for further hearing on 3 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Unfortunately, the mediation did not bear fruit, although the Father did manage to have one session of access with the children to celebrate their birthdays. I accordingly heard the remainder of parties’ submissions on 3 June 2024, and issued my decision on both applications with brief grounds by way of Registry Notice on 11 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The law relating to a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is well documented. The test laid down in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) has been affirmed in numerous local cases, including by our Court of Appeal in <em>CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> at [25] and [26]. The two-stage test is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden is on the defendant to show that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes at this stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate, it will ordinarily refuse a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there is some other available forum which <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of such special circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysia is the more appropriate forum </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Nationality and Habitual Residency of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Both parties were born in Malaysia and have Malaysian citizenship. Neither party is a Singapore citizen or Permanent Resident. The Husband has been domiciled in Malaysia upon his return in 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife and the children have been domiciled in Singapore for 16 years, since 2008. The eldest child (A) has Singapore citizenship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, while the female twin (V) has permanent residency<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although all three children have not given up their Malaysian citizenship. It is undisputed that the Wife and children visit Malaysia regularly to spend time with their relatives<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, I would point out that nationality alone is not the determinative factor in the choice of forum. The focus should instead be on the domicile or habitual residence of the parties. This was highlighted by the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a>, at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>While not entirely discounting nationality as a connecting factor, nationality per se is of limited significance. In an increasingly globalised world, multiple nationalities are becoming the norm. Residency and/or domicile are better indicators of then strength of a party’s connection to a particular forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Counsel for the Husband sought to rely on <em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, a decision of the Family Division of the High Court of England, to justify a stay in favour of the preceding place of domicile of the parties (i.e. Malaysia). In the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, the husband sought a stay of proceedings in the United Kingdom in favour of New York. While both parties were not citizens of either jurisdiction, they had originally resided in New York for a significant period of time prior to the marriage, and had thereafter lived in the United Kingdom for 13 years during the marriage. In particular, the husband had resided in New York for over 20 years and ran his “enormous financial empire” primarily from that location<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Counsel for the Husband therefore sought to draw a parallel between <em>S. v S.</em> and the present case, as the English High Court in <em>S. v S.</em> had agreed to stay English proceedings in favour of New York, which was the domicile of both parties <em>prior</em> to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There was however a clear distinguishing factor in the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, as the parties had executed a pre-nuptial agreement in New York, which provided that the applicable law and forum for any financial dispute should be that of the state of New York. The primacy of this factor over that of the domicile of the parties was clear from the final comments Wilson J’s decision, at page 1215:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the end I have been persuaded that New York is clearly more appropriate than England as a forum for the proceedings for divorce and for the determination of financial issues between the parties. In reaching that conclusion I have borne very much in mind the wife’s primary residence in England; nor, however, have I forgotten her close past links with New York. I have obviously paid considerable regard to the husband’s primary residence, established over many years, in New York. <u>But the provisions of the prenuptial agreement, both the substantive financial provisions and in particular the provisions as to forum, have weighted heavily with me</u>. Even if, which I doubt, this agreement were to be of very limited significance in any substantive analysis by this court of the wife’s financial claims pursuant to section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, it in no way follows that it must be of very limited significance in the despatch of the current application. Fairness requires otherwise. I am also satisfied, for the reasons already given, that substantial justice will be done in New York. Accordingly, the balance of fairness is such that it is appropriate for the proceedings there to be disposed of before further steps are taken in the proceedings here. This conclusion yields me a discretion which I propose to exercise by granting a stay. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Accordingly, I did not agree that the preceding domicile or place of origin of the parties should be the determinative factor as far as the <em>Spiliada</em> test was concerned. In the present case, the focus should be on the <em>present</em> domicile of the parties and the children. Out of 22 years of marriage, the parties have only spent three years in Malaysia as a married couple (from 2001-2004). The Wife has a stronger and more substantial connection to Singapore, having resided here for 16 out of the 23 years of marriage, while the Husband has resided in Malaysia for about 16 years for the duration of the marriage (2001-2004, and 2011-present). The children have also stayed in Singapore for most of their lives. They were born in Australia, and moved to Singapore when they were 3 years and 1 year old respectively. They have been educated here, with their entire social circle found in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. They also have family and cousins in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. As earlier noted, the eldest child (A) has taken up concurrent Singapore nationality, while the female twin (V) is a permanent resident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband further takes the position that parties remain connected to Malaysia and the intention is for the entire family to eventually return to Malaysia after the children complete their education in Singapore, with a view to them taking over the family business<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. I would point out though that the Husband had in the Malaysian court papers asked for the children to stay in Singapore with the Wife after the resolution of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, and there does not appear to be any agreement from the Wife or the children to his long-term plan to return to Malaysia. I also note that the Wife has unsuccessfully applied for permanent residency in Singapore seven times, and her sister and family are also permanent residents and reside in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. I did not think it evident at all that the Wife’s future intentions lay with Malaysia, and in any case, I would not place any significant weight on this point given its speculative nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     With regard to residency, there appears therefore to be an even split in terms of the habitual residency of the Husband and Wife in favour of Malaysia and Singapore respectively, while the residency of the children indisputably lies with Singapore. Whether this latter factor should be given determinative weight in the choice of forum depends on whether child issues will come to the fore in these proceedings. I now turn to this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Child Issues in the Divorce</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In applying the <em>Spiliada</em> test to divorce proceedings, the key question for determination by the court is which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the children (per <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [15]). This view was earlier established in <em>Re A</em> (an infant) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4206-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 60</a>, where Lai Kew Chai J held at [4] that the evaluation of the best interests of the child would require a consideration of which forum could best appreciate their cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances in their upbringing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of the guardianship of a child, and the related issues of custody, care and control, it seemed to me that we had to take into account a host of factors and determine which forum would more effectively evaluate the best interests of the child, in terms of a tribunal’s understanding of and affinity to the cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances relevant to the best way in which the child is to be brought up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     His Honour went on to hold, at [16], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of these proceedings involving the custody of a child, an important consideration must be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum serves. This is self-evident: a child’s best interest is best determined by the forum which is best equipped to determine what is best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Indeed, where custody, care and control are disputed in the divorce, a key factor on which forum is more appropriate is where the children had been raised. In <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, the fact that the children of the marriage were raised in Singapore was a key factor rejecting the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of California (at [20], [21]). Similarly, in <em>TAR v TAS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17691-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 23</a>, the court placed significant weight on the fact that the child of the marriage had lived and been educated in Singapore for the majority of her years. The court then rejected the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of the Nigerian courts, where the child had never resided (at [24],[25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In response, Counsel for the Husband contends that the issues in this divorce pertain mainly to financial matters, and that issues in relation to the children are not likely to be disputed. While I would like to share counsel’s optimism, I note that the Father is asking for care and control of the children in the Malaysian proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife is requesting for care and control in the Singapore proceedings (the Father had not filed pleadings in the Singapore proceedings at the time of this hearing, but in his recently filed Defence and Counterclaim on 11 July 2024, he now requests for <em>joint</em> custody, care and control, which still differs from the Wife’s position). I also note that the parties have not been able to agree on access in recent months. This does not augur well for agreement on child issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In addition, the Husband had stopped paying maintenance since November 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, and it appears that the quantum of child maintenance is likely to be disputed. In this regard, it cannot be assumed that evidence in relation to the children’s welfare, education and upkeep will not be necessary. Nor can it be ruled out that therapeutic and/or forensic interventions may be needed to protect the children’s best interests. I therefore consider that the potential need to litigate on children issues points strongly towards Singapore as the more appropriate and natural forum for the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In the present case, there is also the additional consideration that two of the children have special medical needs requiring long term medical care. Specifically, the eldest child (A) is diagnosed as being autistic and also suffers from Hereditary Angioedema<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, while the male twin (I) suffers from dyslexia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As both children will continue to receive treatment and therapy in Singapore, the cost and nature of which is likely to feature in considerations relating to maintenance, this once more points towards Singapore as the more natural and appropriate forum for resolution of child-related issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Location of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The third factor the Husband submits for consideration is the fact that there are substantial assets in the matrimonial pool located in Malaysia, which would be better dealt with by the Malaysian courts. He points out that the matrimonial assets there include shares in the Husband’s Malaysian Company, as well as two properties in the state of Johor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. He is also a director of ten other companies incorporated in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, the records of which are held in Malaysia and in the Malay language, with the requisite witnesses in Malaysia. Counsel for the Husband seeks to rely on the case of <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 2 SLR(R) 0851.xml')\">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851</a>, where it was held at [34] by the Court of Appeal that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the nationality and place of residence of the parties are relevant, they are not the only factors to be taken into account in deciding whether Singapore is the appropriate forum. The jurisdiction of the court is not based on nationality and residence of the parties alone. Great weight should also be attached to the location of the subject matters in dispute and the undesirability of a Singapore court in deciding issues involving ownership of land in Malaysia. In addition, there may be complexities involved in the enforcement of the trust in Malaysia, should we declare there to be one. In any event, the respondent would be carrying on with the proceedings in Malaysia in relation to the Malaysian lands even if we refuse to grant a stay of proceedings in Singapore and there would inevitably be some duplication of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While the existence of Malaysian assets is a factor in favour of granting a stay, it should be remembered that there are three properties in the Wife’s name in Singapore, for which the Malaysian Court would be similarly ill-equipped to make findings of fact or to enforce orders. There also exist assets in Australia, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Papua New Guinea and Switzerland<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, for which both the Singapore and Malaysian courts are equally well placed to deal with their division. Accordingly, I did not think that either court had a special advantage as far as financial assets are concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Existence of Parallel Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Finally, the Husband submits that greater weight should be placed in favour of Malaysia under the common law doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, i.e. the fact that he has filed parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I note in this regard that the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGCA 50</a>, at [39] had clarified that this doctrine should be considered in light of the general principles applicable to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. In essence, the court should consider the degree to which respective proceedings had advanced, the degree of overlap of issues and parties, whether the litigation called for complex facts which require highly specialised expert evidence and the risk of conflicting judgments arising from conflicting proceedings. The Court of Appeal stressed at [40] that “the existence of parallel proceedings is never wholly dispositive of the issue of the natural forum as a matter of course, but is only a factor to be considered in the application of the <em>Spiliada</em> principles.” It was further noted by then-Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong in <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [57] that “the weight to be given to parallel proceedings would depend on the circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As divorce applications in Singapore and Malaysia are in their infancy, I did not think that the doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> was a significant factor in the present case. Indeed, both applications had not advanced beyond the pleadings stage at the time of this hearing. The risk of duplicitous outcomes or wasted proceedings is remote at this point, and can be avoided should sensible minds prevail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Moreover, I do note that any issue arising from the duplicity of proceedings appears to have been self-inflicted, as it was the Husband who chose to commence divorce proceedings in Malaysia nearly two months <em>after</em> the Singapore proceedings had been served on him. In <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a>, Choo J noted at [11] in regard to the husband’s appeal against an anti-suit injunction restraining him from continuing with New York proceedings, that “it does not lie in the mouth of the husband to rely on the rule against duplicitous proceedings having commenced the action in New York himself.” In this regard, the Wife further contends that there does not appear to be a justifiable rationale for the Husband to continue with the Malaysian proceedings, given that she had on 5 January 2024 provided him a written undertaking that she would consent to judgment in the Malaysian Courts on terms identical to the terms of the final judgment in the Singapore proceedings, if the Husband agreed to suspend the Malaysian proceedings until after the conclusion of the Singapore proceedings. While I will address this issue more fully in the anti-suit injunction below, it would suffice to say for the purposes of the stay application that the infancy of the foreign proceedings and the fact that they are within the control of the applicant undermine his argument that it should be the Singapore courts that should desist to avoid a duplicity of outcomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Having considered the above factors in totality, I placed greater weight on the domicile of the Wife and children, and the need to protect the best interests of the children, as reasons to conclude under the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that Singapore was the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether there are circumstances which would have required a stay to be refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As there was no finding of another more appropriate forum, it was not necessary to address the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test. However, I would observe for completeness that <em>had</em> the factors justified a stay in favour of Malaysian proceedings, there did not seem to me to be any special circumstances that would have militated against such a stay. I note that the Wife is fluent in the Malay language, is presently able to instruct Malaysian counsel, and appears to have the resources to contest divorce proceedings in Malaysia. Accordingly, had the Husband passed the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test before me, he would not have fallen short at its second stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Anti-Suit Injunction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I also set out the reasons for my dismissal of the Wife’s anti-suit injunction in FC/SUM 56/2024. Although the Wife has not appealed against my order, the issues discussed in these part of the proceedings may provide further context to the application for the stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The legal principles relevant to an anti-suit injunction are set out in the landmark decision of the Privy Council in <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68454-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 871</a> (“Aerospatiale”) at page 892, as well as the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the court decides to grant an anti-suit injunction, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     An injunction will only be issued to restrain a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court, against whom an injunction will be an effective remedy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction depends on the presence of several elements, which were spelt out by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a> (“<em>AQN</em>”) at [44], having taking reference from <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham v Trane US Inc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     whether the foreign proceedings are <em>prima facie</em> vexatious or oppressive (or otherwise unconscionable);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the defendant any injustice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is not disputed that the Husband is amenable to the jurisdiction of this court (factor (a)), and my decision above on <em>forum non conveniens</em> finds that Singapore is the natural forum for this divorce (which resolves factor (b)). There is also no issue of any agreement between the parties on choice of jurisdiction (factor (e)). The crux of this application therefore lies with two of the above factors: the question of whether foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive (factor (c)), and whether the grant of the injunction would cause the Husband any injustice (factor (d)). I shall deal with each in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I turn first to the issue of vexation or oppression. In <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>, the Court of Appeal highlighted the factors to be considered in deciding whether the threshold for vexation or oppression had been met, at [44]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether there has been vexatious conduct involves an assessment and evaluation of a number of factors. The list of factors is not closed. The <u>inherent weakness of a claim</u> sought to be pursued in the foreign proceedings when taken together with other factors may be a relevant factor in considering whether the foreign proceedings are vexatious (see <em>VKC</em> at [19]). Factual findings which have supported findings of vexation or oppression include where the foreign proceedings were instituted in <u>bad faith or for no good reason</u>, are <u>bound to fail</u>, will <u>cause extreme inconvenience</u> (see the decision of this court in <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a> (“<em>Kirkham</em>”) at [47]), <u>amount to an unlawful attack on the plaintiff’s legal rights</u> (see the High Court decision of <em>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 2 SLR(R) 0457.xml')\">[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457</a> at [46]–[64]), or are <u>duplicative of Singapore proceedings</u> (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [112]–[129]). In so far as this last category is concerned, however, there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em> – something additional is required to make the duplication vexatious. For example, the greater the positive and voluntary involvement of the injunction respondent in the local proceedings, and the longer the local suit has been allowed to proceed before the commencement of the parallel foreign proceedings, the stronger the case for an injunction (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [137] as well as Thomas Raphael, <em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em>”) at paras 19.43–19.44). [<b>Emphasis added</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the present case, there is no indication that the case is bound to fail on the merits. The parties and their children are Malaysian citizens, and the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia. He is fully within his rights to file for divorce in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The principal contention by Counsel for the Wife is that the Malaysian proceedings were instituted in bad faith, given its timing and particular circumstances. In the present case, the Husband had initially filed for judicial separation on 31 October 2023, which he withdrew and substituted with a petition for divorce on 7 December 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Wife suggests that this change of position was not <em>bona fide</em> and was undertaken simply to bolster an application to stay the Singapore proceedings, given that the Malaysian proceedings were filed on the same day as the deadline for the filing of the stay application. The Wife also argues that the Husband’s ground of adultery in the Malaysian proceedings cannot be a serious one. She points out that it was filed more than five months after he was aware of the alleged facts of adultery on 27 June 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, and is inconsistent with an offer he made on 29 June 2023, just two days after learning about the alleged adultery, to register a new company in the Wife’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to the timing of the filings, Counsel for the Wife refers to <em>Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23402-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGCA 42</a> (“<em>Lakshmi</em>”) for support. The foreign proceeding in this case was filed almost three years after the respondent had the right to proceed, and some 20 months after the Singapore proceeding had been filed (see [89]-[90]). In addition, the foreign proceeding was commenced just one day after the respondent had received news that the Singapore suit would be proceeding (at [92]). The Court of Appeal saw this as evidence of bad faith on the part of the respondent (at [93]). Counsel’s view is that the present case is synonymous with the facts of <em>Lakshmi</em>, and should likewise merit an injunction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was however not persuaded that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing were sufficient to raise a finding of bad faith. Divorce is a personal matter, and parties may choose to file for their own reasons and at the timing of their choice, sometimes long after the fact. The Wife’s own divorce application on the basis of unreasonable behaviour relies on facts that go back to the couple’s teenage years. Indeed, in this case, the Husband was served with the Wife’s divorce papers on 16 October 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, and shortly after proceeded to file for judicial separation on 31 October 2023 (i.e. still choosing to preserve the marriage). He explained that he had thereafter reached out to the Wife, but she had declined further communication and displayed no intention of engaging in discussions relating to the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. According to the Husband, he only filed the Malaysian divorce petition on 7 December 2023 when he perceived that the Wife was determined to proceed with the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I found this to be a reasonable account for his change in position, and did not perceive that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing necessarily speaks to bad faith on his part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Counsel for the Wife also points out that there was no legitimate reason to commence duplicative divorce proceedings in Malaysia, when the Husband could simply have filed a counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings. While the Husband had explained that he had done so because the children were Malaysian citizens, Counsel for the Wife pointed out that he was already aware that the eldest child had been offered Singaporean citizenship and it was a “matter of time” she would accept<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Counsel also made reference to <em>Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21016-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 814</a> at [67], pointing out that the Court of Appeal in that case had rejected the relevance of foreign proceedings which were filed after the Singapore actions and which were no more than the converse of what the other party was seeking in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     This does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that all duplicitous proceedings deserve to be injuncted. I note that the Court of Appeal said in <em>VEW v VEV</em> (at [44]) that “there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em>”. Unlike in <em>Lakshmi</em>, where there were no strong connecting factors to the foreign proceedings filed in the British Virgin Islands, the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia with business interests there. It would be legitimate for him to exercise his preference to litigate in the legal system with which he is familiar. His decision to file fresh proceedings in Malaysia rather than challenge the Singapore proceedings by way of counterclaim cannot on its own be regarded as vexatious or oppressive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Finally, the Wife seeks to prove bad faith on the basis that the Malaysian proceedings are intended to cause extreme inconvenience to her. She couples this argument with the fact that the Husband had ceased paying maintenance from 1 November 2023, which she claims was intended to starve her of financial resources and prevent her from proceeding with the divorce. The Wife points to the asymmetry of resources between the parties, claiming that the Father is wealthy while she is unemployed and cash-poor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In support of this contention, Counsel for the Wife sought to rely on the following observation by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN</em> at [27]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, I find that the foreign proceedings are vexatious and oppressive, and an anti-suit injunction should be granted to meet the ends of justice. The wife has not been receiving maintenance from the husband. Her financial resources are strained, having to deal with the numerous applications filed by her husband both locally and in New York. The husband, who is wealthy on the other hand, has the resources to litigate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I was not persuaded by this argument. It is not disputed that apart from the matrimonial home (in which she resides rent-free), the Wife has two other properties in Singapore on which she can rely for passive income. While there has been a threat of legal proceedings to prevent the Wife from doing so, it is not disputed that she can exercise rights as a legal owner of the properties. Further, it is also open to the Wife to file for interim maintenance in Singapore if she was under financial pressure. The pending application for a stay would not have prevented her from doing so. The fact that she has not done so is telling, and undermines her attempt to demonstrate that she has been financially oppressed by the multiplicity of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In this vein, I would point out that the fact that multiple proceedings require the expense of time and money does not of itself render the situation vexatious or oppressive. This was the observation of the court in <em>VEW v VEV</em> at [101]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, the respondent’s counsel submits that there would be “time, effort and expense” incurred in the English proceedings. While that is true, this does not in itself show that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious or oppressive, or that the appellant is using the Part III proceedings to exert improper pressure on the respondent...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I would also take care to point out that the factual matrix in the present case differs quite significantly from <em>AQN v AQO</em>, where the anti-suit injunction was granted on the basis that the New York proceedings had left the wife financially strained. In that case, proceedings in both Singapore and New York had commenced for about four years before the anti-suit injunction was heard. The New York proceedings had gone through multiple hearings at the Supreme Court of New York from 2011 to 2013, the decision of which was under appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. Considerable time and expense that had thus been incurred due to a multiplicity of proceedings for four years in <em>AQN v AQO</em>. This is not the case on the present facts. Given the proximity of the jurisdictions and the parties’ resources at hand, and the fact that proceedings are in their infancy in both jurisdictions, it cannot be said that the multiplicity of proceedings would prejudice the wife’s ability to advance her case in either jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the Defendant any injustice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I turn next to the question of whether the grant of an injunction would be unjust to the Husband (factor (d)). The Husband submits that he would suffer a juridical advantage if the divorce and ancillary matters were heard in Singapore, as he would lose the chance to have all ancillary matters heard together with the divorce petition in Malaysia. He claims that the Malaysian process would be more expedited and efficient than the extended legal process in Singapore, which bifurcates the interim judgment for divorce from the hearing on ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I find it difficult to agree with this submission because there is no affidavit evidence on the steps required in Malaysian divorce proceedings, nor is there any proof that one legal system is in any way more expeditious or efficient than the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I did consider that in terms of enforcement, the Husband may face practical difficulty enforcing an order given by the Singapore court in his favour. However, I note the Wife has given an undertaking that any order made by a court in Singapore would be mirrored by consent in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Accordingly, did not find that any juridical disadvantage accrues to the Husband in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction against the Husband </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The starting point in an anti-suit injunction is quite different from that of a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In deciding whether to apply the invasive step of granting an <em>in personam</em> injunction against one party from proceeding in a foreign jurisdiction, the court must exercise great caution that the ends of justice do indeed merit such a serious imposition on the prerogative of a person to vindicate his or her legal rights in the manner and place as deemed fit. It is also a matter of comity between courts of competent jurisdiction that this draconian remedy should be exercised only when it is patently clear to all that the interest of justice requires one court to essentially deny the other of its right to exercise its jurisdiction. In the present case, while a multiplicity of proceedings is clearly undesirable, it is for the Wife to persuade the Malaysian court to grant a stay on the basis that Singapore is the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of divorce proceedings. I do not find the factors tipped so far in the Wife’s favour that the Husband should be injuncted from proceeding further in the Malaysian courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having considered the reasons provided above, the following directions were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s application for a stay on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in SUM 3790/2023 was dismissed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s application for an anti-suit injunction in relation to the Husband’s Malaysian proceedings in SUM 56/2024 was dismissed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As parties have each prevailed in one application and failed in the other, no order was given as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [27] and [40].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [59].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [75] and [76].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, at page 1204.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [68].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [101].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [47] and [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [70] and page 147.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at page 202-203.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, Volume 1, at page 121.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [16].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [55] and [56].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [39].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [99], at [99].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at pages 130-131.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [108].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 74.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 61.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>See 1PBOD, at page 429.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 2nd Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [5].</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of consent order – Custody, care and control of child – Child maintenance"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1182 of 2022","title":"XBA v XBB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 62","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32019-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chew Wei En (Teoh & Co) for the Plaintiff","Defendant-in-Person"],"timestamp":"2024-08-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XBA v XBB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBA <em>v</em> XBB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 62</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

He also sought that the child be returned home by 9 p.m. should either party bring the child out of the home and that “no romantic third parties (be) present during each party’s care period”. <em>I allowed the request to the extent that the child could be with his father every Wednesday after kindergarten ends to 8 p.m. on Fridays.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the maintenance for the child be reduced to $500 per month from $2 000 per month with educational expenses being paid by the ex-husband solely and directly to the kindergarten/childcare centre. <em>This was dismissed save that I had ordered the ex-wife to produce proof of kindergarten, childcare, tuition fees and medical cost before payment is made.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the ability of the ex-wife to remain at the home be until such time she remarries. <em>By the time the matter came before the court however, the ex-wife had already left the home with the child making this request for her to move out redundant.</em> She had also confirmed that she had registered her marriage with her new partner in May 2024. A child from this union was due to be delivered when parties came for the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the child attend counselling. <em>I made no order on this as there was an absence of any indication of the nature of counselling that was sought, why it was sought for the child alone and where or who was to provide this. Instead, I directed the engagement of the court’s counselling and psychological services unit to provide more information to the parties.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_f\"></a>(f)     the passport of the child be returned to the ex-husband by the ex-wife and that she is not to travel with the child without the ex-husband’ consent. <em>This was dismissed.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Against these orders, the ex-husband appeals. He also appeals on my order that each party was to bear his or her own costs for the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Varying Consent Orders</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The courts have been slow to vary consent orders. In family matters, the need for members of a family to progress beyond the grief arising from the breakdown of a family is assisted by the process of mediation which if successful, allows parties to own and therefore be empowered by the agreements that they reach. To unravel this would be to revisit the grief that they are encouraged to move from. There is also the potential for abuse if requests are made soon after mediated settlements especially if it were for the simple reason that one party feels that he no longer wants to abide by its terms. When it involves care arrangements and financial support for children, patience must be exercised, and sufficient time must be taken by the parties to allow the agreement to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (1961) provides for the ability of a parent to seek variation of a custody and/or care and control order if there was any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or a material change in circumstances. In <b><em>DDN</em></b> v <b><em>DDO</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Appellate Division stated that while a court would take a holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues relating to the welfare of a child, this should not encourage parties to pursue variation of orders at the earliest opportunity. The parents are to do their best in to successfully implement the ordered arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Similarly, an order for the maintenance of children made pursuant to s 127 of the Charter can be varied if there are material changes in circumstances or for any other good cause, the latter allowing a court a wide approach to variation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> When a paying party meets with a situation that significantly impacts his ability to pay, for example the loss of employment or a serious health concern, variation is typically allowed. Much too often however even the smallest of change in the expenses of a child sees a parent applying for variation in these courts. A child’s expenses will change, sometimes even within the month orders are made. Parents should pause and consider aspects such as the cost of living, the need to provide for ad hoc or unexpected expenses before applying for variation and understand that in certain months, not all of the maintenance is used up and in certain others, more is needed. The agreed amount should continue to be paid with such an awareness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Joint custody of the child – should there be variation?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The need to co-parent, sometimes even in the most volatile of relationships between former spouses has been extensively written on. The roots of co-parenting are respect for the needs of a child, a child who is born from the union of 2 people and who therefore deserves the involvement of each parent. Parenting does not end on the termination of a marriage. In fact, it should continue even stronger, freed from the tension and anxiety between parents caught in circumstances that they did not hope for at the inception of the marriage. Yet, continuing disagreement between parents even over the smallest of things make co-parenting appear theoretically sound but sometimes, a practical nightmare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the matter before me, the ex-husband did not seek a change to the joint custody arrangement that was agreed to but asked that he be given the sole decision-making ability when it came to the educational and medical needs of his son should the parties not be able to agree on issues arising in these areas. In cases where parties are not working well together, there is a real possibility that the interests of the child are compromised as a result. At the same time, allowing one parent to make all decisions relating to the education and health concerns of a child where parties cannot agree is often a licence given to that parent to point quickly to the slightest disagreement as basis for unilateral decision-making. I saw no need to change the order given that it was entered into only in January 2023 and parties have yet to begin to work together on these issues. There is certainly an issue with communication but in my view, the challenges were not being posed by the ex-wife alone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The child is in his second and final year of kindergarten. The ex-husband was concerned that his child was developing slower than his peers and accused the mother of not taking steps to better prepare the child for primary school, especially for Mandarin. He also alleged that she failed to attend at an organisation that was recommended to them by the child’s school for assessment to be conducted in order to ascertain if there were any needs which requires medical intervention. He wanted the child to move to another childcare centre he believed would support his child’s needs better.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife showed to the court another report from the school which presented a different and more positive picture. I could not place weight on that as it was unsigned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>The mother however had also taken the child for assessment at a local children’s hospital and the child was continuing with speech therapy at the hospital. She informed that the child was progressing well. She had also arranged for tuition classes so that he could be better prepared for primary school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> While these steps appear to be taken late in the day suggesting that she had wanted to advance her cause in these proceedings, there was no suggestion that she was negligent or that she would cease all assistance after proceedings. She spoke through an Interpreter during the hearing as she was in person. There was a genuine expression of concern for her son. What appears to be standing between parties is a different set of expectations on what a 6-year-old child should be exposed to as he prepares for primary school. She also claimed that she did not take up the suggestion to bring the child to the alternative assessment centre as she felt it would be better for the assessments at the hospital to be completed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>The local hospital is well known and regarded for its services in the development of infants and children and the ex-wife’s choice appears prudent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I intervened on one specific issue and that was in relation to the choice of primary school. Again, it is hoped that parties will agree but given that the need to register the child for primary school was coming up in July and parties were still unable to agree, I allowed the ex-wife to make that decision. The ex-wife had moved out with the child, has remarried and has permanent accommodation in Yishun. Her choice of school was one that was proximate to her new home. Given the imminent need to make a decision on the choice of school, I allowed the mother to make the decision as she was the main caregiver of the child at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Shared care and control – is further refinement necessary?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When the consent order on ancillary matters was made, the parties were living together. At the time this application was taken for variation, they were still in the same home. What then was the basis for the variation that was sought? It was the ex-husband’s position that the ex-wife restricted his time with his child and that the child was alienated from him. He pointed to the presence of the ex-wife’s new partner as instrumental in this difficulty.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>I found this hard to appreciate because the ex-wife was working and there were many times when the ex-husband was alone with his son. It was the ex-wife’s position that her former spouse never engaged with his son and that much of the interaction was with the domestic helper. She denied that access was prevented or restricted by her. They both attempted to show photographs and recordings to prove their point. I did not find any evidence of alienation. Indeed, it is difficult to make such a determination without a hearing which enables the evidence to be tested (<b><em>WQT</em></b> v <b><em>WQU</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> What is clear however is that a few supervised visitation sessions at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA) were scheduled for the ex-husband to connect with the child. It was the ex-husband’s position that it had ceased because the counsellors were of the view that the father-son relationship was good and there was no need for the sessions to continue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife claimed that it was the ex-husband who wanted to terminate the access at the DSSA as seen in the messages from the DSSA<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and that it showed how reluctant he was to participate or be truly involved in the child’s life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> If indeed as stated by the ex-husband, his interaction with his son was good at least during supervised access, any allegation that the ex-wife had successfully alienated the child is unlikely. It is more probable that the child is somewhat caught in the middle of parents who no longer get along. With the parents now living apart, creating a safe space and time for father and son will if the opportunity is taken up, be the beginning of a new and better relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As the ex-wife and child had left the home they shared with the ex-husband by the time this matter came up for hearing, I felt it prudent to define the dates and times when the father should have the child with him and provide care for him. I defined the days to be Wednesdays to Fridays (till 8 p.m.) which in my view is long enough to enable good contact and the provision of relevant care in the larger context of little to no access in the recent past and the father’s own position that as recently as September 2023 the access to his child was positive and did not require external intervention. At the same time, it was short enough to prevent a situation where the child having just moved to a new home would need to make significant changes to his routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the dates and times that I had allowed the ex-husband to use to care for his son do effectively take the form of access rather than shared care and control, I chose not to define it as such as this application is in my view rather premature and would benefit from further assessment in the year ahead. The arrangement put in place is not ideal because the child will be in primary 1 next year yet it is necessary at this time given that the ex-husband needs to be engaged with the child immediately and consistently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With formal schooling, the need for change to the orders is inevitable. An assessment taking into account where the child will be studying and living as well as the demands of school life would need to be made. I had given liberty to parties to vary this order at the appropriate time. At the time of the hearing, I was not entirely certain of important aspects which may determine the way forward for parties. There was suggestion for example that the ex-husband may remarry. A more permanent care arrangement would be contingent on aspects like the child’s residence, new family structures, the location of the child’s primary school, the school schedules, and whether he will be placed in a student care after school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was also the father’s request that if the child is brought out by the ex-wife, she would need to return him home by 9 p.m. and that no third party should be present during these outings. With the mother’s remarriage, the child’s family structure has changed even as his biological father should certainly continue with all the rights and responsibilities that come with a parent-child relationship. As for the child returning home by 9 p.m. everyday, I thought this too restrictive as there would be instances when the child may have to return a little later. There was nothing in the evidence other than the ex-husband suggesting that the ex-wife had been staying out late with her partner that warranted such an order. The circumstances of the ex-wife has materially changed as well which made such a request unnecessary. She has a new child with her husband and the need to care for the differing needs of an infant and her 6-year-old son would spell very few late nights, at least for the short to medium term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Maintenance – who should payment be made to?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Under the consent order, maintenance for the child was agreed at $ 2 000 per month. The ex-husband did not dispute the need for this amount nor his ability in providing it. He wanted to vary this amount to $500 per month and in addition, he wanted to pay for the child’s educational expenses directly to the schools/childcare centres. His position was that the ex-wife was not utilising the money for the child’s educational needs as she had failed to pay for his school fees.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife responded that she had paid for it regularly but that her ex-husband had proceeded to pay it for the months of May and June without informing her. He then informed her that he would be shaving an amount off the monthly maintenance to reflect the payment he had made directly to the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There was no proof that the child only required $500 per month if and when the ex-husband provided for the child’s educational expenses separately and directly to the school. What parties accepted as expenses of the child when the matter was mediated is not known. Food, clothing, medical expenses, accommodation are basic expenses which maintenance seeks to help support. The arbitrary sum of $500 was not adequately supported by documentation. He also did not share what educational expenses he was willing to provide directly for. Would it include for example, the assessments and therapy? What if more therapy is required? The husband appears to want control of what he pays for and I did not find that the ex-wife had intentionally refused to cater for their son from the maintenance given to her. Having said that, and while there was no material change in circumstances nor any good reason to vary the maintenance payment agreed to, it is important to prevent any fear of child maintenance being misused especially because it is a long-term commitment by the paying party. In some cases, it would promote understanding between parties for the receiving party to account for the expenses of the child which may change quite dramatically for young children entering different phases in their education. The ex-wife for example said that she had engaged tutors for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Additionally, she wanted to continue to have the child remain at the same childcare centre till the child enters primary 1 which the husband was not in agreement with. The ex-husband should be provided with documentation that these expenses continue to be relevant and I ordered that documentation for all school fees, childcare fees, tuition and medical expenses be notified to the ex-husband. The other expenses such as food, clothing and accommodation need not be accounted and was clearly within contemplation of the parties when the agreement for an amount of $2 000 per month was entered into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Should counselling be ordered for the child?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     One of the cornerstones of therapeutic justice is counselling and psychological services which if appropriately applied, can have a tremendous positive long-term impact on the lives of families. It is important however not to seek counselling for a 6-year-old child without any reference to the nature of the difficulty the child is experiencing and the type of programme that is being sought. The ex-husband through his counsel had not explained why only the child needed counselling and what exactly needed to be addressed. It is important to be mindful that the court cannot assume the nature of intervention. Counsel forwarding such requests should be clear on what, why and who they wish to engage for the specified purpose. There are many programmes available, and it is the obligation of counsel and his client to inform of the concerns and challenges. If it is to address access issues, these would already have been done at the DSSA which has not terminated its services. If it is to address developmental concerns, counselling would not be appropriate. In any event, the ex-wife seems to have taken steps in this regard at the local children’s hospital. I had in my orders called on the counselling and psychological services within the family court to engage the parties on appropriate channels of assistance if they required support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Who should hold the child’s passport?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The ex-husband sought that the passport of the child be given to him. He expressed fear that the ex-wife would leave Singapore with the child. Although the wife is Thai, there is no indication that she would flee to Thailand to prevent any contact with the ex-husband. She is married with her new family in Singapore. The only time she went to Thailand in the recent past was in 2023 after the challenges of the pandemic restored travel fully. She claimed that she was prevented from travelling by the ex-husband prior to this and disagreed with any suggestion of an intention to run off with her child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>I found no need to have the passport retained by the ex-husband. If she wishes to take the child abroad, she should be free to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Costs</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The ex-husband appeals against my order on costs. I had ordered that the parties were to bear his or her own costs for the matter. The ex-husband succeeded in part but was largely unsuccessful. I found his positions rooted in a sense of mistrust of the intentions of his ex-wife who has started a new life in Singapore rather than any real difficulty in engaging with his son. The issues were not complex, and the ex-husband had filed 2 affidavits for the matter. I did not believe that this was a case for an order of costs to be made against the ex-wife who appeared in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Consent orders should not be varied with ease. In this case, the matter was mediated, and the parties agreed on all issues related to their child in 2023 only for the ex-husband to seek variation so quickly in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The need for the child to bond with his father is an imperative. The child’s step-father cannot replace the biological father-son relationship. The relationships can certainly co-exist meaningfully. Equally important is the need for the parents to start to speak civilly with each other to enhance the potential for a successful parenting journey. The consent order needs time to work. I have structured the time each parent has with the child to allow for the relationship to resume if disrupted, and to grow. The reality is that the child will commence formal schooling next year and his needs will change continuously, and an assessment would be prudent next year. It is not for the parents to dictate what they each want. It is always about what the child needs. The child’s changing circumstances will inevitably dictate the response that the parents need to adopt.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[2024] SGHC(A) at paragraph 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Section 72 of the Women’s Charter.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 19 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Tab B, page 15 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraphs 14-16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 25 of the affidavit of the ex-husband dated 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24154-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 3</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Affidavit of ex-husband dated 5 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Tab A, page 13 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 38 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Tab C, page 20 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence","Family Law – Family Violence – Self-Defence Exception","Family Law – Family Violence – Correction Exception"],"date":"2024-08-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Summons No SS 635 of 2024","title":"XBC v XBD","citation":"[2024] SGFC 63","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32020-SSP.xml","counsel":["The applicant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented"],"timestamp":"2024-08-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBC v XBD</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBC <em>v</em> XBD </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

In addition, I heard evidence from two other witnesses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A domestic helper (“Ms S”). She worked as the family’s domestic helper. The Father had called her as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother called her aunt (“Ms G”) as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Upon conclusion of the trial, I reserved my judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The following two requirements must be fulfilled before a court will grant a PPO:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Family violence must have been committed, or there is a likelihood that family violence will be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As to what constitutes family violence, that is set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is clear from the manner that family violence has been defined in the Women’s Charter 1961, that there are two exceptions: <b>a)</b> force used in self-defence (the “Self-Defence Exception”) and <b>b)</b> force used by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age (the “Correction Exception”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Insofar as evidential matters are concerned, an applicant seeking a PPO need only establish the two requirements set out above (at [6]) on a balance of probabilities and not the more stringent criminal standard of proof of “beyond reasonable doubt”: <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [22]–[28]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> [2023] SLR(FC) 1 at [25] (see <em>Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/15355-SSP-M.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 308</a> at [160] citing Lord Hoffmann in <em>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman (Consolidated Appeals)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/70538-E-M.xml')\">[2003] 1 AC 153</a> where he described the civil standard of proof as meaning “more likely than not”; see also <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> at [134] – [135] where the Court of Appeal conceptualised the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There are two ways in which a respondent to an application for a PPO can convince the court that a PPO should not be granted (see <em>TEK v TEJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a> at [13]). The first is to either show that no family violence that had been committed, or that it is not necessary for the court to grant a PPO. Alternatively, the second option available to a respondent is to invoke either the Self-Defence or the Correction Exception as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In this vein, insofar as the Self-Defence Exception is concerned, the Women’s Chater 1961 does not define what constitutes “force lawfully used in self-defence”. That being said, the court in <em>TEK v TEJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a> appeared to take the view (at [14] – [15]), that s 96 of the Penal Code concerning the right of private defence was instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    “Force lawfully used in self-defence” is not defined in the Women’s Charter, <b>but as submitted by the Respondent Counsel[note: 3], section 96 of the Penal Code regarding the right of private defence, is instructive</b>. In the case of <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/59433-M.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR 306</a>, the Court of Appeal used the explanation given in Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes: A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code 1860 vol 1 (CJ Thakker &amp; M C Thakker eds) (Bharat Law House, 26th Ed, 2007), to explain private defence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…] The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonable apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose. […] The right of private defence is purely preventive and not punitive or retributive. The right of self-defence is not a right to take revenge nor is it a right of reprisal. It does not permit retaliation.” [note: 4]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    Whether it is “force lawfully used in self-defence” therefore <b>depends on whether the force that was used was proportionate to the threat made and/or harm caused</b>; and <b>whether that force was appropriately used to meet the said threat and/or harm</b> (ie. the force was not an act of retaliation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I would add that in assessing whether the force used was proportionate and whether that force was appropriately used, one must also bear in mind the fact that PPO applications taken out under the Women’s Charter 1961 involve incidents arising in the domestic context (see s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 which sets out the persons who may apply for a PPO). The close relationship between the applicant and respondent in applications for a PPO under the Women’s Charter would accordingly colour the court’s assessment of whether the force used was proportionate, and whether that force was appropriately used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As for the Correction Exception, its history and rationale was usefully set out in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [10] – [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The Correction Exception as a “Thick Grey Line”</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    The Correction Exception has its roots in the common law, which has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline to correct misbehaviour by a child. This includes some degree of physical or corporal punishment. The limit on this authority to discipline is located in the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”), which prohibits an adult from ill-treating a child (<em>TCV (On behalf of Child, A) v TCU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16808-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 3</a> (“<em>TCV</em>”) at [13] citing Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018, 3rd Ed) (“<em>Elements of Family Law</em>”) at paragraph 5.029).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    Despite growing suggestion internationally that physical punishment produces detrimental consequences in children, as the Family Court noted in <em>TCV</em> at [16], the Correction Exception remains a part of the law in Singapore. It operates as a “thick grey line” that accommodates different parenting approaches affected by culture, personality, or personal experience. Parenting behaviour that falls within this “grey” area “may not be the best parenting practices but neither does such behaviour necessarily justify state intervention”. But beyond these limits, the behaviour even if consistent with variations in culture, personality, or personal experience will be abuse or ill-treatment and attract state intervention (Debbie Ong Siew Ling, “The Quest for Optimal State Intervention in Parenting Children: Navigating within the Thick Grey Line” (2011) SJLS 61 at 80).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The boundaries of the “Thick Grey Line”</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12    Any lawful correction of a child “must be to teach discipline with a measure of good sense and must always be exercised for the benefit of the child.” If it had been prompted by a need of the parent to impose his power over the child rather than for the benefit of the child, the Correction Exception may not hold. The conduct would then be family violence (TCV at [13] citing Elements of Family Law at paragraph 5.030). The correction must also have been performed in a “responsible and loving” manner and have not descended into abuse that caused “unnecessary pain and suffering” (<em>TCV</em> at [14]). It must further have been “delivered in a judicious and responsible manner for the child’s benefit” (<em>TCV</em> at [70]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">13    In <em>R v Hopeley</em> [1860] EW Misc J73 (“<em>Hopeley</em>”), Cockburn CJ examined the contents of the “moderate and reasonable” physical punishment of a child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">By the law of England, a parent … may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable. If it be administered for the gratification of passion or of rage, or if it be immoderate and excessive in its nature or degree, or if it be protracted beyond the child's powers of endurance, or with an instrument unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce danger to life or limb; in all such cases the punishment is excessive, the violence is unlawful, and if evil consequences to life or limb ensue, then the person inflicting it is answerable to the law, and if death ensues it will be manslaughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    By reference to <em>Hopeley</em>, Professor Chan Wing Cheong helpfully identified several related factors that shed light on the reasonableness of the physical punishment by a parent of a child (Chan Wing Cheong, “Corporal Punishment of Children by Parents: Is it Discipline or Violence and Abuse?” <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Journal/101471.xml')\">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 545</a> (“Corporal Punishment of Children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)     <b>First, the reasons for the punishment.</b> To fall within the Correction Exception, the force must have been used for the correction of misbehaviour for the benefit of the child. Force used for the “gratification of passion or rage”, in the words of <em>Hopeley</em>, will not qualify. Such was the case in TCV, where the respondent-mother had, following her dispute with her own father, lashed out at the child. That force was used other than for the correction of misbehaviour. It was therefore family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>Second, the nature of the punishment.</b> As Professor Chan suggests, types of force like punching may be unacceptable per se, presumably because they are beyond what any reasonable person would consider to be suitable correction. Other types of force like caning fall to be assessed against the other circumstances of the case. The decision in <em>BHR v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18370-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 2</a>, which involved the punching and caning of a child, is instructive. The Juvenile Court distinguished the punching from the caning, and found that the punching was, without more, “beyond the act of disciplining”. But it assessed the caning based on the “number and extent” of the bruises caused. Similarly, in <em>BJJ v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18371-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 3</a>, the Juvenile Court held that the acts of kicking the head and body, hitting the head with a bunch of keys, and hitting the face and causing a nosebleed automatically went “beyond reasonable disciplining”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)     <b>Third, the age and personal characteristics of the child.</b> These factors take on especial significance in <b>the case of young children, given their limited maturity and ability to endure physical punishment</b>. As Professor Chan observes in Corporal Punishment of Children, <b>for any correction to benefit a child, it must be “commensurate with the age and extent of understanding of the child”</b> (citing <em>Public Prosecutor v AFR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0833.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 833</a> at [33]).A harsh regime especially inappropriate for young children, “who should be treated with more love and tender care” (citing <em>Public Prosecutor v AQF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0075.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 75</a> at [29]) and whose correction, in the words of <em>Hopeley</em>, should not be “protracted beyond the child’s power of endurance”. These statements accord with the observations in TCV at [14] that any punishment must not cause “unnecessary pain and suffering” to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In summary, the inclusion of the Correction Exception reflects parliamentary intent to give parents a wide degree of discretion when it comes to disciplining their children. That parliament had intended to do so was recently emphasised during the Second Reading of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment Bill) (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (3 Sept 2019) vol 94) (“Second Reading”). During the Second Reading, Member of Parliament (“MP”) Mr Christopher de Souza had asked:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…With regard to the amended section 4(2) which sets out specific examples of emotional or psychological abuse, I do have a few clarifications for the Minister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Paragraph (a) mentions well-being and a sense of self-worth. How will this provision operate?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Paragraph (b) mentions that threatening to physically hurt the child or young person is child abuse. Will the Minister clarify how this provision is to be understood in the context of section 64 of the Women's Charter where correction is an exception to &quot;family violence&quot;?...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Mr Desmond Lee, the Minister for Social and Family Development had this to say in response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, I note that several Members of Parliament were concerned that the power to protect abused or neglected children could overly interfere with how parents legitimately discipline and raise their children. Mr Christopher de Souza touched on the definition of &quot;emotional harm&quot;. While the concepts of emotional harm, emotional abuse or psychological abuse may seem broad or subjective, what we have sought to do in the Bill is to give as much clarity as we can on what constitutes such harm or abuse, by providing some specific circumstances and then, examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For example, Mr de Souza asked what infantilisation is, in one of the examples. This occurs when a parent or guardian deliberately treats a child as being much younger than a child's actual age and in a way that is not developmentally appropriate for the child. For example, say, a child in upper Primary school being made to wear diapers every day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He also asked about the example of being confined in a small space. By that, we refer to a space that is not conducive for the child's development and is beyond socially-accepted boundaries for punishment. For example, locking a child in a cage, the toilet, the store room as a form of punishment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I wish to assure Members that <b>we do not intend to diminish parental authority. We do not intend to unduly intervene with parents' rights to discipline their children. And we do not intend to overly intrude into the private lives of families. The vast majority of parents are responsible and do their best to care for and raise their children. Within the private lives of families, within the bounds of parental authority, there is a wide berth or space for parents to nurture, raise and discipline their children. The common adage goes: &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child.&quot;</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">But unfortunately, a small number struggle to parent responsibly, for whatever reason. <b>And when parenting or so called discipline crosses the line and becomes excessively harsh or abusive, whether physically or emotionally, we may have to intervene to protect the children.</b> I gave a couple of examples yesterday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     That being said, it also bears noting that the law does not intervene through the issuance of a PPO in <em>every</em> instance of parenting that exceeds the Correction Exception. Even if the parenting behaviour complained of discloses family violence, pursuant to s 65 of the Charter, a PPO will not be granted unless it is necessary for the protection of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father should be granted a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having set out the law, I turn now to deal with the Father’s application for a PPO. As mentioned (above at [2]), the basis for his application is founded on the incident where the Mother had, in the midst of their argument, gone to the kitchen, taken a 15 cm long vegetable knife and threatened to stab him with it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At trial, the Father testified that while he could not recall the exact date this incident took place, he remembered that on the day of that incident, he was going out to drink with some friends. He had gotten into a huge argument with the Mother. He admitted to beating her, but also stated that she had retaliated. In the midst of their fight, the Mother ran to the kitchen, grabbed a vegetable knife that was about 15 cm long and said “you want to see me stab you now?”. He retorted: “go ahead and stab me”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Subsequently, the police were called. They confiscated the knife and spoke to the couple. The Father explained that, for the sake of his two young sons, he did not want to escalate things by pursuing the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother was able to, in her testimony, recount the incident in more detail than the Father had. She explained that the incident had taken place on 10 December 2023. The night before, on 9 December, she had attended, together with the Father, a party to celebrate her friend’s brother getting married.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the morning of 10 December, the Mother recounted that she had woken up at about 9 am in the morning. After checking in on the children, she went to buy some meat as they were supposed to do some prayers for her late mother-in-law. She returned home with the groceries as well as lunch. The helper took the food to feed the children and she settled down to have her lunch. The Mother recounts that the Father had woken up at about 12.50 pm. He asked her where she had gone. She told him that she had gone out to buy groceries. The Father asked her again where she had gone. He knew that doing so would annoy her as she did not like being asked the same question repeatedly. The spark that ignited the entire fight came when the Mother raised her voice and gave the same answer to the Father’s repeated questioning as to where she had gone. This, according to the Mother, triggered him: he began to hurl vulgarities and attacked her by punching her face and slapping her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother had, by this time, lost her appetite. She went to the sofa. The Father did not relent. He continued to hurl vulgarities at her and began to beat her up. The Mother told the helper to bring the two young sons into the room to prevent them from being affected by witnessing the violence being inflicted on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Unable to put up with the Father’s continued physical assault, the Mother stood up, went to the kitchen, and took a kitchen knife. She says that this was done purely with the intention of defending herself. The Mother explained that the Father would not listen to her and that threatening him with a knife was the only way to stop him from continuing to hit her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Upon being threatened with the knife, the Father backed off – this gave the Mother the opportunity to escape to the room where her children were taking shelter. Unfortunately, it appears that the Father’s temper did not abate because, according to the Mother, he followed her into the room and continued the argument. She ran out of the room to the kitchen again – the Father followed her and continued to physically assault her by pulling her hair and punching her. Both children witnessed this – they were screaming and crying as they watched their parents fighting. The Mother eventually ended up calling the police who arrived a short while later and took statements from her as well as the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     While the police were taking the Mother’s statement, her aunt arrived. As it turned out, the helper had called the Mother’s aunt to tell her that there was a big incident happening and that she should come quickly. The aunt scolded the Father for what he had done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother candidly stated that she had admitted to the police that she had taken the knife, but that she had done so because there was no other way for her to stop the violence. The Mother also explained that the police had, in the wake of that incident, advised the both of them to stay apart for the time being. The Father left the house in the afternoon and only returned at about 11.30pm at night. After that incident, the Mother did not speak to the Father for about a month until the Father, sometime on the 28<sup>th</sup> or 29<sup>th</sup> of December, tried to make amends, explaining that he wished to resolve matters before the new year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It was clear to me, from the evidence that both the Father and the Mother had given, that there was indeed a fight that had taken place, and that in the course of that fight, the Mother had taken a vegetable knife and threatened to stab the Father. Indeed, the Mother does not deny that she had done so, but, as she had explained, that was the only way to stop the Father from continuing to violently assault her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     This act of threatening to stab the Father with the vegetable knife does, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 – specifically, that it constitutes an act which wilfully or knowingly places, or attempts to place, a family member in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     That said, I also find that the Mother is entitled to invoke the Self-Defence Exception in this case. She had testified that she would get into fights with the Father, and that in those fights, the Father would “turn into a beast”. The Mother’s evidence was that she would walk away from those fights with multiple injuries and that it took her a few weeks to recover from such cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I do not doubt that the Father had indeed beaten the Mother, not only on the incident on 10 December 2023, but also on other occasions. The Father had admitted to this. For instance, he said that on the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2024, the both of them had gotten into an argument and that he had also beaten her on that occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The picture that emerged from the testimony I heard was that whenever there was a fight between the couple (which appears to have taken place with startling frequency), it was the Mother who would walk away thoroughly battered and bruised. From what I could tell, she endured these beatings – indeed, as she testified, she was shocked when her aunt turned up on the scene on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December. Her reaction is telling. It suggested that while she did tell her aunt about the physical abuse she suffered, she had attempted to conceal the true extent of the physical abuse she had suffered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given this, and taking into account the violence and brutality of the fight that took place on 10 December, one can understand why the Mother had acted in the way she did. As I have mentioned above, the proportionality of the force used as well as its suitability must be assessed bearing in mind that these incidents took place in the domestic context. In such situations, where the frequency and intensity of the violence has reached its apex, the victim who has been trapped in repeated cycles of abuse may simply have no choice but to respond in kind. The threat which the Mother levelled at the Father during the fight was therefore, in my judgment, proportionate and suitable when weighed against the violence she faced. I accept her explanation that all she wanted to do was to disengage from the fight and that this was the only way she could do so given that the Father, in the heat of his anger, would not respond to reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Father’s application for a PPO for himself is therefore dismissed. I am satisfied that the Mother is entitled to rely on the Self-Defence exception – this means that there was no family violence on her part. In any event, given that both the Father and Mother are now living apart, it would not have been necessary to grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether [A] and [B] should be granted a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I turn now to consider whether the two young sons, [A] and [B] should be granted a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The gist of the Father’s complaint was that the Mother would discipline both the sons by hitting and threatening them. He recounted the following incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The first incident allegedly took place on 18 February 2024 – the Father says that the Mother had beaten the youngest son, [A], so hard that he could make out hand marks on his face and chest. According to the Father, he had only discovered this when the Mother had left the house and the helper had shown him pictures of the hand marks on [A]’s face and chest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The second incident, according to the Father, took place on 19 March 2024. The Mother had slapped the eldest son because he did not want to go to school and was crying. The helper, Ms S, witnessed this incident. In her testimony, Ms S said that the Mother was walking from the bus stop to drop both the sons off at school. [B] was holding on to the Mother’s hand and crying. Because [B] was crying, the Mother slapped him on the cheek. [B] continued to sob and the Mother tried to console him. The Mother left the two children with Ms S and left for work. Ms S said there was a playground near the bus stop – she brought both the boys there and fed them food before sending them off to school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Mother had a different account of this incident. She claims that she did not hit [B]. According to the Mother, [B] was crying because he did not want to go to school. She also said that it was not true that she had left both children with Ms S and went off to work. The Mother’s version was that she brought both children to the playground where the Ms S had fed them. Thereafter, Ms S had brought [A] to his school, while the Mother brought [B] to his school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The third incident occurred on 23 April 2024. The Father explained that the Mother had, ever since she moved out, denied him access to his two sons. He finally managed to persuade her to let him spend some time with them on 23 April 2024, on the account that it was his eldest son’s birthday. She agreed to let him spend an hour with them, and brought both the boys over to his flat at 3pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father was delighted that he could finally spend some time with his two sons. He brought out the cake and birthday present. It was at this time that the helper noticed that there was a mark on [A]’s cheek. He asked [B] if the Mother had beaten [A]. [B] did not respond. The Father took [B] to the kitchen and recorded a video where he asked [B] if the Mother had hit him – in the video, [B] said that she had. The Father explained that because of the limited time he had with both of his sons, he decided against bringing [A] to the hospital for a checkup – instead, he went to make a police report after he had returned [A] and [B] to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In relation to this incident on 23 April 2024, the helper, Ms S, had given evidence that she had seen the marks on [A]’s face and that she knew that it had been inflicted by the Mother because she had seen the Mother mete out beatings where the blows would land near the children’s eyes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In response, the Mother’s evidence was that her dog, a chihuahua, was responsible for the mark on [A]’s face. According to her, the dog had scratched [A]’s face under the eyes. The Mother also explained that while she knew that the Father would use this against her, she did not see the need to keep evidence to prove her actions to others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Apart from these incidents, the Father also produced a video dated 13 January 2024 along with a transcription of the audio. The video showed the Mother yelling at [B].

She explained that she had done so to show the Mother that the children would tremble when she was scolding them. That [B] was in fear was clearly apparent to me from reviewing this clip – [B]’s leg was trembling as he stood in front of the Mother whilst being scolded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Mother attempted to cast a different light on the clip by providing a different explanation as to why Ms S had recorded it. She said that it can clearly be heard, in the video, that Ms S was asking her to ask [A] a question. If it were true that this video had shown her abusing her two children, then there was no need for Ms S to “sit there and instigate [her] to ask [A] questions”. In addition, the Mother also explained that the video was recorded to capture [A]’s cute facial expressions – according to the Mother, [A] would pout whenever she was using a firm tone. The Mother does not deny saying that she would “break both the elder and younger’s arms” – however, as she explained, when said in Tamil, the meaning of what she had said was “not as severe”, and in any event, she had no intention of breaking their arms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The crux of the dispute, insofar as the Father’s application for a PPO for [A] and [B] was concerned, was whether the Mother could rely on the Correction Exception. In other words, was the Mother’s methods of discipline towards her two young sons overly excessive such that they crossed the boundaries set by the Correction Exception and strayed into the realm of family violence as defined in the Women’s Charter 1961?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Having considered the evidence, namely, the testimony of the witnesses at trial, the Mother cannot, in my judgment, rely on the Correction Exception. I find it more likely than not (to use the definition of proof on a balance of probabilities) that the Mother’s attempts to discipline the children, had gone too far and strayed into the realm of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     For one, the Mother was a strict disciplinarian. That much was evident from the video clip dated 13 January 2024 in which she can be seen scolding [B]. Apart from that video clip, I had also asked the Mother some questions on her parenting style. The Mother shared that she wanted to raise her sons properly – this was because she had come from a broken family and had, in her work, seen children from different walks of life. To that end, she believed in disciplining the children to ensure that they would stay on the straight and narrow. She said that she needed to be the “bad cop” otherwise the children would not take her seriously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I had also asked the Mother if she had hit her children to discipline them. The Mother candidly admitted that she did – but she explained that she would only “tap” them on the cheek, on the back, and on their legs. She explained that she did not “tap” them with much force.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I asked the Mother to explain how the children would take her seriously if it was true that she did not “tap” them with much force. I did so because this appeared to contradict the picture she had painted of herself as a strict disciplinarian. As the Mother herself had explained, she had to be a strict parent otherwise the children would not take her seriously. Yet in the same breath, she professed to only gently “tapping” them, and that she did not hit them forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In response to my question, the Mother explained that the children understood her disciplinary style. Both her sons would know when she was angry and when she would “tap” them, and that she did not need to hit them in a way that would cause marks or bruises. The Mother’s explanation, however, skirts round the issue and does not squarely address how “tapping” the children was consistent with the picture of herself as a strict disciplinarian. I find it more likely to be the case that the Mother was trying to downplay the force she had used to hit [A] and [B] with the use of the word “tap”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Second, there was evidence from both the helper, Ms S, as well as the Mother’s aunt, Ms G, that the Mother had indeed hit both her sons forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Ms S had given evidence that the Mother would slap the elder son, [B] on the cheek – as for the younger son, [A], she would beat him on the hands and legs. Whenever the Mother beat the children, Ms S would intervene and tell her not to hit the child like this, especially on the face and eyes. However, according to Ms S, her words would fall on deaf ears – the Mother would tell her to mind her own business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I note, at this juncture, that Ms S’s account about telling the Mother not to hit the children on their face or legs was corroborated by the Mother’s own evidence. I had asked the Mother if Ms S had ever spoken to her about the manner in which she had disciplined her children. The Mother said that Ms S had told her not to “tap” the children on the face or the leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In addition, Ms S also stated that she would cry whenever she saw the children being beaten. She explained that, in an effort to convince the Mother to change her ways, she would take pictures to show the Mother after she had calmed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Finally, although the Mother claimed that the Father had pressured Ms S into giving evidence, she did not ask Ms S this when afforded the opportunity to cross-examine her, nor did she put forward any evidence to show that she had indeed been pressured by the Father into doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In any event, I would add that having watched Ms S’s demeanour on the stand, I did not get the impression that she had been pressured into testifying, or that she could be pressurised to do such a thing. Ms S had given evidence that she left her first employer after working for them for 1 year and 4 months. She explained that they had ended up mistreating her and blaming her when things went wrong. The inference I draw from this was that Ms S was not someone that could be bullied – she knew how to stand up for herself, and how to walk away. In this vein, I would also add that Ms S struck me as an honest witness who cared deeply for [A] and [B] even though they were not her own flesh and blood. That was apparent, not only from her testimony, but by her reaction to the video dated 13 January 2024 (see above at [43]) being played in court: she had broken down, sobbing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Insofar as Ms G was concerned, her evidence was that she had never seen the Mother beat the children when they visited her house – she only saw the Mother “tap” them on the leg or thigh when they were running about. However, when I asked Ms G to demonstrate how hard the Mother had “tapped” the children, Ms G demonstrated the tapping action and then went on to explain that if the Mother had “done a very hard hit”, she would correct her and tell her that “this was not the way for her to hit the child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It was therefore clear to me as well, from what Ms G had said in her testimony, that the Mother did forcefully hit her children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In summary, the picture painted by the evidence, as well as the inferences which I drew, was that the Mother had gone overboard and crossed the line when it came to disciplining [A] and [B]. It is after all, undisputed that she did hit them. What was in dispute was the <em>force</em> that she had used and whether her methods of discipline were appropriate given that [A] and [B] were but mere toddlers. It goes without saying that any correction to benefit a child must be commensurate with the child’s age and understanding. In that regard, I find that the Mother had not only hit them forcefully, but in vulnerable places such as their faces – this was not, in my judgment, an appropriate form of discipline considering the tender age of [A] and [B] (see <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [14(c)] citing Chan Wing Cheong, “Corporal Punishment of Children by Parents: Is it Discipline or Violence and Abuse?” <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Journal/101471.xml')\">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 545</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To be clear, I am not saying that the Mother had, in hitting her children, acted out of malice. Simply put, what I have found is that it is more likely than not that the Mother had hit both [A] and [B] in such a manner that disentitles her from relying on the Correction Exception – and accordingly, those acts constituted family violence as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Indeed, from the Mother’s own testimony, it was clear to me that she wanted to raise her sons to be good and honest men. I believe that she does indeed have their best interests at heart. What I have said in this judgment should therefore not be taken as an indictment of the Mother as a parent. After all, parenting is only something that can be learnt through hard-won experience. Mistakes will be made. In some cases, the severity of that mistake demands that the parent be prosecuted. In other cases, the parent may be given a chance to learn and adjust their parenting style to ensure that it does not cross the lines laid down by the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It is in this spirit that I am granting a PPO in favour of [A] and [B] for a fixed term of a year (till 13 August 2025). This is to afford the Mother the time to learn better ways of parenting and disciplining [A] and [B]. It is necessary to grant a PPO because the Mother is currently staying alone with [A] and [B], and the three of them only visit Ms G’s house twice a month. Given the present living arrangement, there is nobody else present on a daily basis that may, as Ms G has done (see above at [58]), moderate or balance the Mother’s disciplinary methods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Finally, and in addition to the PPO, I am also ordering that the Mother attend counselling. This will provide her with the necessary resources and support in her journey to improve on her parenting methods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     It was not lost on me that both the Father and the Mother had an acrimonious relationship that was fuelled by resentment accumulated over their years together. During the trial, both the Father and the Mother had angrily accused each other of adultery. At times, the cross-examination became a heated and emotional exchange between the two.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Despite the state of their relationship, it was apparent to me that both the Father, as well as the Mother, did have their sons’ interests at heart. In this vein, I emphasise that they must not drag the children into their own conflict (see also the remarks made in <em>WAG v WAH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27153-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 17</a> at [95]). I understand that both the Father and Mother are contemplating divorce but the end of a marriage does not spell the end of their parenting obligations. [A] and [B] are still young and will require the love and support from both their parents. To that end, both the Father and the Mother must learn to work together and do the very best that they can for them.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Disclosure of company – documents","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 877 of 2023 (Summons No 1978 and 1979 of 2024)","title":"XBI v XBJ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 66","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32013-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ivan Cheong, Shaun Ho, Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBI v XBJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBI <em>v</em> XBJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32013-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 66</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 877 of 2023 (Summons No 1978 and 1979 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ivan Cheong, Shaun Ho, Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBI — XBJ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Disclosure of company</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">documents</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Husband and the Wife are British citizens. They were married on 8 December 2007 in the United Kingdom. They had four children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 1 August 2019, the entire family relocated to Singapore. They have lived here since. That they have lived here for a period of three years immediately preceding the filing of the divorce provides the basis for the Family Court having jurisdiction over their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) sets out, in detail, how the Husband had behaved in such a manner such that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Specifically, it is disclosed that the Husband was not only financially irresponsible in that he racked up enormous debts, but that he had also been cruel and unkind towards the Wife. It appears, from the SOP, that the Husband’s behaviour was, in part, fuelled by the suspicion that the Wife had been having an affair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 February 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 18 May 2023. Parties embarked on the road towards the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is against this backdrop that the Wife took out her application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1979/2024 (“SUM 1979”) and SUM 1978/2024 (“SUM 1978”) respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       By the time the matter had come up for hearing, counsel for the Wife had whittled down the items they were seeking in discovery and interrogatories. In the end, the Wife only pursued five items in respect of discovery. The Husband, having discharged his lawyers, was unrepresented at the hearing. I heard both SUM 1978 and 1979 on 12 August 2024 and reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I shall deal with Items 1 and 2 given that they both related to the Husband’s bank account statements. These were the requests as had been framed in Items 1 and 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Item 1:</b> the Husband’s consolidated bank statements for his accounts with DBS and POSB for May 2021 to February 2023 and June 2023 to December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Item 2:</b> the Husband’s bank statements for his Wise Account – for May 2021 to December 2022, July 2023 to December 2023 and April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As counsel for the Wife, Ms Imogen Harvey (“Ms Harvey”) had argued at the hearing, the salient issue in respect of Items 1 and 2 was that the Wife required these statements to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. This was because the Husband had been financially irresponsible, and in addition, there was a dearth of documentation evidencing his income and expenses. In addition, Ms Harvey explained that the statements were also needed to ascertain whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Ms Harvey also referred to the decision in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> where the court had, at [26(d)] and [27], affirmed the principle laid down by the court in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> that it is useful for the court as well as the party seeking discovery to have a “picture of the other party’s financial circumstances just before the marriage broke down, during the break down of the marriage, and after the filing of divorce proceedings”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, the Husband disputed that he had been financially irresponsible. He said that he did not understand why there was a need for him to disclose bank statements going back to 2021. The Husband also expressed frustration that money was being spent on lawyers to litigate the divorce when that money could be better spent on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In deciding whether to order discovery, I bear in mind the twin principles of relevance and necessity – that the documents sought must be both relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matter. The point of the discovery process, after all, is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matter has all the evidence placed before them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 1 and 2. I agree with the point that Ms Harvey had made – that it is useful for the court as well as the Wife, to have an insight into the Husband’s financial situation in the months leading up to and after the filing of the divorce. This is especially since the SOP discloses that the Husband’s behaviour towards the Wife had begun to deteriorate on or around January 2022, marking the beginning of the end of the parties’ relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The bank statements sought would also provide a clearer picture as to the Husband’s financial situation, especially in the months leading up to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to Item 3. This was a request for the bank statements of a company, XL. Although the Husband had stated in his Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that XL was a partnership, this does not appear to be the case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Wife had, in her supporting affidavit for SUM 1979, disclosed a printout from a search done on the UK register of companies which showed that XL was a private limited company that had been incorporated on 12 October 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The same printout also discloses that the Husband is one of two directors of XL, and that he owns more than 25% but not more than 50% of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Following from this, it is the principles relating to the disclosure of company documents that had been laid down in the High Court decision of <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (“<em>ACW</em>”) (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194), which are applicable in the present case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">20    More directly, a helpful summary of the relevant principles relating to discovery of documents belonging to a company of which the husband was a director and shareholder can be found in <em>B v B</em> at 193–194:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The documents of a company are in the legal possession of the company. If they are or have been in the actual physical possession of a director who is a party to litigation they must be disclosed by that director, if relevant to the litigation, even though he holds them as servant or agent of the company in his capacity as an officer of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    If the director who is a party to the litigation does not have physical possession of the documents, the question of fact of whether the documents are within the power of the director arises. “Power” in this context means “the enforceable right to inspect or obtain possession or control of the document” in the personal capacity of the director. This is in contradistinction to the right to inspect vested in a director in his capacity as a director. Without the consent of the company, the director has no right to inspect the documents. Much will depend on the share structure of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    If the company is the alter ego of such a director so that he has unfettered control of the company’s affairs, he must disclose and produce all relevant documents in the possession of the company. Where the company is not the alter ego of a director, the factors to be considered are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    the extent of the shareholding of the husband;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   whether it amounts to control of the company;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   whether the minority shareholders are adverse to him;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iv)   how the board of directors is constituted; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(v)    whether there is any objection by the board to disclosure of any of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    A very wide range of issues are relevant in proceedings relating to ancillary matters. The court has to assess what the husband is shown to have, but also what could reasonably be made available to him. In many cases, audited accounts of companies of which the husband is a shareholder will be sufficient, together with full disclosure of all the husband’s personal financial records. But there are cases when the court will go behind company accounts and order discovery of company books and documents. It is not usual, however, for the court to take this course unless there is evidence before it from accountants or other experts that the published accounts of the company cannot be relied upon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Where relevant documents in the possession of a company are disclosed by a director as being in his custody or power, the court has a discretion whether or not to order production of them. In exercising the discretion, the court will have regard to all the circumstances and balance the relevance and importance of the documents and the hardship likely to be caused to the wife by non-production against any prejudice to the husband and third parties likely to be caused by production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    It has not hitherto been the practice of the court to order production of company documents to which the board of directors objects on affidavit, provided that the court is satisfied that the objection is not contrived for the purpose of frustrating the powers of the court. The court will not in the exercise of its discretion order parties to do that which they have no power to do. The court will not order production unless it is satisfied that production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the issues between the parties or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Where the wife cannot obtain documents on discovery, she may be able to apply for leave to issue a subpoena against the secretary or other officers of the company to produce relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The principles in <em>ACW</em> formed the foundation of Ms Harvey’s argument. She argued that the statements which the Wife sought were in the Husband’s control – this is because the Husband had disclosed some documents belonging to XL. As to the relevance and necessity of this documents, Ms Harvey highlighted the possibility that the Husband was using XL’s bank account as though it were his own. These documents would therefore demonstrate whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets, and were also relevant to ascertaining the true extent of the Husband’s financial means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, the Husband said that he was willing to provide XL’s certified accounts which would give the Wife a picture as to XL’s financial transactions. Those certified accounts, however, would only be available at the end of February.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3. I agree with Ms Harvey’s arguments on the relevance and necessity of these documents. I also find that these documents are either within the Husband’s physical possession or power to obtain (see <em>ACW</em> at [20(a)] and [20(b)]). After all, the Husband had disclosed a copy of XL’s unaudited financial statement for the year ended 31 October 2022 in his XL.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This suggests that he may have other company documents, including its bank statements, in his physical possession. Even if he does not, that he was able to disclose XL’s unaudited financial statement and offer to disclose its certified accounts certainly suggests that he can obtain and produce the documents that the Wife seeks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I come now to Item 4. This was a request for the Husband to produce documents evidencing the model and registration year for his vehicle. As Ms Harvey explained – the Wife needed these documents to verify the Husband’s assertion that this vehicle was worth £1500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s response was that the Wife could have easily obtained the model and registration number of his vehicle from the documents that he had already disclosed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. If the Husband claims that vehicle is worth a certain amount, he accordingly bears the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to Item 5. This was a request for the financial statements of XL for the financial year ending 2023. Ms Harvey highlighted that the Husband had no objections to producing these statements but he had also said that they were not ready. The Wife was thus seeking an order that the Husband disclose these statements once they had been prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ms Harvey also pointed out that there was no overlap between the Wife’s request in Item 5 and Item 3. This was because the financial statements were needed to value the Husband’s shares in XL, whereas the bank statements were needed to determine if the Husband was indeed using XL as his “piggy-bank”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I allow the Wife’s request in Item 5. The financial statements of XL are certainly relevant to valuing the Husband’s shares in the company. For completeness, I would note that the court’s power to order discovery also extends to documents that will come into existence at some point in the future: <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [20] citing <em>G v G (Financial Provision: Discovery)</em> [1992] 1 FLR 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       S/N 3(a) – 3(c) (see Item 1 above at [8(a)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       S/N 3(d) (see Item 2 above at [8(b)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       S/N 3(e) (see Item 3 above at [14]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       S/N 2 (see Item 5 above at [22])</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>of the Annex to SUM 1979, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Apart from the above orders, I also direct that the Husband file his affidavit complying with the orders that I have made for discovery by 16 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to the costs of SUM 1978 and 1979, Ms Harvey argued that the Husband should pay the Wife costs fixed at $5000. Disbursements came in at $370. She argued that a robust costs order should be made to take into account the multiple delays occasioned by the actions of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, the Husband said that there should no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The starting point is that the successful party is entitled to costs, though the court can depart from that starting position if the circumstances of the case warrant it: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> citing Rule 852 and Rule 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife had substantially succeeded in her application for discovery. She is therefore entitled to costs. I order the Husband to pay the Wife costs fixed at $2750 (all-in). This sum is to be paid by 16 September 2024. In arriving at this decision, I take into account the fact that the Wife did not ultimately proceed with her application for interrogatories, that the matter was not particularly complex, the length of the affidavits that had been filed as well as the work done by the Wife’s counsel in filing written submissions. This quantum of costs also accounts for the Husband’s dilatory conduct, specifically, that he was habitually late in meeting court deadlines despite having been represented by counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Finally, I would add that based on the facts before me, I did not think that the relationship between the parties was so acrimonious as to warrant making no order as to costs (see <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it remains for me to commend Ms Harvey for her excellent advocacy at the hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>SOP at para 2b(i).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at para 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 1979 at pp 45 – 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at Tab 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>The Notice of Intention to Act in Person, In Place of Solicitor was only filed on 18 July 2024 – this was after the final case conference where SUM 1978 and 1979 were fixed for hearing before me.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)","title":"XBG v XBH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 65","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32012-SSP.xml","counsel":["Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBG v XBH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBG <em>v</em> XBH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 65</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I heard parties on 7 August, and now give my decision in respect of SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background to SUM 1204</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the facts as disclosed in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The Husband is a Singapore citizen, and the Wife is Vietnamese. They were married in Singapore and registered their marriage on 27 February 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties welcomed a son (“A”) into their family. Aside from A, the Wife also had another son (“X”) who was born out of wedlock. A and X are aged 7 and 15 respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The SOP tells us why their marriage broke down. It sets out details of how the Husband had behaved in such an unreasonable manner that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. She filed for divorce on 19 April 2023, and interim judgment was granted on 2 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. Given that the Wife had refused to disclose certain documents and did not satisfactorily answer the interrogatories posed during the voluntary disclosure process, the Husband took out SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I turn now to deal first with the Husband’s application for discovery. I add that I am proceeding primarily on the basis of <em>oral</em> arguments made by both the Husband as well as counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo Eng Chye (“Mr Teo”), at the hearing before me. Although Mr Teo had, on 18 July 2024, put in a set of written submissions purportedly addressing the Husband’s application in SUM 1204, those submissions appeared to have dealt solely with ancillary matters. I could find nothing in that set of written submissions dealing with the issues of discovery or interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In deciding whether to order discovery, I am guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity. In other words, the Husband must demonstrate that the documents which he is seeking discovery of are both relevant and necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>WXI v WXJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31581-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 31</a> at [6] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10]; Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In this connection, it must be noted that a liberal view is generally taken as to what is considered relevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters – this is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matters has all the evidence before them to arrive at a decision: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [23] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> was a request for the Wife to provide the monthly statements for the following bank accounts in her name for the past 2 years:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS account ending -6;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     OCBC account ending -xx1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     MayBank account ending -x5; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     An account jointly held with X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband explained that these statements were relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Wife’s earning capacity, specifically, how much money she was making from the business that she was running. Apart from this, the Husband also argued that the bank statements would allow him, and the court, to determine if the Wife had been dissipating matrimonial assets – the Husband had pointed to a withdrawal of some $20,000 from one of the Wife’s accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo, argued that the Wife had already disclosed all the documents that she had, and that it was impossible to retrieve documents dating that far back. In respect of the joint account with X, Mr Teo said that X was not the Husband’s adopted son. The Wife’s position appears to be that because X is not the Husband’s adopted son, he is a third party and so there is no need for the Wife to disclose the statements of that joint account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     What Mr Teo said drew a sharp response from the Husband who argued vigorously that he was indeed X’s father. The Husband explained to me that he had signed all of X’s adoption papers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1. The two-year period of disclosure which the Husband seeks also covers the months leading up to the Wife’s filing of the divorce. The law on this is clear – it is indeed useful for the court to have a view as to the financial circumstances of parties leading up to and following the filing of the divorce: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31610-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 36</a> at [34] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a> at [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I would also add that the Wife cannot side-step her disclosure obligations by simply claiming that she does not have or is unable to produce these statements. She must provide an explanation together with the relevant supporting documents (such as a letter from the bank stating that such records are no longer available): <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [10] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Item 2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> was the Husband’s request for the Wife to provide the following documents of her sole proprietorship (“MD”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Supporting documentation of her business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     IRAS Notice of Assessment for the year 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The basis for the Husband’s request in Item 2 is that there is a massive discrepancy between what the Wife claims that she earns, and what she can afford. According to the Husband, the Wife had declared in her Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that MD was suffering monthly losses to the tune of $7000. Despite this, she had somehow managed to find the money to invest in property in Vietnam and to buy a car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, Mr Teo said that according to the Wife, MD was indeed making a loss. If the Husband claims that MD is making a profit, he had to provide some proof of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s AOM, she states that MD has a deficit of $7094.78, and that she draws a salary (<em>ie</em>, her take-home monthly income) from MD of $3000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In addition, the Wife also states, but provides no further details, that she has a source of income from Vietnam that is not consistent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I note that the Wife has provided nothing by way of documentation in relation to MD. That said, she has provided her IRAS statements for the Year of Assessment in 2022 and 2023. This was her assessed income:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 2022: $11,650</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In 2023: $24,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I observe, solely from what the Wife has disclosed in her AOM, that there does appear to be some discrepancies. For example, if it is true that her monthly take home salary is $3000, her assessed income for tax purposes is markedly lower. In addition to this, the Wife claims, on the one hand, that MD, which is her business, is running a deficit of approximately $7000 every month. Yet on the other, she claims that she has a monthly take-home salary of $3000. It is difficult to see how the figures add up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request and order that the Wife disclose all financial documents relating to MD including, but not limited to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Bank statements;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     MD’s business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Supporting documentation of MD’s business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to allow the Husband, as well as the court, to assess the Wife’s means. This will have a direct bearing on issues such as maintenance. However, I make no order in respect of the Wife’s IRAS statements given that those have already been disclosed in her AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to Item 3.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was a request for the Wife to provide all documents to prove her claimed expenses for MD.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given the extent of the disclosure I have ordered (see above at [21]), I make no order in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I turn now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Husband is seeking documents relating to the two properties that the Wife has in Vietnam. Specifically, the Wife is asked to provide documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Showing the description of the property, the property title and value;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Relating to the sale of the properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As I understood it, the Husband has two main reasons for wanting these documents. First, to determine when these properties were bought. This had a bearing on whether these properties should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets. Second, if these two properties were sold, whether the sales proceeds should be added back into the matrimonial pool. In this vein, the Husband claimed that contributed $80,000 towards acquiring the second property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Mr Teo’s response was that disclosure should not be ordered as these two properties, having been transferred to the Wife’s mother, could not be considered as matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is well established that it is for the court hearing the ancillary matters to decide what constitutes a matrimonial asset. As I had observed in an earlier decision, parties have to strictly observe their disclosure obligations and cannot tailor the extent of their disclosure in accordance with their own views on what constitutes their matrimonial assets: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [81] citing <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [17]. In any event, it cannot be seriously disputed that the documents which the Husband seeks are clearly relevant to the disposal of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 4.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I turn now to the Husband’s request in Item 5<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and 6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Both these requests relate to the Wife’s expenses on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In respect of Item 5, the Husband is asking for documentary evidence of all expenses for A for the last 6 months. During the hearing, the Husband explained that he wanted these documents because the Wife had claimed, as part of her expenses, certain sums spent on A, but had not provided any documents evidencing the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In respect of Item 6, the Husband is asking that the Wife provide the “school fee receipt or statement of payment” to prove that she had paid [X]’s school fees of $740 as she claims to have done in her AOM. The Husband explained that he had proof that he was the one who had paid [X]’s school fees, and that the Wife was simply trying to inflate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In response, Mr Teo explained that in respect of Item 5, the Wife had already disclosed the documents in her AOM. As for Item 6, the Wife’s position was that she no longer had those documents because she would dispose of them once the school term had ended.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The golden rule of litigation, that he or she who asserts must prove their case, applies equally to the hearing of ancillary matters. Any argument that the Wife has not adduced evidence to back up claims made in her AOM is best ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In that connection, the discovery process should not be used as a means of testing the veracity of the other party’s claims (see <em>WYI v WYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31642-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 39</a> at [60]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband’s request in respect of Items 5 and 6 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I come now to the Husband’s request in Item 7.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband wanted the Wife to provide documentary evidence to show that she had paid about $1000 per month for the water and electricity bills. Again, the Husband explained that the Wife had provided no evidence to back up her claims. On the contrary, he claimed to have evidence showing that she did not pay these bills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I disallow the Husband’s request in Item 7. As I have explained above (at [33]), if the Wife claims to have borne certain expenses, she has the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s final request in Item 8<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> was for the Wife to provide documents relating to her business in Vietnam which she says provides her with a source of income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As I had noted above (at [18]), the Wife had not provided any documents relating to this income which she is allegedly receiving from her business in Vietnam. She had also not stated, in her AOM, the amount of money she was receiving from this business in Vietnam. I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 8. These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to ascertaining the Wife’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The twin principles of relevance and necessity also govern when the court will order interrogatories to be answered. In addition, it is also trite law that at this stage, the court is only concerned with the sufficiency of the answers that had been given, and not the <em>truth</em> of those answers (<em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [27] – [30]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The interrogatory framed in Item 1 was a request for the Wife to state her employment history for the past decade (from 2015 to 2024) with relevant details such as the employer name and monthly gross income.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In addition, if the Wife was self-employed during this time, she was also to state the nature of the business and the duration in which she was self-employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     This was the response which the Wife had given in her voluntary response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a husband, the Defendant should know better. The Defendant would be a complete failure if he is not aware of what the Plaintiff is working as.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This is an insufficient answer. The Wife had clearly not answered the interrogatory. She had given a response that was sarcastic and insulting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, Item 1 was clearly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters hearing given what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM. While the Wife had disclosed that she was a beauty technician and had owned MD, she had provided no other details as to what she was working as before she had set up MD, and what other employment she had found after MD had closed down. It would be useful for both the Husband and the court to have a fuller picture of the Wife’s employment history – this was certainly central to assessing her means, and to determine if there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets on her part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The interrogatory framed in Item 2 required the Wife to state details of her business venture in Vietnam – this included, amongst other things, the source of funds used for the business venture.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This interrogatory stems from what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM – that she had an inconsistent source of income from Vietnam.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     This was the Wife’s response:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>A</b>.     <b>Please state the nature of the Business venture in Vietnam:</b> The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam and the Plaintiff would like to claim losses as a result of being his wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>B</b>.     <b>Business start date:</b> The Plaintiff had the Vietnam business from September 2023 to October 2023. The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>C</b>.     <b>Business Participation:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down because as his wife, there was no time to do business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>D</b>.     <b>Business Funding Amount:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down, unless the Defendant agree to pay for the Plaintiff’s losses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>E</b>.     <b>Source of funds for business venture:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>F</b>.     <b>Income statement from business:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply and/or provide the Defendant with documentary evidence as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     It is clear that this response is insufficient. The Wife had not provided the details sought, except to state that the Vietnam business was in operation from September to October 2023. Apart from the fact that her answer was insufficient, it is also plainly provocative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 2. The details of the Wife’s Vietnam business are indeed relevant and necessary to ascertaining her means at the hearing of the ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I come now to Item 3. This was a request for the Wife to state all the properties in which she either owned or had an interest in, and to provide details of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff did not know which properties the Defendant were talking about.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This is not, in my judgment, a sufficient answer. The interrogatory, as it is framed, is capable of either a positive or a negative answer. It is not sufficient to claim ignorance as to which properties the Husband is referring to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 3. I am satisfied that the interrogatory is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – specifically, determining which assets fell into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I come now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The manner in which this interrogatory was framed suggested that the Husband was asking for the Wife’s monthly bank account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     During the hearing, the Husband clarified that he was actually asking the Wife to state the amounts in her bank account from February 2023 to February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had already provided the bank statement for her 3 banks account in Singapore, for appropriate care and upbringing given to son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that I had allowed the Husband’s request for the Wife to disclose her bank statements (see [13] above), I do not think that this interrogatory is necessary. The Husband’s request in respect of Item 4 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In summary, these are the orders which I make in respect of SUM 1204:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the documents listed at paragraphs 3, 4, 6, and 10<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her possession, custody or power, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall answer the interrogatories as set out at paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by 28 August 2024. Cost submissions for SUM 1204 are to be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of three pages each. This should be done no later than 28 August 2024. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I must emphasise that the interrogatory process is not an opportunity for a party to hurl snide remarks. The manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories was completely unnecessary and only served to risk aggravating matters between the parties (see above at [41] and [46]). Such behaviour is unacceptable in our family justice system. To that end, parties are to, in their submissions on costs, address me on whether any costs ordered should also take into account the manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories that had been put to her.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 3(c) on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>As set out at para 3(c) of the Wife’s AOM on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at p 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at pp 8 and 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>These have been referred to in this judgment as Items 1, 2, 4, and 8.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents belonging to a third party","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories – Sufficiency of answer"],"date":"2024-08-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2161 of 2023 (Summons No 1650, 1651, 1687 and 1688 of 2024)","title":"XAY v XAZ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 60","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31974-SSP.xml","counsel":["Tan Jin Song, Deborah Ng Wan Yun and Connie Kuan (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Chew Wei En (Teoh & Co LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XAY v XAZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAY <em>v</em> XAZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 60</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

As to what is “relevant”, the cases state that what is relevant in the context of family cases is very wide – this ensures the proper delineation of issues and that all the necessary evidence is placed before the judge hearing the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [23] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although there were 9 items as set out in the annex to SUM 1650, Mr Tan confirmed during the hearing that the Husband was not proceeding with his request in respect of Item 9. I turn now to deal with the rest of the items.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I shall deal with Items 1 and 2 together. Item 1 was a request for the consolidated statements for the Wife’s bank accounts for the period February 2023 to February 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS Savings Account No. ending -48; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     DBS Unit trusts Account No ending -10.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Mr Tan explained that the Wife had only provided her bank statements from January 2023 to November 2023, and that she did not provide her statements from December 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan also highlighted that on 20 October 2023, the Wife had withdrawn the sums of $50,000 and $69,000 from her account. The bank statements which the Husband sought were therefore relevant and necessary to ascertain if the Wife had made other similarly large withdrawals from her account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 2 was a request for the bank statements for the Wife’s UOB Stash account ending -0-0 for the period February 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan explained that while the Wife had disclosed her statements from June 2023 to October 2023, she did not provide her statements from November 2023 to February 2024, nor did she explain why she had not done so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Mr Chew’s response in relation to Items 1 and 2 was that it was a mere fishing expedition. There was no need for these documents to be disclosed because it was well-established law that the court ascertains the pool of matrimonial assets as of the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     While it is true that the court should generally rely on the date of the interim judgment as the starting point in determining the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>WXW v WXX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31651-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 24</a>), this is not a rule cast in stone. The court can depart from this starting point: see <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [26] (see also <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [31]; <em>TQU v TQT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24198-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 8</a> at [35] – [38]). There was, therefore, no basis to refuse disclosure on the basis that the documents were irrelevant as the pool of matrimonial assets was ascertained as at the date of interim judgment, and these statements related to a period <em>after</em> interim judgment had been granted. The judge hearing the ancillary matters is well entitled to choose an operative date, after the grant of the interim judgment, to ascertain the pool of matrimonial assets. To that end, the documents which the Husband seeks are certainly relevant and necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the circumstances, I will allow the Husband’s request in Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Item 3 was a request for documents setting out the Wife’s CPF contribution history showing the parties which had contributed to her CPF account, the amounts contributed, and the dates of these contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As Mr Tan explained, these documents were relevant and necessary to establishing whether the Wife had been employed in Singapore. This was because the Wife does not dispute, on the one hand, that she received CPF contributions. Yet, on the other, the Wife also states that she had never been employed in Singapore. The Wife’s position was that money had been deposited in her CPF account because she had allowed the Husband’s current partner to “use her name as an employee to reach certain quotas”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Although the Wife had disclosed her income tax statements and CPF statements, Mr Tan argued that this was not enough. The Husband wanted documents showing specific details relating to the amounts that had been contributed to the Wife’s CPF account – these documents went towards the issue of whether any adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife, and the extent of such an adverse inference that should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, Mr Chew argued that these documents were not necessary or relevant because the Wife had already given her income tax statements which clearly showed that she did not have to pay taxes in the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Given the extent of the Wife’s disclosure, there was, according to Mr Chew, no further need to allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife had indeed, in her reply affidavit, produced her CPF statements from 2016 – 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> However, the statements which were disclosed only provided a summary of the transactions in the entire year. For example, in 2016, the Wife’s CPF statements disclose that a total of $4236.53 had been contributed to her CPF accounts. The statement further discloses that either herself or her employer had contributed some $4070. What the statement does not show, however, is <em>who</em> had made that contribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 3. In addition, I also order the Wife to disclose any payslips that she may have, or be able to obtain. If she cannot produce her payslips, she must provide an explanation along with any supporting documents. I deem it fit to make such an additional order because it appears, from her CPF statements, that she had received employer contributions to her CPF accounts – and if this is indeed the case, it is also likely that there would be a payslip providing the breakdown of her salary including the contributions to her CPF made by her employer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Item 4 was a request for statements from the Wife’s CDP, investment, and trading accounts for the period February 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan highlighted that the documents showed that on 19 January 2023, the Wife had received a sum of approximately $68,000 from her stock-broker. Given that this had taken place in the months leading up to the grant of the interim judgment, it raised the suspicion that the Wife was dissipating assets which rightfully belonged to the matrimonial pool. These statements were therefore relevant and necessary to determining whether there was indeed any dissipation of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In response, Mr Chew argued that the Wife was not the one who had filed the divorce – it therefore could not be alleged that she was dissipating assets in anticipation of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I could not agree with Mr Chew’s argument. The cases make it clear that it is useful for the court to have a snapshot of the parties’ financial situation in the months leading up to the breakdown of their marriage and the filing of the divorce: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31610-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 36</a> at [34] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a> at [9]. It matters very little as to which party had fired the first shot in filing for the divorce. For example, the defendant to a divorce suit may well have, in sensing that the writing was on the wall and that divorce proceedings were imminent, taken steps to put their assets out of reach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 4.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Item 5 was a request for documents showing the amounts the Wife had received from lending her name to various friends and other people to set up companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband had asked for these documents because in the Wife’s Affidavit of Asset and Means (“AOM”), she had stated:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Apart from the online work I was doing, in order to supplement our income, I would also lend my name to various friends and other people, who needed to use my name to set up companies. This includes the [Husband] and the company known as [MX] was one such instance. The [Husband] wanted to start a side business while remaining employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The documents provided by the Wife, however, painted a different picture. The Husband points to two emails disclosed by the Wife. These emails are written by two separate individuals, [“XL”] and [“HS”]. Both emails state that they had used the Wife’s name to set up their company, but they had never given her any money for this – the Wife had helped them out as they were friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife claimed that she had already provided all the documents she had – if the Husband was dissatisfied, this was a matter to be raised in submissions at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 5. I note that parties do not dispute either the relevance or necessity of these documents. Rather, their quarrel centres over whether the Wife had indeed produced all the relevant documentation. In that vein, I add that the Wife cannot sidestep her disclosure obligations by claiming, without more, that she does not have the documents. She must, minimally, furnish an explanation as to why she cannot produce the documents along with any relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Item 6 was a request for the annual financial statements for the Wife’s businesses in China from 2016 – 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Mr Tan argued that the Wife should provide the relevant documents to substantiate her claim that she had earned about SGD 1 million and used it to purchase 2 commercial properties during the marriage as she had alleged at paragraph 16(h) of her first AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Mr Chew stated that the Wife did not have any documents and thus was unable to provide disclosure of the same. To be clear, Mr Chew did not dispute that there were no such documents in existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     During the hearing, I had asked Mr Tan why the Husband wanted these documents. After all, if the Wife had claimed that she had used her profits from her company to purchase two commercial properties, but had not provided proof of the same, that was to her detriment. Mr Tan explained that the documents were also needed to determine if there was anything else that the Wife had yet to disclose. Mr Tan also argued that without these documents, it was impossible to ascertain how much the Wife had earnt from her business in China, let alone begin to frame any submissions on any adverse inferences that should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I agree with these points made by Mr Tan. Leaving aside the general principle that the party who asserts must prove their case, I am of the view that these documents were certainly relevant to the issue of whether any adverse inference should be drawn as well as ascertaining the Wife’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I come now to Item 7. This was a request for documents showing the monthly income received by the Wife’s rental property in China including, but not limited to, the tenancy agreements as well as bank statements to show the rental income received.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     There was some dispute, at the hearing, as to whether the Husband was going beyond his original request for documents for the period February 2023 to date. Mr Tan clarified that what the Husband was simply asking for was that if the Wife took the position that she was unable to disclose these documents, she should provide an explanation including any supporting documents (<em>eg</em>, documents showing that the tenancy had ended prior to February 2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 7. The documents sought were relevant and necessary to establishing the Wife’s means – it had a direct bearing on issues such as maintenance. I note that the Wife claimed that she had already complied with the Husband’s original request as there was no rental from February 2023 onwards.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> However, as Mr Tan rightly points out, if the Wife does not have these documents, she must provide an explanation along with any relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Item 8 was a request for documents to show the current valuation of the Wife’s rental property in China. Mr Tan argued that all the Wife had provided in relation to the valuation of this property was the screenshot of a text message from a person purporting to be the agent that had helped the Wife purchase the property. The message said that the Wife would receive 270,000 yuan if the property was sold.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan argued that this was insufficient disclosure – if she had purchased the property, there must be some documents evidencing that transaction. These documents would also disclose the value of the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In response, Mr Chew argued that any dispute as to the valuation of the property was a matter for submissions and should not be tested in the discovery process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While disputes as to the valuation of the property are, as Mr Chew rightly points out, a matter best left for submissions, there must be some evidential basis for the parties to dispute the valuation of the property. Simply put, there must be certain documents showing, <em>inter alia</em>, how the value of the property was derived. This would include documents which form part of the paper trail created in property transactions: for instance, bank loans which had been taken out or an option to purchase. In this connection, I agreed with Mr Tan that there was simply insufficient disclosure on the Wife’s part in the present case. This text message alone was simply not enough.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 8. The Wife shall disclose any documents that shed light on the valuation of the China property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1651 – The Husband’s Application for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is trite law that the twin principles of relevance and necessity govern when interrogatories are ordered. One other consideration that must be taken into account is whether the answer which had been provided is sufficient, and not whether the answer which had been provided was true. The truth of any of the answers is a matter to be determined by the judge hearing the ancillary matters. These are the principles which I apply to both SUM 1651 and SUM 1688. I note, at the outset, that parties did not dispute the relevance or necessity of these interrogatories – rather, the main dispute centred on the sufficiency of the answer which had been provided by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This was the interrogatory posed in Item 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please state the source(s) of contributions to your CPF accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     This was the answer which the Wife had provided:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The contributions are made by companies who had used our client’s name as an employee. Our client received no income other than the CPF contributions that were made by these companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     This was, in my judgment, not a sufficient answer. The interrogatory posed had asked the Wife to state the source(s) of contributions to her CPF account. While the interrogatory could perhaps have been framed with more precision, for example, by asking the Wife to list all the entities that had contributed to her CPF account, it was apparent to me that this was exactly the intent of the interrogatory which had been posed. It was insufficient for the Wife to merely state, without going into detail, that she was receiving payment from certain companies which had used her name as an employee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 1 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I turn now to Item 2. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to the allegation that apart from the online work that you were doing, in order to supplement your income, you also lent your name to various friends and other people, who needed to use your name to set up companies, please state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The names of the people and the businesses that you have lent your name to, the dates of incorporation of the companies and the names and UEN of the companies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    The income that you received for each of the business(es) that you lent your name to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     One part of the answer which the Wife had provided in her response dated 25 April 2024 contained a formatting error. The Wife’s amended response to clarify that part of her answer was provided in an email from her lawyers dated 23 May 2024. For ease of analysis, the Wife’s response to Item 2 is reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The names of the friends are [XL] and [HS]. The names of the companies are [CD] and .[SLE]. The Plaintiff is aware of the UEN number and incorporation dates as the ACRA profile of these companies are already provided earlier. The Defendant does not recall the dates and the UEN numbers in any event.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    The Defendant only received about $400 (ex gratia payment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was clear to me that the Wife’s response in respect of Item 2(a) was sufficient. She had answered every part of the interrogatory, and disclosed the names of her friends and corporate entities that she had lent her name to. That said, I make no comment as to the <em>truth</em> of the answer provided – this is a matter to be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As for the Wife’s response in respect of Item 2(b), that was, in my judgment, an insufficient answer. The interrogatory as framed in Item 2(b) had specifically asked the Wife to state the income for <em>each</em> of the businesses that she had lent her name to. The Wife had not done this. As a consequence, it is unclear whether she had received $400 from <em>each</em> of the corporate entities she had named, or whether she had received $400 in total. In that vein, I would go further to add that an unclear or ambiguous answer cannot be considered a sufficient answer to an interrogatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 2(b) is allowed. His request in Item 2(a) is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I turn now to Item 3. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to your China business that was set up sometime in 2016 and involved the buying and selling of cars as well as an internet business, please state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    details of the “internet business”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if you incorporated the business(es) in China;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    your capital for the business(es) and the source for the same;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the amount you earned from the business(es) from the time it was incorporated until the time the business “folded”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    the exact date on which the business(es) “folded”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The name of the company was [ST].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Yes. The Defendant was a franchisee from a major internet business company in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    It was from the Defendant’s savings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    The Defendant does not recall the same but estimates that it was more than S$1 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)    17 September 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     While the Husband is perfectly entitled to dispute the truth of the Wife’s response, there can be, in my judgment, no dispute as to the sufficiency of the answer. It is clear that the Wife had answered each and every part of the interrogatory posed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 3 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1687 – The Wife’s Application for Discovery </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1687.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Item 1 was a request for the Husband’s CDP statements for the years 2017 – 2021. Mr Chew explained that the statements were needed to piece together the value of any shares which the Husband had in his CDP account. In response, Mr Tan said that the Husband did not have any of these statements. Mr Tan also argued that the period of disclosure sought was too wide as it covered the period prior to the breakdown of the marriage and the filing of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Insofar as the period of disclosure is concerned, given the threadbare details provided in the Statement of Particulars, it is difficult to say with any measure of certainty when the marriage had begun to break down. What has been stated, however, is that parties had begun to sleep in separate bedrooms sometime around March 2019. In light of this, I do not think that the period of disclosure sought is an unreasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 1. If the Husband is unable to produce these documents, he must provide an explanation along with any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Item 2 was a request for the Husband to produce the statements for the years 2017 – 2021 for the following bank accounts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS account ending xx-7</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     DBS account ending xx-1</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>(c)     DBS account ending xx-0; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>(d)     HSBC Advance Account ending -xx2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As Mr Chew explained, the Wife was seeking discovery of these bank statements for an extended period because the Husband had stated, on the one hand, that his salary was very low, yet on the other, he was able to make payment of some $600,000 towards the mortgage. These bank statements were therefore relevant and necessary towards ascertaining the true extent of the Husband’s financial means and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Mr Tan’s response was that the Husband had already disclosed his source of funds at para 15.6 of the Husband’s first AOM:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The current value of the Matrimonial Property is S$1,660,000.00 (Annex 6) and the loan left is S$66,366.43 (Annex 5). The nett value is therefore approximately S$1,593,633.57. I also wish to say that if I depended on my salary alone, that would be insufficient for all this payment and the family’s expenses over the years. I had actually worked as much overtime as I could, and if I could not (due to limited hours) I would find odd jobs and work on the side. Due to my skills, I did manage to save up for all this expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Mr Tan also argued that insofar as the Wife might harbour suspicions that the Husband had dissipated assets which rightfully belonged to the matrimonial pool, there was simply no such evidence that could give rise or lend credence to such suspicions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I note that the Husband had produced, in his reply affidavit to SUM 1687, an email from HSBC stating that the partial redemption of $531,000 had taken place on 15<sup>th</sup> November 2016. According to the Husband, he had managed to come up with this amount, notwithstanding his low salary, from all the side income he had earnt from doing odd-jobs. There are, however, no details in his first AOM, as to how much income he had derived from these odd-jobs, and no supporting documents to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in Item 2. In addition to this, I will also order that the Husband is to disclose any bank statements that he may have, or that he may be able to obtain from January 2010 to December 2016. If the Husband is unable to produce these bank statements, he must provide an explanation, as well as documents in support (<em>eg</em>, a response from the bank stating that the account statements are no longer available due to the passage of time).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In my judgment, these documents are certainly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. They would allow the court to determine whether the Husband had indeed made full and frank disclosure of his financial means and resources. These documents would also shed light on whether there indeed any other assets belonging to the Husband which have yet to be disclosed, and also allow the Wife to ascertain the Husband’s means from the comings and goings of his bank accounts. I have also ordered a wider period of disclosure than what the Wife had sought because, having read the Husband’s first AOM, it appeared to me that the bank statements from 2010 to 2016 were also necessary to piecing together how the Husband had managed to not only pay off a sum of almost $500,000 towards the mortgage, but also the sum of approximately $90,000 towards his life insurance premium (see below at [76]) <em>despite</em> claiming to draw a salary of $2000 – $3000 and doing some odd jobs on the side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Item 3 was a request for the Husband to show cash payments that he had made towards the matrimonial home including, but not limited to, the HSBC mortgage loan. Given that I have allowed the Wife’s request in respect of Item 2, I make no order in relation to Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Item 4 was a request for documents to show how much the Husband had earnt including the odd jobs and work that he had done on the side. It is clear why the Wife had made this request – the Husband had declared that he paid down the mortgage with his earnings from his side income. The Wife thus wanted documents to ascertain the true extent of the Husband’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Mr Tan argued that the Wife’s request should not be allowed. He argued that if the Wife took the position that the Husband was indeed richer than he had disclosed, that was a matter to be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. There was, in any event, sufficient evidence on record to show the Husband’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I will allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. As I have explained above (at [64]), it is unclear how the Husband managed to put together the financial resources to pay off the mortgage as well as his life insurance premiums. Although I had also ordered the Husband to disclose his bank statements from January 2010 to December 2016, the bank statements may not give the full scope of the work the Husband had engaged in on the side. The Husband could well have received payments in cold hard cash for the odd jobs that he had done. The scope of the Wife’s request in Item 4 goes beyond bank statements and includes documents such as invoices and payslips. These documents, together with the Husband’s bank statements, would paint a fuller picture of the Husband’s financial means. It goes without saying, therefore, that these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I shall deal with Items 5 and 6 together. This was the Wife’s request for source documents (such as statements, valuation reports, company resolutions etc) to support various details that had been listed in the financial statement of MX the financial years 2022 and 2023 respectively. During the hearing, Mr Chew clarified that the Wife was not proceeding with her request for the documents showing the increase in the amounts owed to third parties as the Husband had provided the relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As to why Items 5 and 6 were relevant and necessary, Mr Chew explained that the source documents were needed to ascertain the legitimacy of the loans which MX had taken out. This was because the value of MX, according to the Husband, was effectively zero – the value of the properties it owned was cancelled out by its debt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Mr Tan’s response was that MX was an exempt private company and, as such, was not required to file financial statements. According to an ACRA statement which the Husband had disclosed, MX had not filed any financial statements in the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan also emphasised that while the Husband did produce some company documents, this did not mean that he would be able to produce the rest of the company documents sought. This was because the Husband was only a 50% shareholder, and one of two directors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As a matter of strict formal logic, there is much force to Mr Tan’s argument that just because the Husband could produce <em>some</em> of the company documents, this did not necessarily mean that he could produce <em>all</em> of the company documents. The point which Mr Chew made, however, as I understood it, was that because the Husband was able to produce <em>some</em> of the company documents, the inference to be drawn is that these documents were in indeed his power, custody or possession such that disclosure should be ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I agree with Mr Chew’s point. I would also add that these documents were certainly relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters – they would shed light on the valuation of MX, and also allow the court to determine whether any adverse inferences should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 5 and 6 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Item 7 was the Wife’s request for documents to prove the source of funds used to pay for the Husband’s life insurance policy. As Mr Chew explained during the course of the hearing, the Wife wanted the documents to ascertain how the Husband had been able to afford the premium for this policy given his income. In other words, as I understood Mr Chew’s argument, the Wife wanted these documents to ascertain if the Husband indeed had deeper pockets than he had declared in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, and if so, how deep those pockets were.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Husband had disclosed some details relating to this policy in his first AOM. The surrender value of the policy comes in at $106,814.48. The documents also show that the Husband had made a single cash payment towards the premium.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It also bears noting that the Husband himself had declared, in his first AOM, that his salary in 2011 was SGD $2706 and his salary in 2013 was SGD $3000. The Husband also recounts that in June 2013, he had very reluctantly, “bitten the bullet” and acceded to his Wife’s demands to purchase the matrimonial home:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…Based on what I could find, my salary was only S$2,706 in 2011 (Annex 22). My salary would have been around S$3,000 in 2013 from my recollection. I knew clearly that purchasing the property would be a heavy burden given my salary. However, I thought of the children and as I was still young, I bit the bullet and purchased the Home, since the mortgage payments would only commence in 4 years. The purchase price was S$1,007,160 and the loan was S$705,000. As explained in paragraph 15.2 above, the downpayment was paid by me alone. If I knew that the Defendant would turn back on her word to sell the property, I would have never agreed to buy it…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Given what the Husband had disclosed, the documents which the Wife seeks are indeed relevant and necessary in two ways. First, they would allow the Wife, as well as the court, to assess whether the Husband had indeed made full and frank disclosure of his income and assets. Second, these documents could well reveal whether the Husband had <em>other</em> assets which he had yet to disclose. Although I had ordered the Husband to disclose his bank statements from 2010 onwards (see above at [63]), it could well be the case that the bank statements would not disclose the source of funds which the Husband had used to pay the premiums on his life insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I shall deal with the final two items (8 and 9) together. This was the Wife’s request for documents evidencing loans of about $1 million and $464,000 which both Mr B, as well as the Husband, had made to MX. Specifically, these were the requests the Wife had made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 8: documents such as MX’s bank statements as well as Mr B’s bank statements to demonstrate that $1,090,000 was owed to Mr B as of 31 March 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 9: documents such as MX’s bank statements as well as the Husband’s bank statements to demonstrate that $464,811 was owed to the Husband as of 31 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     Mr Tan argued that disclosure should not be ordered – the issue of whether the loans which had been made to MX were legitimate was, properly speaking, a matter for submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Insofar as Item 8 was concerned, it appeared that the Wife was essentially seeking discovery against a third party. Mr Chew clarified that this was not the case – rather, because the Husband had produced Mr B’s bank statements, this suggested that these bank statements were indeed within his possession, custody or power such that the Husband could be ordered to produce them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Mr Tan countered that the Wife’s request in respect of Item 8 was, in substance, an application for discovery against a third party. Given that Mr B was a non-party to the present action, the proper thing to do was for the Wife to take out an application for discovery against a third party (see Rule 71 of the Family Justice Rules 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The obligation of a party to give discovery extends to documents which are, or have been, in their possession, custody or power. This is enshrined in Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. The definition of the terms “possession”, “custody” or “power” are neatly encapsulated by the learned authors in Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, Family Procedure in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [63.03]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Possession” refers to both a physical holding of and possessory right over the document; “custody” refers to the physical possession but not the legal rights over the document and “power” refers to an enforceable legal right over the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The commentary provided in the White Book is also relevant (<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 vol 1</em> (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“White Book”) at [24/1/4]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power” (r.1(1))—</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">This rule in effect embodies the practice and decisions under the former O.31 in the U.K. in regard to discovery of documents. Under that Order a distinction was made (following the old Chancery practice) between the obligation to make discovery of documents and the obligation to produce documents for inspection. There was an obligation to disclose documents which were or had been in the deponent’s possession or power and in which he had a joint property with other persons or no property at all, and also, semble, documents which were or had been in his mere custody (Bray, p. 225); there was no obligation to produce them for inspection (see Edward Bray, <em>The Principles and Practice of Discovery</em> (London: Reeves and Turner, 1885), pp. 196–209, 224–227). <b>The word “custody”, included in the present rule, makes clear that the party is under a duty to disclose documents belonging to others of which he has (or has had) mere custody.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Accordingly the party must disclose under an order made under this rule (and the court has power to order him to do so under r.3(1)) the following classes of documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    Documents that are or have been in his possession. Possession is distinguished from mere corporeal holding, i.e. custody. A bailee or agent has possession of documents entrusted to him for the owner; a servant, who has no legal right to possession, as such has merely custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Documents that are or have been in his custody. Therefore documents of a limited company, held by an employee or director ordered to make discovery, are included in one or other of these two classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    Documents that are or have been in his power. These include all documents which, though they are not in his possession or custody, he has an enforceable legal right to obtain from the person who has them (see discussion in <em>Anthony Wee Soon Kim v. UBS AG</em> [2002] S.G.H.C. 206, affirming <em>Lonrho Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/14132-E-M.xml')\">[1980] 1 W.L.R. 627</a>), e.g. where he is the owner and has not parted with the right to possession. It follows that the words include also:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)    Documents which are or have been in the possession, custody or power of any agent for him (see <em>Murray v. Walter</em> (1839) Cr. &amp; Ph. 114 at 125; <em>Swanston v. Lishman</em> (1881) 45 L.T. 360; <em>Mertens v. Haigh</em> (1863) 3 De G. J. &amp; S. 328; <em>Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Co. of Europe Ltd. v. Orion Marine Insurance Underwriting Agency Ltd.</em> [1995] Q.B. 174; [1995] 3 All E.R. 211 (continuing entitlement in principal after termination of agency in absence of express exclusion to the contrary to documents relating to acts done in his name during agency)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)    Documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power jointly with or as agent or servant of some other person (see cases cited under (a) above and <em>Taylor v. Rundell</em> (1841) Cr. &amp; Ph. 104; <em>Bovill v. Cowan</em> (1870) L.R. 5 Ch. 495).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     It is therefore clear that a respondent to a discovery application can be ordered to disclose documents belonging to a third party if those documents have been in his custody. In determining whether these documents have been in the respondent’s custody, it is relevant to consider factors such as the relationship between the respondent and the third party to which the documents belong as well as the nature of the documents in respect of which disclosure is sought. If the evidence discloses that the respondent has had access to the third party’s documents – that too is a highly relevant factor (see e.g.: <em>Sterilab &amp; Santé Global v Secretary of State for Health</em> [2024] EWHC 1708 (TCC) at [7] and [21] citing <em>Public Institution for Social Security v Al Wazzan</em> [2024] EWHC 480 (Comm) at [28] and <em>Berkeley Square Holdings Limited v Lancer Property Asset Management Limited</em> [2021] EWHC 849 (Ch) at [46])).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Returning to the present case, it was apparent to me that Mr B had a close business relationship with the Husband. Several pieces of evidence point me to this conclusion. For one, the Husband had recounted in his first AOM the extent of his business dealings with Mr B.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It is also worth noting that Mr B is the joint shareholder-director of MX alongside the Husband. In addition to this, the Husband had also disclosed, in his first AOM, Mr B’s bank account statements with specific transactions highlighted to show that Mr B had paid the Wife $590,000 to acquire her shares in MX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     That being said, the documents which the Wife seeks are Mr B’s personal bank statements. Even accounting for the supposedly close relationship between the Husband and Mr B, I do not think it likely that the Husband would have had custody of Mr B’s bank statements showing the loan of $1,090,000 made to MX. While the Husband did produce Mr B’s bank statements in his first AOM, I consider that he was able to do so because he had, in all likelihood, asked Mr B for help. This, however, does not mean that the Husband has had custody of <em>all</em> of Mr B’s bank statements – these are, after all, documents of a highly sensitive and personal nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The proper thing to do, therefore, was to take out an application for discovery against a third-party pursuant to Rule 71 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. Insofar as the Wife sought disclosure of Mr B’s bank statements in Item 8 – that request is, therefore, disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     That being said, I was of the view that the documents sought in Items 8 and 9 were certainly relevant and necessary given that they would cast light on the legitimacy of the loans made to MX by the Husband and Mr B. This has a direct bearing on the valuation of assets to be included in the matrimonial pool (assuming, of course, that the Husband’s shares in MX are eventually included in that pool). The Wife’s request in respect of Item 9 is therefore allowed. As for Item 8, while I disallow the Wife’s request, I will instead order that the Husband disclose documents showing that MX had received the sum of $1,090,000 from Mr B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1688 – The Wife’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     I deal first with the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 2. This was the interrogatory posed in Item 1 of the Wife’s application:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to particularise his employment history throughout the marriage, including but not limited to fully particularising “all odd jobs and work on the side” that he has allegedly done. This shall include details such as what was the job, number of hours spent on the job, remuneration of the job, how he was paid and where the monies from such “odd jobs and work on the side” were deposited into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This was the Wife’s request in Item 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state particularise his total income earned during the marriage, including but not limited to his employment income with [FG] and ‘odd jobs and work on the side’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Husband had objected to answering both these interrogatories in his response on the basis that it was not relevant, and in any event, he had provided the details which the Wife sought in his first AOM. The Husband also objected to this request on the basis that it was vexatious and oppressive. In response to the Wife’s claims that this interrogatory was relevant to ascertain the Husband’s claim that he was the main financial contributor to the family, the Husband also said, in his response, that the Wife did not, in any event, allege that she had made any contributions during the marriage, and she had in fact claimed that she was unemployed since 2007.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     This was what the Husband had said in his first AOM in relation to the odd jobs he had worked:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.9  As mentioned above, in May 2008, parties purchased their first matrimonial property at 899B Woodlands Drive 50. Since the Defendant did not have her own income or much savings, most if not all of the funds came from the monies I saved and sent to her. During this period, I often went to the supermarket to purchase groceries after work and cooked for the family after returning home. <b>After dinner, I will take out my tools and start doing repairs for people to earn some side income.</b> I have never slept before midnight, and it was common that I had to stay up until 1am or 2am. My health has been greatly affected and I am no longer able to work like that now sadly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Apart from this mention of doing repairs to earn some side income, the Husband provides no further details in his first AOM. He does not disclose how much he had made from these side gigs, nor has he provided details as to how long he continued to do these side gigs and where the money from these side gigs had gone to. I also add that while the Husband does disclose his <em>current</em> salary and make passing reference to how his salary had increased over the years, he does not really set out sufficient detail to piece together the total income he had earnt over the course of the marriage. The Husband also makes no mention of any salary he had earnt from [FG].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     In short, the Husband’s reference to his AOM cannot be, in my judgment, considered a sufficient answer to the Wife’s interrogatory as set out in Items 1 and 2. I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request in Item 3:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to particularise all the transfers made by him to pay down the mortgage loan for the matrimonial home between 2017 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Wife had explained that this interrogatory was relevant to ascertaining parties’ contributions towards the matrimonial assets. The Husband, in his response, objected to answering this interrogatory on the basis that it was irrelevant, vexatious and oppressive, and that the Wife had, in any event, not claimed that she had made contributions towards the matrimonial property. The Husband also pointed out that the Wife had claimed that she had been unemployed since 2007.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3. It was not relevant, or necessary for the Husband to particularise all the transfers made by him to pay down the mortgage. What mattered more towards assessing his contributions towards the matrimonial assets was the total amount he had contributed to paying down the mortgage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     I come now to the Wife’s request in Item 4:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state and particularise the source of funds that he used to fund the various cheques that he wrote for the purchase of the 2 commercial properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Husband responded by referring to paragraph 16.13 of his first AOM. This was what he had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Between 2015 to 2018, the Defendant spent most of her time in China, claiming to have found good investment and business opportunities, and that she even set up a company and a shop with someone. After she returned to Singapore, she took away the savings which I had in the bank and borrowed some money from our mutual acquaintance, Mr B. She also requested that I send her my remaining savings. I obliged as I did not want to argue with her. As such, on 27 November 2016, I transferred S$125,651.00 to her (Annex 23) and on 13 April 2017, I transferred S$300,000.00 to her (from the cash sales proceeds of S$308,933.67 from the sale of the first matrimonial home) (Annex 24) for a total of more than S$425,000.00. The Defendant also took some money from a Maybank account. However, as the account was closed too long ago, I am no longer able to retrieve the records. All the money which I sent/gave the Defendant over the years was what I painstakingly saved by being frugal and working overtime. To clarify, the Defendant later transferred the following sums back to me on the dates as shown but they only add up to S$392,340.00: S$150,000 on 18 December 2017, S$142,741.94 on 21 December 2017 and S$99,597.59 on 25 December 2017.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    It is clear to me, having read this paragraph, that the Husband’s response is insufficient. The interrogatory asks the Husband to state and particularise his source of funds. In essence, the Wife wants the details of how he funded the two cheques for the purchase of the commercial properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> While the Husband had referred to paragraph 16.13 of his first AOM, this paragraph does not clearly disclose the details of his source of funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The Wife’s request in respect of Item 4 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I come now to the Wife’s final request in Item 5:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state the total amount of monies paid for legal fees prior to the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    The Husband had, in his response, objected to answering this interrogatory on the basis that it was a matter of legal privilege. At the hearing, Mr Tan argued that there was no practical purpose to this interrogatory. In response, Mr Chew argued that while one could indeed claim privilege in answering an interrogatory, and that this would be considered a sufficient answer (see Rule 70(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014), the Wife’s position was that costs were not covered by legal privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I disallow the request. This interrogatory was not relevant or necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. This is because the approach which courts have generally taken to legal costs of matrimonial proceedings is that parties should settle their own legal costs out of their own share of the matrimonial assets after division, and that legal costs should not be taken out of the matrimonial pool: <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25220-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 109</a> at [45] citing <em>UFU (M.W.) v UFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20826-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 23</a> at [105] citing <em>AQT v AQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0138.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 138</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    In summary, these are the orders made in respect of the four applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>SUM 1650 (Husband’s Application for Discovery)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of Items 1 – 8 of Annex A annexed to SUM 1650, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In addition, the Wife shall also disclose the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Any payslips that she may have, or be able to obtain (see above at [18]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power.

The Will further contained an express provision as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot; I DO NOT wish to give any of my property or personal properties to my wife, Mdm [Plaintiff] (Passport No. xxx) as I merely 'marry' her to help her extend her stay as an accompanying person to her child who is studying in Singapore. We are unable to consummate our marriage.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The deceased passed away on 2 September 2015 and grant of probate for his estate was subsequently issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 26 January 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 30 June 2017, the Plaintiff commenced the present probate action to revoke the grant issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the basis that the Will is invalid due to the following<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the deceased was not of sound mind and memory and was unable to understand the nature of signing and executing the Will, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     in the alternative, that the signature of the Deceased was a forgery, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     in the alternative, that the Will was prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of “someone or some people”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Plaintiff further sought for letters of administration for the estate of the deceased to be granted to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Defendants denied the Plaintiff’s claim on the basis that they were bare allegations and asserted that the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity and had executed the Will of his own accord.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the evidence and the submissions made by the Plaintiff and counsel for the Defendants, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim as I found that her allegations were bare allegations, unsubstantiated by the evidence and granted order in terms of the Defendants’ counterclaim. Dissatisfied, the Plaintiff now appeals against the whole of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Plaintiff is a Chinese national. She came to Singapore to accompany her daughter who was studying here. She first knew the Deceased in 2011 as his tenant and remained his tenant, until their marriage. The deceased was a bachelor who lived in a 3-room flat at Whampoa Drive, which he owned in his sole name. The flat had two bedrooms and a utility room. As he was a retiree, the deceased relied solely on the rental from the rooms of the flat for his income. Apart from his siblings, he did not have any other immediate family members as his parents were deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Plaintiff and the deceased subsequently married on 16 October 2013. They had a simple solemnization ceremony conducted in the living room of the deceased’s flat. The solemnization was attended only by the Plaintiff’s friend and the friend’s husband who acted as witnesses for the marriage. The deceased did not invite any of his siblings, other relatives or friends to the wedding. When asked by the Plaintiff why the deceased did not invite his siblings, the deceased simply replied that he and the Plaintiff would not have been able to proceed with the marriage if he did.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> After the marriage, the deceased continued to reside with the Plaintiff at the said flat at Whampoa Drive until about a month before his demise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Sometime, on xx October 2014, the Plaintiff and the deceased were interviewed by reporters from a local Chinese newspaper (“the Chinese newspaper”) on their marriage. Soon after, in October 2014, a newspaper article was published in the Chinese newspaper <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> on the marriage between the Plaintiff and the deceased being a sham marriage, which distressed the Plaintiff greatly. According to the newspaper article, after the marriage, the deceased and the Plaintiff slept separately without consummation of the marriage. It further stated that, as the Plaintiff ceased to pay rent to the deceased after the marriage, the deceased sought to divorce the Plaintiff but the Plaintiff refused. When interviewed, the Plaintiff denied that the deceased ever raised the issue of divorce and questioned why she needed to pay rent when they were already married.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     After the publication of the newspaper article, both the Plaintiff and the deceased continued to reside at the flat but the Plaintiff started paying the deceased $400 per month in November and December 2014. In return, the deceased issued the Plaintiff signed receipts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> certifying that he had received payment of $400 from the Plaintiff as “payment for the water and electricity bill, taxes and other miscellaneous charges”. The receipt further stated that “[the Plaintiff] is responsible for the daily living activities of [the deceased], including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene and accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 18 December 2014, the deceased signed a letter authorizing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the Plaintiff to put up one of the rooms in the flat for rent. The document further stated that the deceased and the Plaintiff agreed that the Plaintiff shall:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     be responsible for all matters relating to the room rental,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     bear all expenses related to the repairs, renovations, interior decorations and additional furniture and equipment in the rental room,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     pay the deceased $600 every month with effect from the date the room was rented out,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     be responsible for the water and electricity bill and taxes every month and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     continue to be responsible for his daily living activities including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene, accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In line with this agreement, the room was subsequently rented out from January 2015 onwards at $1,800 per month. The deceased then issued signed receipts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> to the Plaintiff from January to July 2015 certifying that he had received payment of $600 from her as “payment for this month’s room rental”. The receipt further stated that “[the Plaintiff] is responsible for the repairs of the room, the water and electricity bill, taxes and purchase of various utensils. [The Plaintiff] is also responsible for the daily living activities of [the deceased], including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene and accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Sometime in July 2015, the deceased experienced breathlessness. The Plaintiff sent the deceased to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was admitted until 6 August 2015. Upon his discharge from hospital, the deceased was transferred to Ren Ci Community Hospital. However, his condition worsened and he was re-admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It was during this period of time that the deceased executed the Will on 17 August 2015 without the Plaintiff’s knowledge. He subsequently passed away on 2 September 2015. It is undisputed that prior to his death, the deceased suffered from diabetes, hypertension and, from about two months prior to his death, ischaemic heart disease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Circumstances leading up to the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Sometime after the deceased was admitted into Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the deceased contacted a family friend, L to visit him at the hospital. L knew the deceased for more than forty-five years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and the deceased would approach L for help from time to time with any issues that the deceased encountered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the hospital, the deceased stated to L that his marriage to the Plaintiff was a sham. He realised that the Plaintiff did not care for him and he did not wish to leave his flat to her. Being a senior director representing Great Eastern Life, with more than thirty years of experience in the insurance industry, L understood more about the execution of Wills than the average lay person.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> At the deceased’s instructions, L, with the assistance of his senior manager at the insurance office, prepared a Will in accordance with the deceased’s wishes i.e. for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be appointed as executor and the deceased’s flat to be left to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     According to L, although the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the deceased’s half-sister, the deceased cared more for and treated her better than his other full-blooded sisters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This was because the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had gone through a hard life and was financially poorer than the rest of the deceased and his siblings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As such, the deceased wanted to leave her with the most valuable asset he had i.e. his flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At the deceased’s request, L contacted the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to inform him that the deceased had appointed him as the executor of the Will and requested for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to find two persons to witness the execution of the Will and an interpreter to explain the Will to the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then contacted his sister-in-law, C, who was well-versed in English and mandarin and requested for her to interpret the Will to the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He also contacted his mother, who was the deceased’s sister, to assist in the finding of two witnesses for the Will. It is undisputed that the two witnesses found was J ( the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s brother) and I (J’s friend).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On 17 August 2015, L brought the Will to the hospital for the deceased’s execution. Prior to the execution of the Will, C explained the contents of the Will in mandarin to the deceased who confirmed that he understood the contents of the Will before executing it in the presence of the witnesses. The witnesses then signed the Will in the presence of the deceased. After the Will was executed by the deceased and the witnesses, L kept the Will on the deceased’s behalf.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It is undisputed that the Plaintiff did not know of the existence of the Will until after the death of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Relationship between the Plaintiff and the deceased</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Much of the dispute between parties pertains to the relationship between the Plaintiff and the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     According to the Plaintiff, both she and the deceased shared a regular marriage life where parties cared for each other. The deceased would buy the Plaintiff food that she liked to eat and also demonstrate care and concern for her daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He even volunteered to be the sponsor for her daughter’s application for permanent residency.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The deceased also introduced the Plaintiff to his neighbours as his wife. As the deceased was a retiree with little income, both of them would share the daily living costs after the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff’s claim of a regular marriage life is disputed by the Defendants. According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, he started visiting the deceased at the deceased’s flat after he learnt about the deceased’s marriage as he was concerned for his uncle’s well-being.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> During one of his visits in 2014, the deceased informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that he regretted marrying the Plaintiff as she had ceased to pay rental to him after becoming his wife. She also failed to take care of him despite her promise to. As a result, the deceased did not have any income or sufficient monies for his own needs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     This is corroborated by the evidence of L, a long-time family friend of the deceased. Sometime in 2014, the deceased had informed L that his marriage with the Plaintiff was a sham marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Although the Plaintiff had assured him she would continue to pay rent after the marriage, she ceased paying rental leaving the deceased with no income. As such, the deceased approached L for assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The deceased wanted to let others know of his sham marriage to the Plaintiff. As such, L made arrangements for reporters from the Chinese newspaper to interview the Plaintiff and the deceased at their home (“the newspaper article incident”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The details of the newspaper article arising from the interview is set out in paragraph 10 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     L’s version of events is disputed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff denies that the deceased had any involvement in or prior knowledge of the reporters’ visit to their home. The Plaintiff claims in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when the reporters first visited the deceased’s flat, they were brought to the home by the deceased’s sister. As such, the Plaintiff was under the impression that the reporters were also relatives of the deceased. It was only later during the visit that the Plaintiff discovered that they were reporters from the Chinese newspaper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Upon discovering that they were reporters, the Plaintiff acceded to the interview. However, just before the reporters left the deceased’s flat, they told the Plaintiff if she agreed to give up her inheritance of the deceased’s flat, they would not publish the interview in the newspaper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The next day, the deceased informed her that the reporters were patrons of his sister’s and nephew’s food stall and the reporters had gone to the deceased’s flat at their request. He also stated that they had nothing to fear if they did not do anything wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the trial, the Plaintiff gave a slightly different version of events. The Plaintiff alleged that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The reporters were brought to the flat by the deceased and his sister.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff was unaware throughout the entire visit that they were reporters from the Chinese newspaper.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While she was showing the reporters around the flat, out of the blue, they requested for her to write a note stating that she did not want the house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The next day after the article was published, the Plaintiff asked the deceased why he had brought reporters to the flat.

She immediately made her way to the hospital but before she could arrive, the deceased had already passed on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Upon arrival at the hospital, the Plaintiff noted that the deceased’s personal belongings were missing, such as his ATM card, identification card, cash and wedding ring. She was also informed by a nurse at the hospital that the deceased's relatives had been visiting him every night since 14 August 2015 and assumed that the deceased’s relatives had taken the said items.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Plaintiff initially claimed that the Will was only made known to her on 16 February 2016.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> However, at the trial, the Plaintiff conceded that she first learnt of the deceased's Will on 4 September 2015, just a few days after his death.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She received a call from L requesting that they meet at Tan Tock Seng mortuary to discuss matters concerning the deceased's funeral. At the time, the Plaintiff had no knowledge of who L was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     At the said meeting, L informed the Plaintiff of the existence of the Will but no document was produced. The deceased's siblings also threatened to report her to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (&quot;ICA&quot;) and to send her back to China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> It was subsequently agreed at the meeting that the Plaintiff would be responsible for the funeral arrangements of the deceased, which included cremation of the deceased’s body. The Plaintiff made the relevant arrangements and paid for the cremation of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Thereafter, the Plaintiff closed the deceased's bank account and withdrew the remaining sum of $3,222.45 from the account as cash, which she retained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff also applied to claim the CPF monies of the deceased. On 3 December 2015, the Plaintiff received a cheque for the sum of $39,989.76, being monies from the deceased's CPF account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 26 January 2016, the grant of probate was issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 16 February 2016, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and another of the deceased’s nephews showed up at the deceased's flat and informed the Plaintiff to vacate the said flat by 5 March 2016 as the Court has ordered the flat to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. At the time, the Plaintiff did not know who the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was or how she was related to the deceased. The Plaintiff asked for proof of the court order but they were unable to produce any documents in support of their claim. They then told the Plaintiff that they would return and show it to her another day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     A few days later, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant returned to the flat and showed the Plaintiff what appeared to be only the first page of the Will. This is disputed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who asserts that he had brought the complete Will with him at the time and given a copy to the Plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that as she was illiterate in English, she would need to seek legal advice on the purported Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Plaintiff subsequently engaged solicitors to request for a copy of the Will from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant but to no avail. She also requested through her solicitors for an extension of time until 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2016 to move out of the deceased’s flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Plaintiff subsequently obtained a certified true copy of the Will and the Grant of Probate from the Family Justice Courts. According to the Plaintiff, this was the first time that she had sight of the full Will. She became suspicious of the Will as she found paragraph 6 of the Will to be untrue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> She also denied the signature on the Will to be the deceased’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     On 30 June 2017, the Plaintiff commenced this action to dispute the validity of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The formal validity of a Will is governed by Section 5(2) of the Wills Act 1838, as set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>“Rules as to formal validity</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.—(2)    A will shall be treated as properly executed if its execution conformed to the internal law in force —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    in the territory where it was executed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    in the territory where the testator was domiciled at the time —</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(i) when the will was executed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(ii) or of his death;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    in the territory where the testator habitually resided at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in the state of which the testator was a national at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b)…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Where the Will was executed in Singapore, Section 6 of the Wills Act 1838 applies:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Mode of Execution</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.—(1)    No will shall be valid unless it is <em>in writing and executed in the manner mentioned in subsection (2).</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Every will shall be <em>signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator</em>, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, and the signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator as the signature to his will or codicil <em>in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time, and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator</em>, but no form of attestation shall be necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As such, for a Will to be validly executed, it has to be signed at the foot or the end by the testator, in the presence of at least two witnesses present at the same time and subscribed by those witnesses in the presence of the testator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Testamentary Capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is established law that the propounder of a Will bears the legal burden of proving that the deceased had testamentary capacity to execute a Will.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Testamentary capacity will generally be presumed, and will be <em>prima facie</em> established, when the Will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances i.e. where the testator was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. One indication of testamentary capacity is the rationality of the Will, having regard to its terms and the identities of the beneficiaries. If the Will is rational on its face, the testator is presumed to have had testamentary capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Once the presumption of testamentary capacity operates, the party challenging the Will may rebut this presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary, such as evidence that the testator was suffering from a medical illness that was serious enough for the court to find that the testator lacked testamentary capacity. The burden of proving the unsoundness of mind lies with the person alleging it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Knowledge and Approval of Contents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Where testamentary capacity is established, a rebuttal presumption arises that the testator knew and approved the contents of the Will and the evidential burden shifts in the ordinary circumstances to the opponent of the Will to rebut this presumption.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The presumption will not operate where there were circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the Will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the Will did not express the mind of the testator. Circumstances which have nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the Will are to be disregarded. Only circumstances that attend to or relate to the preparation and execution of the Will are relevant. Conduct after the preparation and execution of the Will may be taken into account if such conduct has a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Whether the testator approved of or had knowledge of the contents of the Will is based on whether the testator understood:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     what was in the Will when he/she signed it; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     what its effect would be</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(See case of <em>Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGCA 0027.xml')\">[2010] SGCA 27</a>; <em>ULV v ULW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22704-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 2</a><em>;</em> and <em>Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18800-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 24</a>.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Undue Influence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the context of a Will, undue influence cannot be presumed. The burden of proof is on the party alleging the undue influence and in the probate context, it means coercion i.e. the testator is coerced into making a Will (or part of a Will), which the testator does not want to make. It must be shown that the testator was not merely persuaded but was pressured into losing his freedom of choice. The persuasion or pressure must have been of such an intensity as to overpower the volition of the testator without actually convincing the testator in his or her own judgment. It must be shown that the party accused of undue influence dominated the testator to such an extent that the testator’s independence was so undermined that the accused party’s domination caused the testator to execute the Will. This is a high burden of proving undue influence to vitiate any testamentary disposition. The test for undue influence in the testamentary context is therefore coercion alone. (See <em>UWF &amp; Anor v UWH &amp; Anor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26192-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 314</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48      <em>In Rajaratnam Kumar (alias Rejaratnam Vairamuthu) v Estate of Rajaratnam Saravana Muthu (deceased) and another and another Suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0093.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 93</a>, then Tan Lee Meng J held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“This is not easy to prove as undue influence in the making of a will is usually proven by the testimony of witnesses present at the execution of the wills or by forensic analysis.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Court’s Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the deceased have testamentary capacity to execute the Will?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Plaintiff alleges at paragraph 10 of her Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1) that the deceased was not of sound mind, memory and understanding at the time he executed the Will due to the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The deceased suffered a long history of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He was critically ill at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A part of his foot below his toes was amputated on or about 12 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He was heavily sedated with medication and barely awake.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the deceased of unsound mind, memory and understanding at the time he executed the Will?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     With regards to (a), the medical condition of the deceased is undisputed. With regards to (b) and (d), I found that apart from bare allegations, the Plaintiff did not produce any evidence in support of her claims. On the contrary, the Defendants were able to produce a medical report dated 20 September 2018 from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“the medical report”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> setting out the following information obtained from the documentation in the hospital’s medical records:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The deceased underwent left forefoot amputation on 12 August 2015 with no complications. Before and after the surgery, he was found to be alert comfortable, oriented to time, place and person. He himself signed the consent form for both the anaesthesia and surgery on 12 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He was not heavily sedated and was given peripheral nerve block anaesthesia for the surgery on 12 August 2015, at 7.19 p.m. There were no documented pre- and post-operative anaesthesia complications noted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the day of surgery on 12 August 2015, including the day the deceased executed the Will on 17 August 2015, the deceased's vital signs were stable, alert and he was not in pain or distress. He was even seen by the physiotherapist on 18 August 2015 with no complain of pain and was able to ambulate with minimal assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The deceased was competent to speak and understand what was said to him on 17 August 2015. The medical records showed that he was alert, comfortable, oriented to time, place and person and with stable vital signs on that day. He was not critically ill and did not suffer from any temporary incapacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This is corroborated by the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the witnesses – C, J, I and L – during the trial that the deceased was alert, able to recognise them and spoke normally with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the contents of the Will rational?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     During the trial and from the affidavits and evidence of the Plaintiff, it appeared to me that the Plaintiff’s main concern with the Will pertained to paragraph 6 of the Will, which stated that the deceased had married the Plaintiff in order to help her extend her stay in Singapore as an accompanying person to her child. It further stated that the deceased and the Plaintiff were unable to consummate their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Plaintiff asserted that the contents of paragraph 6 were untrue. She was able to produce documentary evidence to show that her applications for her Long Term Visit Pass in Singapore from the years 2010 to 2016 were sponsored by a friend, and not the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff further asserts that parties had consummated the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While the purpose of this trial was not to determine whether the marriage of the deceased to the Plaintiff was indeed a “sham marriage”, the nature of their relationship is relevant for the purposes of assisting the court in determining whether the contents of the Will is rational. It is clear from the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L that the deceased did have some blatant reservations, doubts and misgivings about his marriage with the Plaintiff. This is evident from the deceased’s conversations with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L and the circumstances leading to the newspaper article incident and the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In relation to the newspaper article incident, I found it difficult to believe that the deceased was uninvolved or unaware of the intentions behind the visit of the reporters to his flat, given his complaints to L prior to the incident. I note further from the Plaintiff’s evidence that no introductions were made as to the identity of these unrelated persons upon their arrival and it was the Plaintiff’s own assumption that they were relatives of the deceased. As such, I found it unbelievable that the deceased himself would bring strangers into his home for a visit without prior knowledge of who they were. There were also inconsistencies in the affidavit of the Plaintiff and her oral testimony, as stated at paragraphs 25 and 26 above, which I found difficult to reconcile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I also found it unusual that the deceased would issue receipts to the Plaintiff from November 2014 to July 2015 for payments made by the Plaintiff to the deceased allegedly in the context of a regular marriage. Although the Plaintiff claims that the receipts were unilaterally issued by the deceased to prove that the Plaintiff did her part to share in the family expenses as his wife, I found that the contents of the receipt appeared to be more of a clear delineation of the Plaintiff’s responsibilities as a contractual exchange between parties. This is consistent with the deceased’s complaints to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L at paragraphs 16 and 17 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the above, I found that the deceased did not share the same view as the Plaintiff of the marriage being a valid one. Furthermore, given the deceased’s relationship and concern for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I did not find anything out of the ordinary for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to be stated as the sole beneficiary of his estate in the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In view of the evidence above, I found the contents of the deceased’s Will to be rational.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Presumption of Testamentary Capacity to operate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Based on the evidence before me, I am therefore satisfied that the presumption of testamentary capacity operates in this case. The Will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances where the deceased was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. The Will also appears to be rational on its face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Given that the presumption applies, the burden of proving that the deceased was of unsound mind at the time of execution of the Will lies with the person alleging it i.e. the Plaintiff. However, apart from bare allegations, the Plaintiff has not provided any evidence, such as independent medical reports, to support her claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As such, I find that the deceased was not of unsound mind, memory or understanding such that he was unable to execute the Will. On the contrary, the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity required to execute the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the deceased have knowledge of the contents of the Will and did he approve it? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Since the presumption of testamentary capacity applies, a rebuttal presumption that the deceased knew and approved the contents of the Will arises in the present case. In order to reverse the presumption, the Plaintiff needs to show that the Will had been executed under suspicious circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the deceased’s signature a forgery?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Plaintiff alleges that the deceased’s signature was a forgery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> However, apart from a bare allegation, I find that there is insufficient evidence provided by the Plaintiff in support of her claim. Although the Plaintiff had submitted a certified true copy of the deceased’s Will to the Health Sciences Authority to ascertain whether the signature on the copy of the Will was the deceased’s, as some of the sample documents and the copy of the Will itself were not original documents and did not contain the original signature of the deceased, the report from the Health Sciences Authority was inconclusive on whether the signature of the deceased on the Will was forged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> No other evidence was provided by the Plaintiff in support of her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Will prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of someone?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Plaintiff alleges that the Will was prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of “someone” or “some persons”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff alleges the following particulars in support of her claims:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the purported Will could not have been prepared by the Deceased as he has no knowledge of the English language and had no access to a typewriter or computer at the hospital,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the deceased soon died in hospital about 2 weeks after executing the purported Will,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the deceased did not disclose to the Plaintiff of his intention to make a Will,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Plaintiff seldom met any of the deceased's siblings during her visits to the hospital, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the deceased's siblings have acted with hostility towards the Plaintiff including vandalising the corridor outside the matrimonial home and bringing reporters from the Chinese newspaper to the matrimonial home unannounced to report that the Plaintiff's marriage to the Deceased was a sham which is untrue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In her Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1), the Plaintiff omitted to state specifically who had exercised undue influence over the deceased. However, from her affidavit and evidence, the Plaintiff appeared to be insinuating that the persons who were against her marriage with the deceased, being L and the deceased’s relatives, had conspired against her resulting in the alleged Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As stated at paragraphs 47 and 48 above, the law on undue influence is clear. It must be shown that the party accused of undue influence dominated the testator to such an extent that the testator’s independence was so undermined that the accused party’s domination caused the testator to execute the Will. The test for undue influence in the testamentary context is therefore coercion alone. This is a high burden of proving undue influence to vitiate any testamentary disposition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I find that apart from making a stab in the dark with bare allegations, the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to show that L, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or the deceased’s siblings had exercised undue influence over the deceased in the execution of the Will for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, it is undisputed that the deceased continued to live with the Plaintiff at the matrimonial flat prior to his admission into Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 6 August 2015. It was also the Plaintiff’s position that the deceased rarely met his siblings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> If that was indeed the case, it would appear difficult for the siblings to have any influence over the deceased given their lack of involvement in his life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to show that the deceased’s independence was so undermined by any of the deceased’s siblings or relatives such that they were able to coerce him into executing the Will. On the contrary, it is the Plaintiff’s own evidence that she visited the deceased every day when he was hospitalized and that she was his emergency contact. According to the Plaintiff, the deceased did not contact any of his siblings nor did he request for her to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In this regard, I find the Plaintiff’s evidence contradictory to her pleading of undue influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I also did not find any suspicious circumstances in relation to the execution of the Will for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Although the deceased was not literate in the English language, the deceased had instructed L to prepare the Will for him. The Will was subsequently interpreted and explained to the deceased before he executed it. The deceased did not need to have knowledge of the English language nor did he require access to a typewriter or a computer to prepare the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Notwithstanding the deceased died two weeks after the execution of the Will, there is evidence to show that the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the Will prior to his death.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given my findings in relation to the nature of the deceased’s relationship with the Plaintiff as stated at paragraphs 54 to 57 above, it would only seem logical that the deceased did not inform the Plaintiff of his intention to execute a Will disinheriting her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Although the Plaintiff may not have met the deceased’s siblings at the hospital, it does not eliminate the possibility of the deceased having met his siblings in her absence. In fact, it is the Plaintiff’s evidence that on 2 September 2015, she was informed by a nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital that the deceased's relatives had been visiting him every night since after 14 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e\"></a>(e)     With regard to the allegations of the deceased’s siblings vandalising the corridor outside the matrimonial home and bringing reporters from the Chinese newspaper to report on the alleged sham marriage between the deceased and the Plaintiff, I find that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       there is no evidence provided in the Plaintiff’s affidavit and her testimony in relation to the alleged vandalism.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       in relation to the Chinese newspaper article, I note that the incident occurred sometime in October 2014, almost 10 months prior to the preparation and execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       none of these allegations were relevant in relation to the actual preparation and execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     For the reasons stated at paragraphs 65 to 67 above, I find that the Plaintiff has not satisfied the high bar of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the deceased had executed the Will under the undue influence of “someone” or “some persons” nor were there any suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     With regard to the counterclaim, I accepted the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, C, L and the witnesses to the Will that the Will was duly executed by the deceased:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is undisputed by parties that the deceased was Chinese educated. He spoke mainly in mandarin and Hokkien.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     From the evidence of L, the contents of the Will were drafted in accordance with the instructions of the deceased. It was the deceased who requested for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be stated as the executor and for his flat to be left to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. The deceased further instructed that he did not wish to leave his flat to the Plaintiff as he was of the view that it was a sham marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the evidence of C and the witnesses to the Will, the contents of the Will was translated and explained to the deceased in mandarin. During the translation and explanation, C would ask the deceased whether he understood the contents of the Will and the deceased would nod and answer in the affirmative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Based on the medical report, the deceased was alert and was not temporarily incapacitated. He was able to speak and understand what was said to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_e\"></a>(e)     After the Will was translated and explained to the deceased, the deceased signed at the bottom of the Will, in the presence of the witnesses and followed by J and then I, who signed the Will in the presence of the deceased and of each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     As such, I find that the deceased did have knowledge of the contents of the Will and did approve the contents of the Will before voluntarily executing it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     In view of all the reasons stated above, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim and granted the Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiff for a declaration (a) pronouncing the force and validity of the Will dated 17 August 2015 made by the deceased and (b) that the Grant of Probate issued to the Defendants on 28 January 2016 be upheld.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Submissions on costs were adjourned to be heard at a later date. Parties have since submitted.

They had a child who was 11 years of age. Their marriage fell apart with interim judgment of divorce granted in June 2024. I divided the pool of their matrimonial assets, which comprised predominantly their matrimonial flat, 70:30 in favour of the husband. I also ordered that the parties share custody of the child, with care and control to the husband and liberal access to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Prior to the hearing of these ancillary matters, the husband had agreed to pay the wife a monthly sum of $660 for the maintenance of the child. I ordered that this arrangement continue, taking account of the modest income of the wife and the need for the wife to support the child during the liberal access that she had been granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The wife has filed an appeal against these decisions. I now provide my reasons for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In January 2017, the wife left the then-matrimonial residence, which was a room in an apartment that was owned by her mother-in-law, because of her “tumultuous relationship”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> with the mother-in-law. She took the child with her and headed to Indonesia, where she remained a citizen even after she had obtained permanent residency in Singapore. She returned to Singapore with the child in July 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, to avail of the healthcare infrastructure in Singapore. She moved with the child into the current matrimonial residence, which was a flat the keys to which had been collected by the husband in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The flat had been purchased in the sole name of the husband. He had applied to the Housing and Development Board to purchase the flat in 2013. He received a notice from the Housing and Development Board to collect the keys to the flat in 2017. Following delays, he eventually completed the purchase of the flat in April 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The primary matrimonial asset between the parties was the flat, which had been purchased in the sole name of and financed solely by the husband. It was not in dispute that the market value of the flat was $420,000 and the outstanding liability under the mortgage on the flat was $67,000. These figures produced a net value of the flat of $353,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband contended that he had taken personal loans from his family that totalled $35,000. He explained that he had done so to finance the purchase of the flat and its related expenditures. He submitted that his liability to repay the $35,000 should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. The wife denied this contention and asserted that the husband had “failed to substantiate the monies he allegedly borrowed from his family to purchase the matrimonial flat”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The husband exhibited bank records of two transfers that totalled $35,000 that he had received from his family. He deposed that these transactions had taken place at or around April 2019, which was the time when he had completed the purchase of the flat,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and which evidence was not challenged by the wife. Although these bank records were silent on the purpose of the transfers, I saw no reason to disbelieve the husband that the transfers were connected to the purchase of the flat given their proximity to the time when he had completed the purchase of the flat. On the evidence, these transfers had likely been advances to the husband for his purchase of the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Further, it was likely that the $35,000 had been advanced to the husband by way of a loan rather than by way of a gift. Although the contemporaneous documentation on the nature of the advance was scant, it was not in dispute that the husband had taken advances on his credit cards at or around the same time. There was no dispute that these advances on the credit cards of the husband were loans that the husband had taken. Given the proximity in the time of the advances taken by the husband from the credit cards companies to the time the advances taken by the husband from his family, I accepted the explanation of the husband that the latter advances were likewise loans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The value of the matrimonial assets was thus $318,000. This sum took account the $420,000 market value of the matrimonial flat, the $67,000 liability under the mortgage on the flat, and the $35,000 liability of the husband under the loans from his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties were in accord that the “structured approach” in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> governed the division of their matrimonial assets and that the husband solely financed the acquisition of the matrimonial assets. The direct contributions of the parties were thus 100:0 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The marriage lasted 13 years. The child of the marriage was 11 years of age. The wife was a homemaker for the earlier half of the marriage. During that time, she cooked and cleaned the matrimonial residence and looked after the child. But she then left the matrimonial residence for Indonesia for four years and uprooted the child in doing so. By default, the wife had made herself the sole caregiver of the child during these four years. But it was difficult to award her credit by way of indirect contributions for this arrangement. For these four years, the child was deprived of the care by the husband and of the benefits of co-parenting, which has “a positive effect on [child] development and well-being” (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> at [33]). Indeed, the child was cared for less by the wife and more by her relatives for much of these four years,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> which arrangement left the wife with limited parenting to perform. These four years also disrupted the education of the child, who was then of school-going age. Even so, the husband continued to maintain the child in the weekly sum of $150. He also visited the wife and the child in Indonesia three or four times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> When the wife and the child returned to Singapore in 2020, the husband provided for them from his income as a private-hire driver while the wife sought employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> After the wife found employment as a barista, the husband cared for the child from day to day when the wife performed night shifts that necessitated her sleeping in the daytime. In these premises, I assessed the indirect contributions at 60:40 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Averaging the direct contributions of 100:0 in favour of the husband and the indirect contributions of 60:40 in favour of the wife gave a final ratio of 70:30 in favour of the husband. I thus divided the pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of $318,000 (see [10] above) in the proportions of 70% to the husband and 30% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child welfare</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In considering the custody and upbringing of a child, the first and paramount consideration was the welfare of the child. That was the statutory imperative set out in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (2020 Rev Ed). And this entailed a multi-faceted and multi-factorial analysis that recognised that “welfare” had to be understood in its widest sense (see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The wife initially sought the sole custody of the child. The husband proposed that the parties share joint custody of the child. The wife eventually agreed with this proposal.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I thus ordered that the husband and the wife share joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The wife and the husband each sought the care and control of the child. The wife submitted that she was the primary caregiver of the child and that the child was closer to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The husband submitted that he was the caregiver of the child from day to day and had provided the child with a stable and secure environment that conduced to the best interests of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On a balance of probabilities, awarding the husband the care and control of the child conduced to the best interests of the child. The husband cared deeply for the child. Moreover, he had throughout the life of the child been ready and able to care for the child. Up until the child was removed from his care in 2017, he had participated in the upbringing of the child. Even when the wife had so removed the child, there was no evidence that the husband had failed to discharge his parental responsibilities. Rather, the wife had done so because of her unhappiness with her mother-in-law. Yet the husband did not let this removal of the child deter him from discharging his parental responsibilities to the child; he supported for the child as best he could by maintaining the child in the weekly sum of $150 and by visiting the child in Indonesia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> After the child was returned to Singapore, he provided shelter and a secure environment for the child that conduced to the development of the child. He cared for the child from day to day, and especially when the wife performed night shifts and slept in the daytime. He made time for the child whenever the child needed care by leveraging on the flexibility that he enjoyed in his work as a private-hire driver. He enlisted his mother, the paternal grandmother, to care for the child while he was at work. Ultimately, the husband was a hands-on father who had been immersed in the upbringing of the child and who was a capable caregiver for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The wife, like the husband, cared for the child. But she was prone to decisions in her self-interest that could come at the expense of the child. She removed the child from Singapore after a disagreement with her mother-in-law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> She did so without regard to the disruption that it would bring to the child, who was a citizen of Singapore, and without any viable plans on the caregiving of the child. For four months, she left the child with her relatives in Batam while she “shuttled back and forth [to] Singapore for work”. Only thereafter did she bring the child to Jakarta, where her family could care for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These events disrupted the education of the child and upended the life of the child, who was shunted first from Singapore to Batam, then from Batam to Jakarta, and finally from Jakarta back to Singapore. This volatility would have been particularly jarring for the child, who had special needs and who had been barely four years of age at the time of these events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Leaving aside this capriciousness, concerns remained in how the wife would discharge the care and control of the child after the divorce. Her living arrangements were unclear, and her caregiving plans for the child were murkier still. She provided scant details on how she would shelter the child or on how she would care for the child given her variable work schedule that required her to perform night shifts and that in turn necessitated her sleeping-in during the day. To remove the child from the familiarity of the caregiving network that had been put together by the husband and his mother and introduce the child into this uncertainty was hardly in the best interests of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     For completeness, the wife alleged that the husband had abused her physically, mentally and emotionally. She claimed that she had left in 2017 Singapore “due to the tumultuous relationship she has with the [mother-in-law] and the lack of support from the [husband]”. She added that it was the husband who “suggested that [she] leave Singapore if she was unhappy” in 2017 and who would “shout at her to return to Indonesia” whenever they argued following her return to Singapore in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I struggled to accept that the wife had been abused by the husband. There was no evidence beyond her self-serving assertions that she had been so abused. The predominant reason for her departure from the matrimonial residence in 2017 was, in her words, her “tumultuous relationship” with her mother-in-law. Even if, as she alleged, the husband had not supported her during this turmoil, that omission did not establish that he had abused her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In any event, any turmoil between the wife and the husband or between the wife and the mother-in-law was not relevant to whether the husband or the wife could better care for the child. On the evidence, the husband had been a capable parent who provided a stable and secure environment that conduced to the development of the child. This stability and security were crucial at least in the immediate future, when the child would be taking a national examination. Notwithstanding the maternal bond, the child was close to and comfortable with the husband and the paternal grandmother, who had put in place workable arrangements for his upbringing. The interests of the child would thus be best served by placing him in the care and control of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Even so, it would be in the interests of the child for the husband and wife to co-parent the child despite any disagreements that they had between themselves. I thus granted the wife liberal access (including overnight access) to the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     access every weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     access for half of the school holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     access on alternate Chinese New Year holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The wife sought monthly maintenance of $1,000 for herself and $1,400 for the child. The husband submitted that no maintenance should be ordered for the wife but promised to “fully support his son financially in Singapore”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the wife, I agreed with the husband that no spousal maintenance was necessary. The wife earned a monthly income of $1,900. That income, together with her share of the matrimonial assets (which share amounted to $95,400), equipped the wife to support herself following the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For the child, it was not in dispute that the husband had during these proceedings provided the wife a monthly sum of $660 for the expenses of the child. Having awarded the care and control of the child to the husband, there was, in principle, limited basis to order the husband to finance the spending of the wife on the child. Even so, I had granted the wife liberal access to the child, including for most of each weekend and half of the child’s school holidays. Given these substantial periods in which the wife would be caring for the child, and given the $3,500 earning capacity of the husband, I ordered that the husband continue to provide the same sum each month to the wife for the expenses of the child. This sum would alleviate, at least for the near future, the financial load that the wife would be bearing while the child was in her care during access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I thus divided the pool of their matrimonial assets, which were valued at $318,000, in the proportions of $222,600 to the husband and $95,400 to the wife. I awarded the care and control of the child to the husband, with liberal access to the wife. I ordered the husband to provide the wife with a monthly sum of $660 for the expenses of the child while the child was in her care. I finally urged the parties to work together to co-parent the child in a manner that promoted stability in the caregiving and living arrangements of the child, especially in the immediate future when the child would be taking a national examination.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [36.2]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>2HAOM23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [32]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [49]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [50] and [52]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at [55]–[56]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [36.2]–[36.3]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Personal Protection Order – Domestic Exclusion Order"],"date":"2024-08-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Personal Protection Summons No. SS 1541/2023, SS 1542/2023, SS 1543/2023 & SS 2261/2023","title":"XAW v XAX and other matters","citation":"[2024] SGFC 27","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31931-SSP.xml","counsel":["S.

INTRODUCTION</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These were proceedings by two sisters against their sister and brother for Personal Protection Orders (“<b>PPO</b>”) and domestic exclusion orders (“<b>DEO</b>”) to exclude them from their late mother’s home where they resided (“<b>Residence</b>”) (collectively referred to as the “<b>Applications</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>a)     SS 1541 of 2023 - Complainant (“<b>Sister A</b>”) for a PPO and DEO in respect of the Residence against Respondent (“<b>Sister B</b>”).

Filed on 31 August 2023 (“<b>SS 1543</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>d)     SS 2261 of 2023 - Complainant (“<b>Sister C</b>”) for a PPO and DEO in respect of the Residence against Respondent (“<b>Brother A</b>”). Filed on 18 December 2023 (“<b>SS 2261</b>”). This was filed to make reference to other incidents that had occurred since the filing of SS 1542.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>I will refer collectively to Sister C and Sister A as the “Complainants” and to Sister B and Brother A as the “Respondents”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The applications originating from the conflict and disagreements between the siblings over the care of their late mother (“<b>Mother</b>”). The Mother became ill around 2021 and was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2022. Sister B, Sister C, Sister A lived in the home together and took care of the Mother. They were also assisted by another sister, Sister D. It should be noted that Sister A and Sister C have their own residences. Sister C normally resides in Australia with her husband and Sister A has her own home elsewhere in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       During this period, the siblings found themselves in disagreement over the Mother’s care and the running of her household expenses and finances. They were split into two factions. The first faction comprised of Sister C, Sister A and Sister D. Sister C and Sister A were appointed as deputies over the Mother’s affairs and assets in OSM 167 of 2022 by an order dated 28 February 2023. The second faction comprised of Sister B and Brother A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The conflict between the siblings who continued to live in the Residence eventually escalated into verbal and physical altercations between the parties and on 31 August 2023, Sister C and Sister A filed SS 1541, 1542, 1543. On 7 September 2023, Sister C filed SS 1594 and 1595 of 2023 (“<b>SS 1594</b>” and <b>SS 1595</b>”) against Sister B and Brother A respectively for PPOs and DEOs in respect of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 29 October 2023, the Mother passed away. On 2 November 2023, the Court gave leave to withdraw SS 1594 and 1595.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 18 December 2023, Sister C and Sister A respectively filed SS 2260 and 2262 of 2023 against Sister B (“<b>SS 2260</b>” and “<b>SS 2262</b>”), and Sister C filed SS 2261 against Brother A. In these applications they also sought PPOs and DEOs against Sister B and Brother A, but filed these applications to make reference to incidents that had occurred after the filing of SS 1541, 1542, 1543 in 31 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 8 January 2024, SS 2260 and 2262 were struck off as the Complainant’s counsel was not present for their mentions. At a subsequent mentions on 16 February 2024, the Complainants applied to reinstate SS 1594, 1595, 2260 and 2262 as they wished to refer to the facts in these proceedings to obtain PPOs and DEOs against Sister B and Brother A in the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Court declined to reinstate SS 1594 and 1595 as the Mother was already deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Court declined to reinstate SS 2260 and 2262 as the facts referred to in these matters could be placed before the Court in the hearing of the Applications by giving leave to file a supplementary affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I only make reference to these matters for context, and because I was also required to provide a decision on costs in SS 1594, 1595, 2260 and 2262. In respect of SS 1594 and 1595, I made no order as to costs as they had been withdrawn due to the demise of the Mother who was the subject matter of the application. As for SS 2260 and 2262 I addressed the issue of costs wholistically together with the costs in the Applications as the allegations in SS 2260 and 2262 formed part of the facts raised in the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I proceeded to hear the Applications on 25 and 26 April 2024. On the first day of trial on 25 April 2024, Brother A informed the Court that he did not wish to participate further in the proceedings due to stress arising from personal issues. He stayed until the cross examination of Sister C was completed before lunch and did not return after that. He did not show up on the second day of trial on 26 April 2024 either.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 26 April 2024, I dismissed the Applications against Sister B and Brother A, and ordered Sister C and Sister A to each pay Sister B $6,000.00 in costs (for a combined total of $12,000.00 in costs).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 8 May 2024, Sister C filed her Notices of Appeal against my decision in SS 1542/2023, SS 1543/2023 &amp; SS 2261/2023. For completeness, I set out below my full grounds of decision in respect of all the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">B. THE LAW</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.    <u>Family Violence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Section 65 read with Section 64 of The Women’s Charter defines “<em>family violence</em>” as the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     “<em>Hurt</em>” as referred to in (a) and (b) above means “<em>bodily pain, disease or infirmity</em>”. The Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) also clarifies that “<em>family violence</em>” does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.    <u>Physical Violence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The spectrum of physical violence, restraint or threats that can amount to family violence is quite broad. Findings of family violence have been made in the following cases involving a single act or repeated acts of physical violence, restraint or threats. For instance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A man prevented his wife from leaving the home by pushing her and holding on to the gate so that she could not open it (<em><u>NR v NQ</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52377-M.xml')\">[2007] SGMC 4</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A man had slammed sister against a wall when she grabbed him in order to restrain him from attacking her friend (<em><u>Tan Ying Hui (Chen Yinghui) v Tan Zhi Xuan</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0049.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 49</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.    <u>Continual Harassment</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Continual harassment was helpfully defined in the case of <em><u>Yue Tock Him@Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“<b>Yue</b>”) at [33] as :</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause and which he ought reasonably to know would cause worry, emotional distress of annoyance to another person…”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, given the infinite ways in which people are capable of causing distress or annoyance to each other, this should not be regarded as an exhaustive definition. That was also the view of the Court in <em>Yue</em>, which noted that the above definition was <em>“not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the term but rather one that sufficiently encompasses the facts of the present case in order to proceed with a consideration of the law.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17      <em>Yue</em> also provided at [42], that the acts of “<em>continual harassment</em>” must also be of a sufficiently serious magnitude in order to be regarded as “<em>family violence</em>”. Consequently, in the case of <em><u>Chua Li Choo v Teo Swee Theng</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/49514-M.xml')\">[2005] SGDC 241</a>, at [22], it was held that making a police report did not amount to continual harassment. In that case, a husband had made a police report after the wife had locked him out of the marital home and told him that she would only let him in if he called the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     This approach is understandable. At the end of the day, and given the extremely wide scope of acts that may be raised as allegations of continual harassment, a sensible and balanced approach must be taken. After all, protection orders are meant to protect people from harmful acts, and if the threshold is lowered to include acts that are merely unpleasant but without sufficient gravity, then this may result in individuals abusing the court process to settle their own petty personal disputes or vendettas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">IV.    <u>Necessity</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even after a finding of family violence is made on the facts, the Court still has to make its assessment of whether it is necessary to grant a protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a protection order is not granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     This is because a personal protection order is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if there will be no family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (<em>Yue</em>, at [64]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In determining necessity, the Court must consider all the circumstances, but it is useful to weigh up the following factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>a)     Are the parties still living together or likely to remain in contact?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>b)     What is the original cause of the conflict and has it been resolved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>c)     The severity of the incident of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will now address the facts and the application of law to the facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">C.   Allegations of Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the Applications, a considerable number of allegations were made in respect of the Respondents’ conduct towards their Mother (reprising facts raised in SS 1594 and 1595), their personal affairs, and their interactions with persons other than the Complainants. I informed parties that while their underlying family disputes provided some context for their disagreements, I would not make a determination on them. I was mainly concerned with the allegations involving alleged family violence against each other, which I will address further below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   Allegations against Sister B</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Calls to the Police</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Complainants alleged that there were numerous occasions during which Sister B had escalated conflict by calling the police to come to the Residence. This was not borne out by the evidence. Sister C was only able to identify one incident in 2022 where Sister B had called the police. Sister B stated on the stand that she had only made two reports – April 2022 and 3 December 2023. There was therefore insufficient proof that the police were being called down regularly to the Residence by Sister B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Flashing her underwear</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     There was a general reference in Sister C’s evidence, mirrored by Sister A and Sister D evidence, that “in past verbal jousts”, Sister B had lifted her skirt up at Sister C and Sister A, exposing her underwear. This was done to express displeasure and allegedly humiliate them. The evidence did not state any specific occasion or date when this occurred. Therefore I took the view that there was insufficient evidence that such acts had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>27 January 2023 Incident – Alleged Physical Assault</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Here, it was alleged that during an argument on 27 January 2023, Sister B had accused both Sister C and Sister A of ganging up on her, and followed Sister A into the kitchen where she had hit Sister A on the back of the head with a closed fist. During the argument, she had also accused Sister A of being a “lallang” who vacillated in her loyalties and had taunted Sister C by wagging her tongue and making odd animal noises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I made the finding there was an argument. Sister B did taunt Sister C as stated. Sister B also admitted to calling Sister A “lallang” but claimed she only stuck her finger on Sister A’s forehead when asking her to use her own mind and not be biased in her opinions. I make the finding that Sister A was hit by Sister B on the back of her head, but it is more likely to have been a push of the head from the back as Sister A confirmed that she was still able to splash water on Sister B in response. It is clear that at the time, parties did not think much of the incident. There were no police reports made on the day or close to the date. No medical report or even pictures. It was only in 27 June 2023 when proceedings were contemplated that a police report was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>30 July 2023 – the “Shaitan” incidents</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It was alleged that Sister B had called Sister C a “shaitan” (a devil) on numerous occasions. On 30 July 2023, Sister B called Sister C a “shaitan” in the morning. Later in the afternoon, Sister B told the maid to play recorded Islamic prayers as there were many “shaitans” in the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     On this, I make the finding that Sister B called Sister C a “shaitan” not just on 30 July 2023, but numerous times. I also find that she asked the maid to play recorded Islamic prayers to ward off “shaitans” in the house later in the day on 30 July 2023. Nothing was said though about the volume at which these prayers were played at and if they were intolerably loud. While Sister B stated on the stand that she played these prayers every other day, there was actually no complaint by Sister C and Sister A about how regularly these prayers were being played. Therefore I took the view that Sister C and Sister A were not really affected by the playing of the Islamic recordings on 30 July 2023, and this cannot constitute a form of harassment. I also found that to address a person by a term of abuse may be offensive, but the law on continual harassment clearly sets a higher bar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>3 December 2023 – A video recording incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On 3 December 2023, during an argument with Sister A, Sister B took out her phone and started recording Sister A. Sister B admitted to doing so. I found that making a video recording of an argument cannot constitute harassment. There was nothing offensive or insidious about the recording. Both Sister C and Sister A admitted that all the parties in the video were fully clothed and not being captured in some embarrassing or indecent situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>31 October 2023 – 1st prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 31 October 2023, Sister C went to pray in the Mother’s bedroom with the helper. Sister B was already in the room, and once Sister C and the helper started praying, Sister B scolded them for not praying in the correct Islamic verse. After being corrected by the helper, Sister B remained silent. Both Sister C and Sister B did not dispute this version of events, save as to the tone that Sister B used when correcting Sister C and the helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I did not think there was an issue here. Sister B made a mistake about Sister C and the helper praying in the correct Islamic verse. After being corrected, the matter ended there. There was no need to elevate it to some form of harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>4 November 2023 – 2nd prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     On 4 November 2023, it was alleged that Sister B insisted to pray in a part of the Mother’s bedroom that Sister C had chosen despite Sister C having entered the room first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     This was an incident that was blown out of proportion. On cross examination, it was revealed by Sister C that while Sister C entered the room first, Sister B was the first person to enter the praying spot. At worst, it was just a disagreement. Sister C also confirmed that there were no angry or hurtful words exchanged between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>14 November 2023 – 3rd prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On 14 November 2023, Sister C was praying in the Mother’s bedroom with one of the helpers. Sister B was talking loudly in the adjoining kitchen. After Sister C had told a helper to ask Sister B to keep her volume down, Sister B did so for a few minutes before watching videos of her grandchildren. Sister B also asked another helper loudly where the tomatoes were stored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     While I found that all of the above had happened, it is not clear that Sister B was doing so deliberately to upset Sister C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In my view, this was another incident which was blown out of proportion. It is not clear if Sister B was even aware that Sister C was praying in her Mother’s room at the start. As for Sister B’s conduct after being told to keep quiet, she did not speak loudly in an extended conversation. She was watching her videos and it cannot be harassment to just ask a helper once where tomatoes are stored. If Sister C had wanted some privacy and quiet when praying she should simply have asked the helper to shut the door to the Mother’s bedroom and the kitchen so that the noise level could be reduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">31   Allegations against Brother A</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On 25 August 2023, while Sister B and Sister C were having an argument, Brother A came down to the Residence after being asked by Sister B to do so. Minutes after arriving, he got into an altercation with Sister C and forcefully pushed her head backwards with the outstretched palm of his right hand. As mentioned above, Brother A did not participate in the proceedings other than sitting through Sister C’s cross-examination, during which he did not ask any question of her. He did not present himself for cross examination and did not make submissions at the conclusion of the hearing. I therefore found Sister C’s version of events had occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">32    <u>Conclusions</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To summarise, I found that Brother A had inflicted physical violence on Sister C, and that Sister B had inflicted physical violence on Sister A. However, Sister B had not inflicted physical violence on Sister C or continually harassed her and Sister A. The incidents between Sister B and Sister C reflected unpleasant and rude behavior on her part but did not amount to continual harassment. It cannot be that a case of continual harassment can be mad out by aggregating every mean word or gesture that has been exchanged between two sisters who cannot get along. Therefore I dismissed SS 1543.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">D.   NECESSITY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On the issue of necessity for a PPO or DEO, I understood that parties would continue to remain in the Residence and continue to remain in conflict as there would probably be a dispute over how the Mother’s estate would be administered. Sister C, Sister A and Sister B were also joint owners of the Residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     However, I noted that in respect of SS 1542 and 2261 (between Sister C and Brother A), both of them did not live in the same residence. Sister C stayed in the Residence and Brother A had his own home. The physical altercation between them on 25 August 2023 was a one-off incident. Therefore, I found there was insufficient likelihood that Brother A would be prompted to enter the Residence and assault Sister C. So, I dismissed the applications for a PPO and DEO in SS 1542 and 2261, noting too that the Residence was not a “shared residence” as defined under the Charter, section 64 for which a DEO could be ordered in respect of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In respect of SS 1541 (between Sister A and Sister B), the same issue also arose. Both of them did not live in the same residence either. Sister B stayed in the Residence and Sister A had her own home. No serious physical harm was caused to Sister A during the incident on 27 January 2023, and I also regarded the altercation as a one off. So, I also dismissed the applications for a PPO and DEO in SS 1541, noting too that the Residence was not a “shared residence” as defined under the Charter, section 64 for which a DEO could be ordered in respect of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">E.   COSTS</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Costs will be ordered against Sister A and Sister C in SS1541 and 1543. In Sister A’s case, there was one case of family but no necessity. In Sister C’s case, there were no cases of family violence that were found. Here, costs of a more significant nature would be justified as numerous events and facts were adduced by both Sister C and Sister A on their longstanding disagreements with the Respondents, which were only of tangential relevance to the case, which Sister B had to respond to in her evidence. This resulted in a total of 9 affidavits filed by the Complainants and 7 affidavits filed by the Respondents which had to be ventilated in a 2 day trial. The bulk of this evidence and work done in respect of responding to them by affidavit was wasted and thrown away as they were only of tangential relevance and excluded from cross examination to focus on allegations that might make a real difference to my decision i.e. the actual incidents of alleged family violence. So the appropriate cost order would be as follows : for SS 1541 – Sister A to pay Sister B costs of $6,000, for SS 1543 – Sister C to pay Sister B costs of $6,000. This would be all in, including disbursements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     On SS 1542, 2260, 2261 and 2262, I made no costs orders. For SS 1542 and 2261, Brother A was acting in person. For SS 2260 and 2262, the cost issues in relation to the allegations made in these matters had already been addressed by my cost orders in SS 1541 and 1543 and there was no need to duplicate them.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Yue Tock Him@Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a>, para 33</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2024-08-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 61 of 2024","title":"XAS v XAR","citation":"[2024] SGFC 58","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31925-SSP.xml","counsel":["Complainant in person","Respondent in person"],"timestamp":"2024-08-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheela Kumari Devi","html":"<root><head><title>XAS v XAR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAS <em>v</em> XAR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31925-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 58</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Maintenance Summons No 61 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sheela Kumari Devi </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Complainant in person; Respondent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XAS — XAR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Sheela Kumari Devi:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties (whom I will refer to as the <b>“Mother</b> and the <b>“Father”</b>) were married on 14 February 2007. They have three children to the marriage namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     [Child 1], 16 years old, born in August 2007 (<b>“[Child 1]”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     [Child 2], 11 years old, born in March 2012 (<b>“[Child 2]”</b>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     [Child 3], 4 years old, born in October 2019 (<b>“[Child 3]”</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(collectively referred to as the <b>“Children”</b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father moved out of the matrimonial flat sometime in 2023. The Mother has been maintaining the Children on her own and applied by way of the present proceedings for a maintenance order to be made against the Father for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties appeared in person and the trial was conducted over a half day with the Father electing to have a court interpreter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother is about 40 years old and is presently employed as a domestic worker agent. The Father is about 42 years old and is unemployed. He is a bankrupt and states that he will be starting a new job as a market stall assistant in July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       At the conclusion of the hearing, I ordered for the Father to provide maintenance for the Children as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.76%\"><col width=\"40.1%\"><col width=\"40.14%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 1] :</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 2]:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$455</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 3]:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$495</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father has since applied for legal aid and filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision. I shall now set out my brief reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother’s case is that the Father has not been paying maintenance for the past one and a half years. The Mother has not been able to manage the expenses of the household and the Children due to her limited income and has racked up credit card debts and accumulated arrears on the HDB housing loan as a result. The Mother also asserts that the Father must be employed due to instances when she has witnessed him driving and doing live videos on Facebook selling frozen food. The Mother also asserts that Father is continuing with the business of selling frozen food which she used to do together with him in previous years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father’s case is that he is only able to provide maintenance of $450 per month for the Children given his current financial position. The Father states that he has been unemployed for nearly 2 years. The reasons for his unemployment are as follows: (a) he only has primary-level education; (b) he has been imprisoned on 3 occasions; and (c) he was self-employed previously before becoming a bankrupt which has led to difficulties in gaining employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In applications for maintenance for a child, s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (<b>“WC”</b>) provides that “[t]he court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for [his] child who is unable to maintain [himself], order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The threshold issue is whether the Father has neglected and/or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Children. If neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance is established, then the court considers the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. In this regard, section 69(4) of the WC sets out the factors that the court can consider when ordering maintenance, such as the financial needs of the relevant parties, the income, earning capacity and other financial resources of the relevant parties and the standard of living enjoyed by them, amongst others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(a)   Neglect</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s evidence that the Father had not been paying maintenance since he moved out in 2023 was not disputed by the Father. In the circumstances, I do find that the Father has neglected to provide maintenance for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(b)   The Children’s Expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I accepted the Mother’s lists of expenses for the Children (after she adjusted certain expenses on the witness stand for the first child) set out as follows:</p> <p

any specific objections to the expenses set forth by the Mother apart from just stating a general objection at the trial that the expenses ought to be lesser. This was in spite of the Court informing him that he could cross-examine the Mother on the specific expenses (if any) that he took objection to. However, he chose not to do so. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In my view, the Mother’s lists of expenses for the Children (after taking into account the adjustments she made on the witness stand) were reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(c)   Father’s Income and Earning Capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father states that he will be starting a new job as a market stall assistant in July 2024 and will be earning a sum of $1,500 per month. As such, he will only be able to contribute the sum of $450 for the Children’s maintenance. The Father states that he has had difficulty gaining employment over the past 2 years as he was self-employed prior to his bankruptcy. Other impediments to him gaining employment are his prison record and low level of education. The Father also states that prior to his bankruptcy, he was in the business of import and export and was earning an income of $10,000 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Father states that he has been able to provide for his own personal expenses by way of borrowing money from his father and his friends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother disputes that the Father is unemployed. The Mother states that she has seen the Father driving around in a car<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and has also been informed by her friend that the Father has been posting live videos on Facebook selling frozen food<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also states that parties had previously run a business selling frozen food together and she believes that the Father is still continuing on with this business in light of the Father’s Facebook videos<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s position, on the stand, was that whilst he had appeared on Facebook live videos selling frozen food, it did not necessarily mean that he was making money from it and that these videos were done for entertainment and marketing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Father also stated that the car he was driving belonged to his friend.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father did not produce any evidence of his efforts to obtain employment or to demonstrate he could not obtain employment that was commensurate with his previous earning capacity of $10,000. The Father also did not produce any evidence of the loans he had taken from his father and his friends to sustain his living expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having heard the parties, I did not accept the Father’s contention that he had not been earning any income for the last 2 years. No evidence was produced of his apparent efforts to gain employment and, also, of the loans that had been extended by his father and friends to pay for his expenses over these last 2 years. There was no cogent evidence put forward to demonstrate why the Father had not been able to procure basic employment over such a prolonged period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Overall, I find that the Father has not discharged his evidential burden to show that he is unable to afford and/or pay maintenance for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Whilst it was difficult for this Court to determine what exactly the Father’s income and/or earning capacity was in light of the dearth of evidence, I note that the Mother’s position was for parties to bear the expenses of the Children equally. This was notwithstanding the fact that she was not earning a particularly high take home income of $1,400 (which was not disputed by the Father). Whilst the Mother had professed hopes of getting better paying employment, this would not raise her income very significantly. In light of the Mother’s position (which I found to be reasonable) and using a broad brush approach, I was of the view that the Father should bear half of the Children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the reasons set out above, I made my orders for maintenance as set out at paragraph 5 above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 35</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, pp 38 to 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 37</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 41</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, pp 40 to 41</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 42</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 37</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Section 28 Family Justice Act 2014 – examination of children – expert evidence – access – video and audio recordings of children"],"date":"2024-07-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1294 of 2023","title":"XAB v XAC","citation":"[2024] SGFC 53","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31844-SSP.xml","counsel":["SC Teh Guek Ngor Engelin with Rebecca Vathanasin (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the Plaintiff","Yap Yongzhi, Gideon with Tan Shern Wen, Joshua (Martin & Partners LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-08-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Shin Yi","html":"<root><head><title>XAB v XAC</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAB <em>v</em> XAC </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31844-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 53</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

This application directly concerns the question of whether a young child of 4 years should be examined by a psychologist or qualified therapist, and also raised issues regarding the impact of high-conflict divorces on young children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I declined to grant the application in this case, as I did not find it necessary or in the best interests of the child to subject him to a psychological assessment. It is essential to first understand the background to this application, before I explain my reasons below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties were married in January 2016 and they have a young child, A, who is currently 4 years old. The Plaintiff mother (“the Mother”) filed for divorce in March 2023, citing the unreasonable behaviour of the Defendant father (“the Father”). Interim Judgment was granted on 20 June 2023. On 31 July 2023, the Father filed a Summons application for interim access to A (SUM 2404/2023). On 16 August 2023, the Mother filed a Summons application to restrain the Father from removing A from school before the end of the school day (SUM 2579/2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Consent Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 September 2023, the parties attended mediation in court and the following consent orders were recorded:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Pending the resolution of SUM 2404/2023 for interim access, the Father shall have interim access to A:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_a\"></a>(a)       From 5-6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays; during which time the Father shall take A to the nearby playground located at B Park. Such access shall commence on 18 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_b\"></a>(b)       From 9am to 1.30pm on Saturdays. The Father shall take A to a public place, including XX Club, and there shall be no restrictions as to who will accompany the Father during his time with A. Such access shall commence on 16 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The Mother’s domestic helper shall accompany A during all access sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The Father shall pick A up from the matrimonial home located at XY (“the Matrimonial Home”) at the start of each access session and return A to the Matrimonial Home at the end of each access session.

The application is for (i) a psychologist from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) or specific therapist to examine the child, A, for “purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”; and (ii) in the interim, pending the psychologist’s report, parties to have joint custody of A, the Mother to have care and control and the Father to have interim access as per the terms of the Consent Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother claimed that the application was necessary because A started behaving differently after the commencement of divorce proceedings in March 2023, and that the Father and his family members began to treat A “differently”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Mother claimed that (i) the Father started to take A up to his bedroom to the exclusion of her domestic helper, instead of allowing A to roam freely in his parents’ home; and (ii) the Father and his family members started “speaking negatively”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> about the Mother to A, telling A that he would be living with them and they would care for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother also claimed that the Father started<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> buying more toys to “bribe and manipulate” A, and picking A up from school and “prevented” the Mother’s domestic helper from exiting the vehicle to pick A up from the school lobby or only picked the helper up after he had already picked A up from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       More significantly, the Mother claimed that the Father and his family members had engaged in what she termed as “negative stoking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, which allegedly caused confusion and distress in A. She stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> A would often return to the Matrimonial Home after access “looking very disoriented and confused” and would have frequent temper tantrums and meltdowns; and would wake up multiple times in the night crying for the Mother, which he did not do before. The Mother also claimed that after A returned from access, he began<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> bed wetting and soiling himself or on the floor when he had previously been able to use the toilet. The Mother brought A to see a play therapist, who apparently informed her that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> there was a lot of “dysregulation” in A and that A is “very high need” and needs a “high level of control due to his insecurities”. Subsequently, the Mother brought A to a second therapist in September 2023, as the first therapist apparently “did not want to be involved”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in the Summons application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Mother’s case was that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> she filed this application as A had been “severely and adversely affected by the changes caused by the behaviour of the Father and his family members following the commencement of [d]ivorce [p]roceedings, particularly the negative stoking”, and she wanted the appointed psychologist to<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (a) work with A “through his feelings and help him to manage” his dysregulation; (b) assess A and “determine if he has been destabilised and/or negatively affected” by exposure to the Father and his family; and (c) make recommendations for the Father’s access to A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father submitted that the application was another bid by the Mother to “entrench her position”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> over A’s care and control, and to reduce his access to A as the Mother was really unhappy with the Father for not parenting A “in the way that she wants”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Father objected to the psychological assessment of A because he took the view that the assessment “may cause short-term and long-term harm”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The Father also submitted that a psychologist’s report would not be helpful because A is extremely young, and it would be difficult to ascertain any factual causes for A’s mental or emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father denied that he or his parents had engaged in any “negative stoking” of A, or that A’s movements were restricted in his parents’ home during access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. In response to the Mother’s allegations that A started to behave differently due to the different treatment by the Father and his family members after divorce proceedings began, the Father pointed out that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> the Mother’s accounts of events from March 2023 onwards showed that any change in A’s behaviour may not have been due to the Father’s or his family member’s actions. The Mother claimed that A began to act up in March 2023, and in April 2023, she changed her work arrangements to pick A up earlier to spend more time with him. The Mother again adjusted her work schedule subsequently so she could spend more time with A, and A then started full-day school in mid-July 2023. She also stated that the Father’s time with A did not change much from February to June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father also denied that he had spoken negatively of the Mother to A, and had only said to A that “<em>papa can feed you”, “papa can shower you”</em> or “<em>you can stay at por por’s house”</em> or words to that effect. The Father highlighted that before the divorce proceedings, the Mother had been fine with A staying at his parents’ home, and with his parents and sister helping with A’s care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law regarding examination of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Section 28 of the FJA 2014 provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>In any proceedings before a Family Court involving the custody or welfare of a child or involving a person, the Court may, on the application of any party to those proceedings or on its own motion, appoint a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child or person (as the case may be) for the purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The accompanying subsidiary legislation is in rules 35 and 36 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“the FJR 2014”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<b><em>35.-</em></b>(<em>1</em>)     <em>Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action of proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>4</em>)     <em>Where a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional who is not appointed by the Court pursuant to an application under paragraph (1) examines or assesses the child, no evidence arising out of the examination or assessment may be adduced without the leave of the Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>36.</em></b>      <em>When considering any question relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to any child, the Court may, on its own motion and with a view to obtaining a report on the welfare of the child, direct that the child be examined or assessed by a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or has experience in matters relating to child welfare.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Purpose of appointing a child expert</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Welfare of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Before ordering a child to undergo an assessment pursuant to section 28 of the FJA 2014, the assessment must be for the “<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in”</em> the proceedings involving the custody or welfare of the child. Similarly, rules 35 and 36 of the FJR 2014 provide that the expert evidence must be required in determining questions relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Women’s Charter”) makes it clear that the <b>paramount</b> consideration in all custody, care and control proceedings is the welfare of the child. The expert evidence is just one factor to be taken into account and the judge is at liberty to depart from expert recommendations if, after considering <em>all</em> relevant factors, they are not deemed to be in the welfare of the child. Indeed, section 130 of the Women’s Charter provides that the judge is not bound to follow the advice of a person trained or experienced in child welfare, when determining questions relating to the custody, care and control of a child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“130</em>.     <em>When considering any question relating to the custody, or the care and control, of any child, the court is to, whenever it is practicable, have regard to the advice of a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or experienced in child welfare but is not bound to follow such advice.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The assessment of a child is not simply a fact-finding exercise but may be better described as a forensic one, in order to gain <em>expert</em> insight/evidence on issues which are relevant to the proceedings in which leave for such assessment is sought. It should therefore be clear why the expert evidence is required, and what questions it would answer, relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In child-related proceedings in the UK, the court’s permission is similarly required before a child may be medically or psychiatrically examined or otherwise assessed for the purposes of providing expert evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The UK Children and Families Act 2014 provides that such expert evidence must be<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> “<em>necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings justly</em>”; and includes several factors which the court should consider in deciding whether to give permission for the examination or expert evidence. Such factors include (a) the impact of the examination or assessment on the welfare of the child; (b) the issues to which the expert evidence would relate; (c) the questions which the court would require the expert to answer; (d) what other expert evidence is available; (e) whether evidence could be given by another person on the matters on which the expert would give evidence; (f) the impact on the timeline, duration and conduct of the proceedings; and (g) the cost of the expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the relevant legislation in the UK is worded differently from section 28 of the FJA 2014, the factors in the Children and Families Act 2014 provide a helpful reference when considering whether assessment of children should be ordered and whether expert evidence is required. In <em>L v. J</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4764-M.xml')\">[1999] SGHC 258</a>, which concerned the variation of access and allegations of abuse, the applicant produced two psychiatric reports to support her assertion that the respondent’s conduct had adversely affected the mental wellbeing of the children. The court found the children’s psychiatric reports “unnecessary” and stated that it was in the children’s interests to keep them out of the dispute between the parents as much as possible. The High Court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> parties in every case should first consider whether a psychiatric assessment can truly be in the interests of the child, taking into consideration that such an assessment may take a toll on a young child’s mind and “<em>exacerbate feelings of guilt, anxiety and fear arising from the break-up of the family”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> the “<em>best course of action in any custody and access dispute is for it to be resolved… without the children being taken to see any counsellor or psychiatrist at all. </em><b><em>Seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for an assessment in order for the custody and access disputes to be resolved (as opposed to seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for therapeutic purposes) may damage the child by enhancing his awareness of the dispute between his parents, making him acutely conscious that he is the center of this dispute, and giving him the idea that his responses may have some influence in this dispute, and that he must therefore bear some responsibility in respect of its outcome</em></b><em>.”</em> [emphasis is my own]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Thus, it should be asked whether such <em>expert</em> evidence is really necessary, or whether the information sought may be obtained through other means which are less intrusive to the child, for example, by instead conducting a judge-child interview, or by ordering a specific issues report which is conducted by a court family specialist from FJC’s Counselling and Psychological Services (“CAPS”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Any psychiatric or psychological assessment, while not involving a physical examination of the body, should nevertheless be treated as a medical intervention. Just as a parent would not hastily insist that a child undergo surgery with general anesthesia to repair a sprained ankle, similarly parents should not be so eager to offer up their children’s minds and thoughts to be dissected and picked over by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Divorcing parents should recognise that custody disputes do <b>not</b> warrant immediate psychological or psychiatric intervention for children without good reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Utility of assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is important to ascertain the questions to be answered by the expert evidence. If the information sought by the court can only be answered by an expert and is not merely factual, then an expert assessment may be required. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court found that the expert<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>“<em>must give an explanation which supplies the understanding of the subject which the court lacks</em>”. In <em>In re C (Fam D)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/77525-E.xml')\">[2024] 1 WLR 1</a>, it was stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> an allegation of whether a parent had alienated a child against the other parent was “<em>a question of fact for the court to resolve and not a diagnosis that can or should be offered by a psychologist</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In <em>UVM v. UVN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23230-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 56</a>, the court found that the purpose of rule 35 of the FJR 2014 was to “<em>ensure that a child is not subject to unnecessary psychological assessment which could of itself lead to issues of its own”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></em>. It was noted there that the psychological assessment was conducted when the child was aged 2 years 8 months, and it was doubtful whether the answers from, or any tests conducted on, such a young child would be reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the ages of 3 to 4, children’s speech and thinking are still in the early stages of development, and their use of speech and vocabulary is extremely limited. Their cognitive skills are not fully developed, and they may not be able to express themselves clearly. A is only 4 years old now, and it would be difficult to elicit information from him which is useful for the current proceedings, even with the assistance of a trained expert. The Mother herself admitted that she did not apply for a custody evaluation report (CER) or access evaluation report (AER) because she thought that being only 4 years old, A “<em>may not be able to express himself to a CER or AER officer</em>” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. The Mother has not shown how a trained psychologist or therapist would be in a better position to elicit more information from A than an AER or CER officer (who is usually a trained counsellor or social worker).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Not therapeutic or aimed at fault-finding or attributing blame</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It is also useful to look at the reasons for which a psychological assessment of a child should <b><u>not</u></b> be ordered. It is clear from <em>JBM v. JBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16706-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 429</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> that the court-ordered psychological assessment of children is <b>not</b> meant to be therapeutic or preventive in nature. For completeness, <em>JBM v. JBN</em> pre-dated section 28 of the FJA 2014 and concerned the equivalent rule 41 of the now-repealed Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R 4) (“the MPR”). Rule 41 of the MPR is the predecessor rule to rules 35-36 of the FJR 2014; and is drafted in a similar manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>After proceedings have been commenced under Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a party shall not, without the leave of court, cause a child to be examined or assessed by any psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor or other social work professional or mental health professional for the purpose of the preparation of expert evidence for use in the proceedings for ancillary relief involving the custody and welfare of the child.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s application sought to have the appointed child psychologist help to “<em>address and manage any negative feelings”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></em> A may have, and to “<em>ascertain the reasons for his distress”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></em>. In the specific prayers of the Mother’s amended Summons, it is stated that the psychological examination of A is for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”, to set out the “assessment of A’s mental and emotional state”, and whether he has been “destabilised/negatively affected because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>recommendations for the Defendant’s access to A in light of his/her findings above</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother goes on in the affidavits to state that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>a child psychologist needs to be appointed to assess [A] and to recommend the care arrangements moving forward since:</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take cognizance of any of the troubling evidence before him of [A]’s distress; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take into consideration my observations of [A] despite being his primary caregiver.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“I am genuinely concerned about </em> <em><u>the Defendant’s behaviour and the effect it has had on [A]</u></em> <em>.

It is clear, as explained above, that ordering a child to be assessed for the purposes of preparing expert evidence <b>cannot</b> be therapeutic in nature. If the court determines that a child in divorce proceedings requires therapeutic intervention for his/her trauma or distress, orders may be made for the child to undergo counselling or therapy, or, in serious cases, to see a psychiatrist/psychologist to undergo treatment. That is however very different from ordering a child to undergo assessment for the <em>purposes</em> of obtaining expert evidence to assist the court in answering questions that only an expert can. The former is ordered for the primary purpose of treating the child, and not for the determination of an outcome in custody proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     An application for a court-ordered assessment of a child must not be used as a means of blame-attributing or fault-finding on the part of one parent. The assessment must be an objective forensic exercise necessitated for the welfare of the child. The way the Mother’s prayers in the application are phrased, what she seeks to be determined is whether A has been negatively affected “<em>because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>” and for the expert to make recommendations for the Father’s access to A “<em>in light of his/her findings above</em>”. The proposed questions to be posed to the expert are also based on the premise or assumption that A’s current emotional state is due to the Father and/or his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, and are self-serving. Even if the questions posed to the expert are reframed from those sought in the Mother’s application, I am of the view that there is no need for expert evidence of this nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     What is important here is that we deal with the issue of how we can help A through this difficult adjustment period in his life, and not subject him to a psychological <em>assessment</em> for the purposes of determining how much access the Father should have. I do not think that the exact causes of A’s alleged dysregulation can be determined by an assessment, given A’s tender age and limited ability to express himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     After considering all the relevant factors, I am not convinced that it is necessary or in the best interests or welfare of A to order a psychological or therapeutic assessment to be undertaken. I also do not see the utility of the expert evidence sought to be ordered in this case. While I do not doubt that A has been experiencing changes such as waking up and crying in the middle of the night, temper tantrums and a certain amount of regression with respect to his toileting habits, it is important to understand the effects of divorce and parental conflict on a child of his age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A was only 3 years old when the divorce proceedings commenced. Children of this age are too young to fully understand and comprehend changes around them. They are extremely sensitive to changes in their routine and daily life and are unable to express themselves clearly. Young children are also very attuned to the moods and feelings of their caregivers and the people around them, and may react accordingly. If a parent whom the child is close to is anxious or upset, the child may mirror the emotions of the parent by crying or throwing tantrums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Effects of divorce on young children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is not unusual that A feels the stresses and impact of the divorce and custody proceedings; and is thus acting out or exhibiting regressive behaviour. Constant exposure to conflict and stressors can severely impact a child. Even the observation of conflict between parents is a direct stressor for children, and divorce is a “<em>summary variable that represents a variety of circumstances that many children experience as stressful</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     On the Family Assist website hosted by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, it is stated that a child aged 3-4 years, who is exposed to the conflict of divorce, may become “clingier and throws more tantrums by crying, screaming, or kicking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the learned District Judge opined that “<em>Children in a divorce situation may feel more sensitive to the presence or absence of a parent than children in a non-divorce situation. They may need more reassurance that the non-custodial parent is a constant presence in their lives, in order to feel secure.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Parents should also be aware of the “normal” changes a young child goes through as they are growing up, through different stages of their lives. It is not uncommon for a young child to regress in development sometimes due to growing pains, stressful stages of their lives or picking up on parents’ anxiety and trauma. Young children who have been toilet-trained may occasionally wet the bed, or wake up multiple times a night where previously they used to sleep through. How can one distinguish whether this is a phase of development, or whether the child has been truly traumatised and requires professional intervention?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     One would only have to perform a web search for “child regression” to find that thousands of books, perhaps more, have been written on this topic. This is probably because regression is a normal part of child development and is usually in reaction to a stressor. A change in caregivers, in school timings, in routine, can all be potential stressors for young children who are unable to verbalise accurately what they feel at the tender age of 4. As children develop and adapt to new surroundings, some form of regression may be expected. Highly sensitive children may be even more prone to regression as they have been shown to be more reactive to changes in their environment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Since the divorce proceedings were commenced in March 2023, the parties appeared to have engaged in one-upmanship behaviour where each was trying to show that they were the better parent, or spent more time with A. The Mother also admitted that around April 2023, she changed her work arrangements in order to pick A up from school earlier. While the Mother claimed that the Father had also disrupted A’s routine and schedule by picking A up early from school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>, she admitted that this was only done over a 2-week period. The Mother claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> A’s dysregulation was at its “peak” between 22 July and 11 August 2023. However, the Mother herself also took A out of school early, and this was evidenced in the correspondence dated 13 July 2023 from the Father’s then-solicitors to the Mother’s then-solicitors<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. During this period, the Father also claimed that the Mother had reduced his access to A, as she was picking A up from school or his parents’ home early. The parties’ conflict culminated in an incident on 24 August 2023, in the presence of A, where there was a physical altercation and the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order for herself, and a Domestic Exclusion Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is also undisputed that A started attending full-day school from July 2023 onwards, which is yet another change to his daily routine. In short, A had experienced, in the short span of just a few months, many major changes in his daily life. After the proceedings commenced, A saw less of the Father, the parties took turns to take him out of school early, and he then started full-day school. His routine and schedule also changed in that previously, after school, he would spend time at his paternal grandparents’ home and the Father would return early to play with him before the Mother brought him back to the matrimonial home. However, the Mother then started to bring him back to the matrimonial home earlier, so that he spent less time with the Father and his paternal grandparents. A was also present during the parties’ altercation on 24 August 2023. All these changes could very well cause A to feel extremely insecure and unmoored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The “negative stoking”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Mother’s evidence that the Father and his family members had been saying “negative” things about her to A consisted mainly of: (a) her observations of A saying certain things like<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> “<em>does not want to go home</em>, <em>you can stay at por por’s house, papa can take care of you, papa can feed you, papa can shower you, you don’t need stupid mama, you can sleep on papa’s bed, you can sleep with aunty xxx</em>, <em>mama wants to take papa away, please don’t take my papa away, mama please return my papa</em>”; and (b) her domestic helper C’s affidavit evidence. The Mother concluded that since A was only 3 years old at the time, he would not know how to say such things and would only say them if they had been “told to him in this manner”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother also relied on several transcripts of audio and video recordings, presumably to show the effects of the “negative stoking” on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“[00:47] Kid: Such a very hard day.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>[00:50] Woman: Such a very hard day, huh?

Even where A apparently tries to hit the Father or refuses him, and I note that these video recordings were taken in October 2023, these incidents occurred at the height of the parties’ acrimony when there were access disputes and multiple applications filed by parties. Given the upheaval in A’s life at this time, it is not unexpected that he would exhibit adjustment issues and act out. The Father has also pointed out that there was also evidence of the Mother saying negative things about him to A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>, such as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>You are scared to talk to your Papa is it? Why are you scared to talk to your Papa?</em>”<em>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It is clear from the very voluminous affidavits and multiple transcripts of recordings submitted by the Mother, that she harbours strong negative feelings against the Father. A young child’s emotional state can be significantly influenced by that of his primary caregiver. It is likely that A could have picked up on the Mother’s strong emotions against the Father, thus causing him to be clingier to the Mother. It is also possible that A is emotionally affected by the Father’s frustration at the restrictions placed on his access, and acts out due to confusion. I point this out because I do not think that it is possible for anyone to definitively point to the alleged “negative stoking” of A as the determinative factor for A’s dysregulation or regression; there could be many other factors contributing to A’s emotional state. What is clear to me is that, on a balance of probabilities, the very acrimonious relationship between the parties, their conflict and constant litigation is causing stress and confusion to A, and both parties have a part to play in this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the circumstances, while I dismiss the prayer for A to be examined by a psychologist or therapist for the purposes of preparing expert evidence in the proceedings, I recognise that there is a need for A to receive some intervention to help him to cope with the parties’ conflict and divorce. I therefore order the parties to <b>jointly</b> engage a play therapist for A, for the purposes of helping A to deal with the proceedings and the parties’ acrimonious relationship. A report is not required as the play therapy is not required for the purposes of expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Using video and audio recordings of children for proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I had on 16 January 2024 ordered that neither parent or their agent is to take audio or video recordings of A with the other parent, and save for exceptional circumstances, neither party is to submit any further audio or video recordings of A in affidavit. I had explained to both counsel that especially for young children such as A, repeatedly taking video or audio recordings of the child with one parent for the purposes of proceedings is extremely detrimental to the child’s welfare. I was concerned as the Mother had, in a supplementary affidavit filed earlier, adduced almost a hundred pages of transcriptions from video and audio recordings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. In the Mother’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she also adduced further evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> of more transcriptions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>VZZ v. WAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27115-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 11</a>, I had stated that in adducing evidence of multiple video and audio recordings, parties should really consider whether such evidence is really of assistance to the court, and more importantly, the impact of such recordings on the welfare of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. The High Court had also stated in <em>CLB v. CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27071-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 3</a> that photographs, video and/or audio recordings <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>“<em>are not always of assistance to the court – they may capture a moment (or several moments) in time</em>” but they do not capture events or interactions leading up to, or after, that particular moment. While such evidence may be relevant, it may carry weight that is “disproportionately prejudicial” to its relevance. Repeatedly photographing or filming children is also extremely intrusive and may constantly remind a child that he/she is being “used” in court proceedings. There is also the concern<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> of the possible impact of such recordings on the child in the long run: how would the child feel knowing that his/her past actions, behaviour and words were captured as evidence and used by one parent against the other? </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, I would remind both parents that while one parent may have interim care and control and the other parent has access, it is <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>“<em>erroneous and unhelpful to co-parenting for the parent with sole care and control to hold the view that he or she is the better or more important parent”</em>. It cannot be over-emphasised that effective joint or co-parenting is important in helping children to adjust to divorce and separation. As stated in <em>TAU v. TAT [</em>2018] 5 SLR 1089:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“While the parties take issue with each other’s parenting style, they must know that it is their divorce that has ultimately taken the greatest toll on the children. The parties’ acrimonious litigation and relationship have produced terrible effects on their children, psychologically, mentally, emotionally and even physically. The children are sandwiched between the parties. The adverse effects of the divorce on the children far outweigh the disadvantages of each parent’s parenting style.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     A is a vulnerable young child who is bearing the brunt of the divorce proceedings and litigation, and it is the joint responsibility of both the Father and the Mother to help him through this difficult time in his life. A child needs <em>both</em> parents to be involved in his life in order to thrive, and while it may be difficult for one parent to accept the other parent’s different parenting style, I urge both parties to set aside their grievances against each other and work together towards ensuring that A is happy and healthy.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the Mother’s affidavit in support of SUM 2985/2023 filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023 and paragraph 23 of the Mother’s Written Submissions filed on 24 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 23(d)-(e) of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 24 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 14 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 17 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 23 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 34 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 36 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraphs 36-37 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 112 of the Father’s Written Submissions filed on 21 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraphs 46-47 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraphs 35-39 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Paragraphs 78-82 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>See section 13(3) of the Children and Families Act 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>See section 13(6)-(7) of the Children and Families Act 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>[6] of <em>L v.

SUM 1631/2024 (“SUM 1631”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1632/2024 (“SUM 1632”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. My substantive decision in respect of both SUM 1631 and 1632 can be found in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Helena Amolak (“Ms Amolak”) argues that there should be no order as to costs for two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       First, that both parties had equally succeeded in their respective applications – if one applies the trite principle that costs follow the event, this would effectively mean that the costs which the Husband was entitled to in respect of his own application would be cancelled out by the costs he would have to pay in respect of the Wife’s application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Second, there was a moderately high degree of acrimony between the parties. In particular, Ms Amolak highlights the dispute between the Husband and the Wife over care and control and access to the children, and the extensive litigation that had taken place. There was thus ample reason, according to Ms Amolak who cited the High Court decision in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), to make no order as to costs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Mr Jevan Li (“Mr Li”), who represented the Wife, took a different view as to costs. He argued that the Husband should be ordered to pay costs of $1200 for SUM 1631. As for SUM 1632, the Wife should be ordered to pay costs of $300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Mr Li justifies the sums sought on the basis that SUM 1631 was the more contested and complex summons as more time was spent on this summons at the hearing compared to SUM 1632. Mr Li also highlights that more work was done in respect of SUM 1631 as compared to SUM 1632.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, this is an appropriate case in which to apply the principles laid down in <em>JBB</em>. I agree with Ms Amolak that there is indeed much acrimony between the parties which has had an impact on their two daughters. That much is clear to me from the various documents and reports on the record. I consider that making any award of costs in this case could well, as Ms Amolak points out,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> sow further discontent between the parties and potentially have a negative impact on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       There shall therefore be no order as to costs for both SUM 1631 and 1632.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at paras 4 – 8 and 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Probate – Validity of will – Forgery – Conflicting handwriting analysis"],"date":"2024-07-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/S 16/2020","title":"WZJ v WZK and another","citation":"[2024] SGFC 49","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31850-SSP.xml","counsel":["Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants."],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>WZJ v WZK and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZJ <em>v</em> WZK and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31850-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 49</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/S 16/2020</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">29 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff; Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZJ — WZK — WZL </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Probate</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Validity of will</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Forgery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Conflicting handwriting analysis</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">29 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The central issue in this case is the validity of a will which was executed in Malaysia (<em>Malaysian will</em>) about 7 months after the testator executed one in Singapore (<em>Singapore will</em>). The testator passed away on 20 October 2019 and very soon after, there was chaotic engagement amongst family members on the validity of the Malaysian will and who should rightfully benefit from the estate of the deceased. Such engagement involved various allegations made by family members against each other including what each believed would be the intentions of the deceased based on the tenor of his relationship with each member during his lifetime. The plaintiff is the son of the deceased. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the eldest daughter of the deceased while the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a lady who lived with the deceased in Malaysia for some time prior to the latter’s demise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Having heard the matter, I found for the plaintiff and declared the Malaysian will invalid. I ordered that probate be granted based on the Singapore will instead. I however dismissed the plaintiff’s application for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be removed as executor of the Singapore will and similarly dismissed the plaintiff’s application for letters of administration with the Singapore will annexed to be granted to him (or in the alternative, that he be appointed as the sole executor). The counterclaim was dismissed in its entirety. As parties could not agree on costs, I ordered costs of $90 000 (all in) to be paid by the defendants jointly and severally. The parties appeal against the substantive orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The deceased and his wife were divorced in 2005 and appear to have shared a cordial relationship after the divorce. From the union there are 3 children; 2 daughters and a son. As referenced above, the plaintiff is the deceased’s son, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is his eldest child and daughter. The other daughter will be referred to as the younger daughter for purposes of these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that the deceased executed his first will in August 2016 which left all his assets to his brother. It was also not disputed that the deceased then executed a will on 30 May 2017 in Singapore which effectively revoked the August 2016 will. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant suggested that the deceased was influenced by his other 2 children and their mother into executing the Singapore will. The will names the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor and trustee and the plaintiff as the subsititute executor if one of many listed events were to occur. Under the Singapore will, the estate of the deceased was to be divided equally amongst his 3 children. At the time the Singapore will was executed, the deceased was living in his ex-wife’s home to enable assistance for his medical appointments in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The deceased unfortunately suffered a heart attack sometime in June 2017 and was admitted to a Singapore hospital. After his discharge, he stayed with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at her home. It was the plaintiff’s position that the deceased was asked by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to leave her residence and he then lived in Johor from December 2017. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant stated that she did not ask that her father leave.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In any event, a third will dated 28 December 2017 was claimed by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to have been executed by the deceased in Malaysia. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as the executor and trustee and the beneficiaries of the estate are the deceased’s 2 grandsons. These are the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is not disputed that the defendants are close friends. It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position however that she only knew of the existence of the Malaysian will when informed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 8 November 2019. On 16 November 2019 the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant showed the Malaysian will to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who then claimed to have returned it and not to have taken note of the contents of the will save for the fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as executor and trustee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although there was communication between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and her mother on the existence of the Malaysian will in early December 2019, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant proceeded to file an application for probate in January 2020 based on the Singapore will. She claimed that she acted in this way as she felt pressure from her mother and siblings. Further, she claimed that she was not legally trained to understand the significance of acting in the way she did.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The validity of the Singapore will</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is trite law that the burden of propounding a will lies in every case upon the party propounding the will (<b><em>ULV v ULW)</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Section 5 and 6 of the Wills Act (1838) provide the rules for the formal validity of wills and the mode of execution, respectively. The Singapore will was properly executed. There was no allegation of a lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Both the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant together with their mother were present when the deceased executed the will in his lawyer’s office in Singapore. Its execution was in the presence of 2 witnesses, one of whom was the deceased’s lawyer (<em>the Singapore lawyer</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Although there was suggestion by the 1st defendant that the Singapore will was executed under the influence of her mother and siblings, this was not a challenge that she robustly pursued. It would also be rather odd that the 1st defendant was named as the executor and equal beneficiary, if there were such influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the Malaysian will was rejected </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     After the divorce between the deceased and his wife in 2005, the 2nd defendant stated that she came to know the deceased. She was an administrative staff member at one of the deceased’s companies from 2009.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It was her evidence that the deceased lived in a house in Johor more permanently from 2013 or 2014<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and travelled to Singapore during the weekends. She also said that she looked after him in Malaysia. In fact, she was present in the house when the deceased was found dead in the early morning of 20 October 2019 when she woke up from sleep. He was found only in underclothes and remained in that state on the floor of the home till the ambulance arrived. The plaintiff and other family members expressed their unhappiness at finding the deceased in such a state and pointed to a lack of care by the 2nd defendant whether fairly or otherwise, in taking care of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was the 2nd defendant’s evidence that the deceased went to a lawyer’s office in Malaysia to execute the Malaysian will on 28 December 2017. She claimed that she was present in the room when the deceased executed the will. She was named as executor and trustee. The execution of the will was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer and a former driver of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The deceased had assets in Singapore and Malaysia, including immoveable properties and businesses. Three of these businesses were named after the plaintiff perhaps suggesting a sense of closeness to his son. The Malaysian will however made reference to specific Malaysian assets while only referring generally to all other assets in the name of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(i) The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the witnesses to the execution of the Malaysian will could not be safely relied on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was the 2nd defendant’s position that the reason why there was a sudden change of heart on the part of the deceased leading him to revoke the Singapore will was because the plaintiff stole the title deeds to the deceased’s Malaysian properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This was disputed by the plaintiff who claimed that his father had told him on numerous occasions that the same Malaysian lawyer who had apparently drafted and witnessed the Malaysian will could not be trusted and that the lawyer had taken the title deeds to one of his properties and had sold the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The plaintiff had also stated that the deceased had on one occasion, asked his children whether he should lend S$35 000 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for a coffee shop business. Only the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in favour of this. The money was lent and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant engaged the Malaysian lawyer to assist in setting up the business. The business never materialised and the money unaccounted for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The suggestion from the plaintiff was that the Malaysian lawyer and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant cannot be trusted. In my view, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is to be believed on her position that the deceased was unhappy with the plaintiff thus prompting him to make a new will with the assistance of the Malaysian lawyer, why would his other children be removed from benefitting from his estate. His unhappiness was only with the plaintiff. I accepted the plaintiff’s position that there was much more that appears to have transpired between the deceased and the Malaysian lawyer in the past and between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the Malaysian lawyer which makes the Malaysian will a document that required further scrutiny.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is also in my view unbelievable as there was no reason for her to omit to inform the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant about the Malaysian will until the deceased had passed away almost 2 years later. They were both close and supportive of each other. It is more likely that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant always knew of the Malaysian will and not as she claimed, only in November 2019. In fact under cross-examination the Malaysian lawyer met with the plaintiff and his mother on 6 November 2019 but informed them that he did not have a copy of the Malaysian will with him. Soon after the visit, the Malaysian lawyer claimed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant informed him that she had given it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the latter arriving at the Malaysian lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 already having with her a copy of the will. Even at this point, knowing that the plaintiff wanted a copy of it, the Malaysian lawyer did not retain a copy nor inform the plaintiff that he was in possession of it. To complicate matters even further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under cross – examination denied passing it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also claimed that she never brought the Malaysian will to the Malaysian lawyer on 13 November 2019 and insisted that the Malaysian lawyer was mistaken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian will did not rather strangely, appoint the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor of the will (as was the case in the Singapore will) even though the impression created by both defendants was that the relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the deceased was extremely good.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While the Malaysian will is dramatically different from the Singapore will insofar as it relates to the beneficiaries named, the deceased did not choose to change his nomination for his CPF money which mirrored the distribution of assets in his Singapore will. If the deceased was so angry with the plaintiff that he chose to change his will to provide only for his grandsons, that anger did not find expression in the way his CPF money was to be distributed. This raises concerns with the evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on the reason why the deceased wanted to remove the plaintiff from his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There are in my view large concerns with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer and the second witness to the will. The plaintiff had consistently and vehemently insisted that the deceased had informed him that the Malaysian lawyer could not be trusted. This was echoed by his younger sister on finding out from the plaintiff that there was possibly a Malaysian will that was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> An aunt of the plaintiff and his siblings who lived in Johor since 2017 and visited the deceased often, stated that she was told by the deceased that he had executed a will that distributed his estate equally amongst his children. There was never any mention otherwise including any conversation that revealed that he had gone to a Malaysian lawyer to execute another will. In particular, the deceased never spoke of leaving anything to his grandchildren.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The aunt in fact shared that the deceased said that he would give a little more to the plaintiff and his younger daughter when he spoke of specific properties in Singapore and Malaysia as he felt that he had already provided more to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The aunt was not shown to have any greater affiliation to the plaintiff. Another witness lent force to the plaintiff’s narrative. A former driver of the deceased<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> who served him from 2017 till he passed on, spoke of having driven him to many places in Singapore and Malaysia. This included places where the deceased would meet the plaintiff and his younger sister, to the ex-wife’s home and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s home, suggesting that the deceased maintained a cordial relationship with all the family members even if there may have been challenges over the years. This former driver said that he was never asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. He also shared how the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s husband asked for a share of the deceased’s estate to be given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the latter had taken care of the deceased prior to his passing. There was no reason to doubt this piece of evidence which was also spoken of by the plaintiff and his mother and which transpired a few days after the passing of the deceased. It would be odd to have the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant provided for from the estate of the deceased when this was not in the Malaysian will. There are many possible reasons why the Malaysian will does not provide for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. One is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was promised a sum of money by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and possibly the latter’s husband if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would claim that such a will existed which would leave everything to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s children without drawing attention to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have wanted to distance herself from the Malaysian will which would at some point have to surface if it were to govern distribution of the deceased’s estate as she knew her siblings would be suspicious. By having the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant stated as the executor and trustee while enabling the only beneficiaries to be the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant prevented any attack or suspicion of the motives of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The question remains - was the will in fact a forged document? I found that the Malaysian will was in all probability a product of an attempt to deny the children of the deceased an equal share in the estate of the deceased and was not executed by the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The evidence of the two witnesses to the will was rife with irregularities and inconsistencies. The Malaysian lawyer claimed he had handled many legal matters for the deceased whom he had known for decades. He described the relationship between the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as close.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He went on to inform that the deceased executed the Malaysian will with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant present and that the deceased signed with him and another individual as witnesses. This second witness he first described as a “Malay guy” and only later when prodded during cross-examination, as a former driver of the deceased. In his affidavit, he claimed that he informed the plaintiff of the second witness but in court under cross-examination, he claimed that he did not tell the plaintiff who the witnesses of the Malaysian will were. There was no reason why he would not have if a will was executed. Under cross-examination he eventually confirmed that his affidavit was correct and that he did tell the plaintiff about the witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Malaysian lawyer went on to say that “<em>my former client informed me that he wanted to impress his thumbprint on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will as well</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It was the plaintiff’s case that the deceased never used his thumbprint on documents. No document other than the Malaysian will was produced to show that the deceased had a pattern of affixing his thumbprint together with his signature. The Malaysian lawyer who had apparently acted for him on various legal matters over the years did not ask why the deceased felt the need to do this. The plaintiff had given in evidence that he had seen the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant removing the cloth that was placed over the deceased’s body during the wake and on being asked why, she tried to distract from this. It was the suggestion of the plaintiff therefore that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have used the thumbprint of the deceased as he lay dead, on this Malaysian will. While truth may sometimes be stranger than fiction, I found no evidence to corroborate this. An attempt to forensically examine the thumbprint did not point to any conclusion. I did accept however that it was unusual that the deceased would have affixed his thumbprint on the Malaysian will when this was not his practice. More relevant is the fact that this was not done for the Singapore will 7 months before the Malaysian will nor the insurance forms which was signed 9 months after the Malaysian will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was of concern in another material way. He claimed to have been asked by the deceased to prepare his will. It is unclear whether the lawyer informed him of the need for a second witness or if it was the deceased himself who decided on bringing his driver to be his witness. The lawyer claimed to have prepared the will. Yet he did not have a copy of it when asked by the plaintiff for it. He stated that he gave both the original signed will and a copy, to the deceased. The Malaysian lawyer was not merely a witness to the execution of the will. In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> v <b><em>The Bank of East Asia Ltd</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> the lack of notes or retention of a copy of a will were not seen as detrimental if the lawyer was only a witness. It is certainly different if he prepared the will in his professional capacity. This may of course be a lapse in professional judgment but one of the reasons the lawyer gave in evidence for the deceased having approached him instead of a lawyer in Singapore was that it was cheaper to get it done in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He knew he was acting in his professional capacity and what his duties were given his vast experience in matters of this nature. No good reason was offered for not having kept a copy of a will drafted by him as a lawyer. Unlike the Singapore will, it was also not registered at a wills registry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     When pressed by the plaintiff for a copy of the will on 6 November 2019, the Malaysian lawyer provided an unsigned copy to the plaintiff saying that he managed to get that from a saved soft copy. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that the Malaysian lawyer told him that the deceased did attend at his office but never signed the will. Given that there was no signed copy retained, this was probable. It was also the evidence of the plaintiff that the lawyer informed him that cultural norms dictated that the only son of the deceased should inherit the estate and that if he wanted to, he could take steps to have that done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> This astonishing evidence if true has far reaching professional consequences for the lawyer. What is clear however is that no signed copy of the Malaysian will was retained by the Malaysian lawyer. The evidence of the plaintiff that he was informed by the Malaysian lawyer that S$25 000 was owed to him by the deceased for corporate taxes seems to find support in the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant herself who said she approached the lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 (after she came to know of the existence of the Malaysian will) as she was informed that there were tax in arrears as well as another debt that their father owed. There is also evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had wanted payments to be made to the Malaysian lawyer towards taxes in arrears.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian lawyer’s motive is unclear but the evidence of the plaintiff was compelling in its suggestion that the Malaysian lawyer conducted his matters in a rather casual way, without proper records. Even his answers to questions in court were rather insouciant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness in the larger context of the Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was troubling as well. He claimed to have met the deceased in Malaysia when he was out of work. He was employed by the deceased as his driver. He worked for the deceased for about a year. Thereafter, he left to work in Singapore for about 2 years and claimed to have worked for the deceased again in early 2017. He was not clear of which month in 2017 he ceased employment. He stated that he had driven the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the Malaysian lawyer’s office on many occasions. Under cross-examination, when asked who prepared his affidavit, he stated that it was the Malaysian lawyer. When asked to clarify whether he dictated the contents to the Malaysian lawyer, he said that it was in fact completely prepared by the lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer and that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will are very similar. Given that the witnesses to the Malaysian will were both called to give evidence, the drafting of the affidavit by the Malaysian lawyer for the second witness was inappropriate. The second witness under cross-examination, was also unable to identify the ex-wife and the children of the deceased accurately but insisted in his affidavit that he was told by the deceased that the plaintiff and his younger daughter were greedy, and that his grandsons of his older daughter “deserved” to inherit his estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>Such remarks crafted by the Malaysian lawyer and not coming from the witness himself was troubling. I noted as well that he had broken down in tears when asked about the will. He seemed very nervous which can be expected in court proceedings, but the degree of his anxiety in answering the question of whether he witnessed the execution of the will by the deceased was concerning. He claimed that he was just emotional thinking of the deceased who was like a father to him. This however, together with the parroting of evidence of the Malaysian lawyer in his affidavit especially when he is not fluent in English throws up concerns about the truthfulness of what was being said. It bears repeating that it was the evidence of the new driver who started to work for the deceased sometime in 2017 as well that he had never been asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. This was at odds with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer that the deceased approached the lawyer for many matters over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(ii) Evidence and conduct of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is somewhat incongruent with human nature for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was surprised on being told by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that there was a Malaysian will, not to have asked more about it nor about the contents. This is so given that the defendants were close, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was months ago seated in a Singapore law office aware that her father wanted her to be the executor of his will. Upon finally receiving the Malaysian will from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, she did not share it with her birth family knowing that they were no longer beneficiaries. Even if she were not curious and resisted the temptation of finding out if she was to benefit from the Malaysian will just as she was to have benefitted from the Singapore will, why did she not take immediate steps to be transparent with her mother and siblings upon finding out about the Malaysian will? It did not occur to her somewhat odd as well that despite her consistent evidence of being in a very close relationship with her father, she was so quickly removed as the executor of the Malaysian will. Even when she met her mother and the plaintiff on a flight to India by chance, she showed a picture of the will that appeared on her mobile phone and not the details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     While she knew that the Singapore will had apparently been superseded by the Malaysian will, she chose to apply for probate in Singapore based on the Singapore will. The application has been granted but the grant has not been issued. It was the plaintiff and his younger sister’s position that she had not done so as her demands for payment to be made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not agreed to by them nor their mother. This appears to have prompted her to stop the Singapore proceedings. I do not accept that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant chose not to extract the order simply because she was suddenly of the view that she should honour the later Malaysian will and no longer felt any pressure by her siblings to accept the Singapore will. Her insistence as well that she would gain nothing from the Malaysian will was to draw an artificial line between gaining directly from her father’s estate and indirectly through her children. The plaintiff’s insistence that the Malaysian will be forwarded for handwriting analysis made relations strained. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she felt pressured to apply for probate on the Singapore will is hard to appreciate because she had legal counsel, and she did not feel similar pressure when she eventually aborted the proceedings. It was in fact the Singapore lawyer’s evidence that he was not informed of a Malaysian will. On being told that, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant changed her initial position on having told her counsel of this to the position that he only knew there were Malaysian properties, and she was told that she could proceed to do the needful in Malaysia after getting probate in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she was very close to the deceased, especially having taken care of him in her house for a period, while the plaintiff was not. From the evidence collectively it appeared that the deceased’s relationship with his ex-wife and all his children had its challenges at times. I could not find any evidence that he was close to one child to the exclusion of the others. In any event, who he chose to leave his wealth to may have nothing to do with whether he was close to an individual or not. If that were the case, he would have likely left something for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant went on to say that the deceased was also very close to her sons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> suggesting that it should not surprise anyone in the family that her father left his estate to them. What is of significance is that although she never knew the existence of the will until after the deceased had passed on nor was she curious about its contents when first told, she stated in her affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…<em>my father impressed his signature on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will to avoid any ambiguity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In my view, her position that the deceased must have done so to avoid ambiguity is not something a person absent at the execution would be able to categorically say. Unless of course, she knew this from those who were present. Yet she claims that even her close friend, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant simply told her about the existence of the will in the month after the passing of the deceased. Further, why would there be a need to be concerned about ambiguity given that there were 2 witnesses? The Singapore will executed 7 months prior did not have a thumbprint and the deceased never executed documents this way in the past. Any position that his hands were weak and may tremble on writing was not accepted considering the history of the way the deceased acted and very specifically, the fact that he had signed on insurance documents in 2018 without the need to affix his thumbprint. These documents were handed to the plaintiff by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant when the plaintiff arrived at the deceased’s home after the latter’s passing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The defendants’ counsel submitted that the issue of the thumbprint was raised by the plaintiff only in their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1), thereby causing prejudice to the defendants and would need to be treated as fatal to the plaintiff’s case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The reference in the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) was clearly in reply to paragraph 46 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) which referred to the thumbprint having been affixed to “<em>avoid any debate as to the validity of the will</em>”. In any event, the defendants’ case cannot be said to have been prejudiced as leave of court to address this could have been sought if felt to be material. What is clear is that as a matter of practice, the deceased never affixed his thumbprint, and this formed the roots of the plaintiff’s position on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reliance on forensic handwriting analysis – to what extent?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With advancements in technology, the contribution of experts in handwriting analysis has been very helpful in the determination of many issues before the courts, be it criminal, civil or family matters. And much like any other science, there is often conflict in opinion. It is the responsibility of a court where there is such conflict to decide if the methodologies and equipment used has produced a more robust and hence more reliable conclusion by one expert as compared to another. In some cases, of course, both may be limited such that it would be safer to turn to evidence other than the conclusions drawn by the expert witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The plaintiff called on an expert who has about 23 years of experience and has given evidence in many trials prior to this one. He was provided a copy of the Malaysian will where 2 signatures (Q1 and Q2) are found. He was also given 3 specimens (S1-S3) which he did not consider to be good specimen as they contained signatures that were made by the deceased in 2013. He informed in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> that signatures done many years ago would not provide for a fair comparison. He went on to compare Q1 and Q2 with the signature of the deceased found on the insurance forms which sought disability benefits. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant appears to have filled out this form for the deceased. This specimen (S4-1 to S4-5) were signed on 1 September 2018 (i.e. 9 months after the Malaysian will of December 2017). As mentioned previously, this specimen also does not bear the thumbprint of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Having highlighted the similarities in the signatures found on the Malaysian will and the specimen document S4 which he pointed out showed a moderate range of variation, he went on to elaborate on the significant differences which lent to his conclusion that there is “strong support” that the person who signed on Q1 and Q2 <b>is not</b> the same person who signed on S4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> One of the limitations under which the expert worked however is the fact that only a copy of the Malaysian will was handed to the expert. This prevented stereomicroscopic comparative examination of the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     After his evidence was given, the defendants’ counsel called on an expert. The decision to call this expert came after hearing dates were taken which impacted to some degree, the preparation of the plaintiff’s case. I allowed the application regardless but allowed the plaintiff’s expert a right to respond. The defendants’ expert has 40 years of experience and similarly, has experience in giving evidence in court proceedings. This expert had the benefit of the original Malaysian will, the specimens S1 to S4 and the Singapore will (S5).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     She opined that the signatures in 2017 and 2018, the wills and the insurance company forms, respectively <em>“showed unsteady pen movement and angular and less fluently made curves</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> She also stated that signatures that were made on the same day also showed significant inconsistencies. She put it down to natural variation. She also gave in evidence that Q1 and Q2 showed no hesitation and stiffness in pen movement and no laboured drawing and re-touching of strokes which are associated with manual copying or stimulations. She was of the view that no tracing had been done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> She compared S4 (just as the plaintiff’s expert did) and S5 (the Singapore will) with Q1 and Q2. She commented that the design, size, pen movement and stroke fluency were similar to the natural variation in S4 and S5. In other words, I must first accept that the variations seen in the specimen documents are natural variations. I had no reason to doubt it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The expert for the defendants believed the deceased “<b>probably” signed</b> the Malaysian will. This is a conclusion that is less than certain. In the range of certainty, the highest certainty levels would be if the signatures in Q1 and Q 2 are referred to as “is written by” or “it is highly probable written by”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The expert also made a few observations about the analysis of the plaintiff’s expert. She pointed out what was already expressed as a limitation by the plaintiff’s expert, that is, that the original Malaysian will was not provided. She then went on to disagree with the description of a particular slant that appeared on the signatures in S4-5. She further disagreed with the plaintiff’s expert that there was a clear “pen lift” in Q2. She made in my view unfortunately, a comment on the plaintiff’s expert’s carelessness in that there were typographical errors, a wrongly labelled image and wrong paragraphing in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> which I do not believe reduces the weight that can be attributed to his core work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given that the defendants called on their witness late in the day, I gave the opportunity for the plaintiff’s expert to file a supplementary affidavit after examining the original Malaysian will and the Singapore will. He was able to conduct a stereomicroscopic comparative examination. He concluded again that the <b>author of the questioned documents was not the author of the specimens in S4 and S5</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The affidavit of another handwriting analyst engaged by the plaintiff and who resides in India was filed. He did not attend proceedings and was not subject to cross-examination and hence I ascribed no value to the same. He shared the opinion of the expert of the plaintiff who did attend these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given that the core issue in this case was the validity of the Malaysian will, parties were encouraged during a case conference to consider jointly engaging an expert to analyse the signatures on the Malaysian will with the hope that matters would then be resolved amicably. Much disagreement arose on the scope of the engagement for the analysis to be done by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). When parties finally agreed and a report appears to have been produced, the plaintiff chose not to rely on it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Section 116 (g) of the Evidence Act (1893) provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>“<em>The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks is likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>By way of illustration the section provides that the court can presume that evidence which could be produced but is not would if produced have been unfavourable to the person who withholds it. Relying on the legislative provision and referring to the case of <b><em>Harmony Shipping CO.S.A</em></b><b>.</b> v. <b><em>Saudi Europe Line Ltd</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> the defendants’ counsel urged the court to accept that the HSA report was unfavourable to the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The court in <b><em>Harmony Shipping</em></b> however was referring generally to witnesses of fact and the rule that there is no property in a witness. The defendants were invited to consider applying for the production of the HSA report but during a case conference on 2 May 2023, the defendants’ counsel had confirmed that his clients did not intend to seek production of the report. Further, even as the defendants’ were of the view that the plaintiff was “expert shopping” in relying on the report that was in fact produced and omitting the HSA report, they did essentially the same by calling on their expert so close to the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> the court was of the view that it should not speculate on what any withheld evidence may contain or be. What then were the circumstances in the case before me which prevented an adverse inference? Litigation privilege is one of 2 aspects of legal professional privilege, the other being legal advice privilege. The plaintiff relied on litigation privilege by satisfying the court that there had been a reasonable prospect of litigation, and the communications/document were for the dominant purpose of litigation. Litigation privilege applies to expert witnesses. The defendants were additionally not prejudiced by the omission to produce the report. The 2 reports, from qualified local experts with sound knowledge and utilisation of accepted methods of analysis were in conflict, highlighting the tremendous challenge in relying on handwriting analysis in this case. In any event, as stated above, there was nothing limiting the defendants from applying to produce the HSA report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In light of the fact that the reports that were submitted to court contained differing conclusions and given especially that the experts themselves could not categorise their conclusions with the highest certainty level, I chose to look at all the other evidence instead of relying on the handwriting analysis in making my determination. While handwriting analysis as a growing science is certainly helpful, it remains equally very much an art allowing for different interpretations of the same documents. In some cases, like this one, it would in my view be unsafe to select one over the other in deciding the central issue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was allowed to continue as executor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having found that the Singapore will was the last valid will, I considered the application by the plaintiff for letters of administration (with will annexed) to be granted to him or in the alternative, for an amendment to the grant appointing the plaintiff instead of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The alternative prayer was not feasible given that the Singapore will provide only specific situations where substitution could occur and none of the events had transpired. The closest reference to enable substitution was in the event the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could not take care of “her” affairs as distinct from the estate affairs. Even if the request is based on the position that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is unfit to act as executor, the court cannot go beyond the intentions of the testator. Further, there can be no amendment to the grant of probate as no grant has been made. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant aborted proceedings once an order in terms of the application had been obtained, short of the actual grant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I also dismissed the application by the plaintiff to apply for letters of administration (with will annexed). While there is in my view sufficient evidence to conclude that the deceased could not have executed the Malaysian will, I could not conclude with a high level of certainty as to the extent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s involvement in this. While there was clearly evidence that she knew of the existence of the Malaysian will, the level of her culpability or knowledge that the deceased never properly executed the Malaysian will would require some conjecture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s application for probate in Singapore, the order has been made. Further, the assets of the deceased are known, and the matter can be completed quickly enabling the shares of the beneficiaries to be received. It was the plaintiff’s submission<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> that since the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had proceeded to apply for a grant seeking to propound the Singapore will when she knew of the Malaysian will and had breached her fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, she should be removed as executor with the plaintiff stepping in instead. The reference to s 32 of the Probate and Administration Act (1934)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> would be misplaced as a grant has not yet been made. Section 32 refers to the revocation of grants and not setting aside orders made, as is the case here. Additionally, both executors and trustees owe fiduciary duties to beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate in relation to the administration of his estate. An executor essentially “calls in the estate” and ensures that the assets are converted into cash and pays off all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When he has done that, his duties as an executor are discharged. As she moves to fill in the shoes of a trustee, he owes a set of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries including the important duty of keeping and providing accounts to the beneficiaries (<b><em>Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another</em></b> v <b><em>Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff and his younger sister can hold the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant accountable for the proper administration of the estate including the duty to account which is a continuing one. There has yet to be a grant of probate – once issued, this would usher in the duties of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as executor and trustee. There is no need to unwind the steps already taken in these proceedings given the ability of the beneficiaries to monitor and insist that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant remain accountable to them as the person their father trusted to execute his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The outcome of this litigation was in the plaintiff’s favour. Essentially the plaintiff had been successful in proving that the last valid will of his father was the one executed in Singapore. The fact that I did not enable him to take over the administration of the estate from his sister does not make him the unsuccessful party. The central issue was determined in his favour and he should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Costs are in the discretion of the court and reference was made to Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (2021). I gave parties ample time to agree on costs, but they were unable to do so. The hearing took 6 days. Despite numerous case conferences before the matter was fixed, the defendants chose to indicate that they wished to call an expert handwriting analyst some 10 days before the commencement of the hearing, having already known of the nature of the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert. The matter was not simple and there were many witnesses of fact called by the plaintiff to provide evidence. A cost order reflective of the complexity and effort expended was necessary. The sum of $90 000 (all in) was felt to be a fair amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I ordered that the defendants be jointly and severally responsible for the costs as they participated in material albeit different ways to this litigation, which certainly could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this case, family members knew that a will had been left by their father to govern the distribution of his estate on his passing. Any information that is known by one or more persons that there may be yet another later will must be shared regardless of any concern about how it would be received or accepted. Any lack of transparency does not lend trust as to its authenticity. It also fuels frustration, disappointment, anger and unnecessary costs fighting each other in a courtroom. The money that these parties fought over was never money that was theirs in the first place. It was a gift. It was never to have them destroy relationships but to instead come together in their father’s memory with an even stronger tone to their relationships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The defendants were not honest and transparent in their dealings with the plaintiff and the larger family and it has occasioned this litigation and caused a great rift between them. Family in probate proceedings should be mindful of the unnecessary burden they place on generations after them from disputes of this nature.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 196 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22704-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 2</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Affidavit of 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 39.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 28 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcripts (Day 3) at pages 227 to 229, 232 to 234 and (Day 4) at pages 204 to 207.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 29 of the sister’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 20 of the plaintiff’s aunt’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>For clarity this is not the same driver who acted as a second witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 23 of affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 70 of affidavit of 20 April 2022 and Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 260-261.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19733-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 66</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 197, 20-221.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of the affidavit of the plaintiff dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Paragraphs 178-179 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Transcript (Day 4) at page 11, lines 8 to 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Paragraphs 26-28 of the affidavit dated 20 April 2022 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>Certified transcript (Day 2) pages 13 to 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 137.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>Paragraph 59 of defendants’ submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>Fancini, Simone Ling, “Expert Handwriting Testimony: Is the Writing Really on the Wall?” 11 Suffolk J.

My decision in respect of SUM 1739 and SUM 1684, which were the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, can be found in <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband argues that there should be no order as to costs The broad thrust of his argument is that if one proceeds on the well-established rule that costs should follow the event, although the Wife may be entitled to costs in SUM 1739, the Husband should be entitled to costs of SUM 1684. The costs ordered in either application would offset each other – effectively, there would be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, argued that because the Wife had succeeded in obtaining orders for discovery, she should be entitled to costs. In doing so, counsel for the Wife relies on the starting position that costs should follow the event. Counsel for the Wife further argues that there are no facts which warrant a departure from this starting point. In fact, they say that the Husband’s conduct further justifies why he should be ordered to bear costs. In particular, counsel for the Wife highlights that the Husband had unreasonably denied their requests for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for the Wife’s application for interrogatories, counsel for the Wife appears to take the position, though they do not explicitly say so, that if one applies the rule the costs follow the event, it is the Husband who should be entitled to costs because the Wife had only obtained orders in respect of one part of the four interrogatories which she had sought. That said, the Husband’s conduct justifies departing from the starting point – this is because the Husband had unreasonably refused to answer the voluntary interrogatories which the Wife had posed to him. The end result is that the Husband should also be ordered to pay the Wife costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As to the quantum of costs, counsel for the Wife submitted that costs for both applications should be fixed at $3815 ($3500 as legal costs and $315 as GST).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The starting point insofar as costs are concerned, is that costs should indeed follow the event. The Wife has succeeded in her application for discovery in SUM 1739. She should therefore be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As for the quantum of such costs, I considered the fact that the application for discovery only concerned one item and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also considered the reasonableness of the Husband’s objections to the Wife’s requests for these documents at the voluntary disclosure stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband had resisted disclosure on the basis that the request was not relevant, necessary or reasonable for the fair disposal of the ancillary matters, and that the Wife’s requests were: a) broad and oppressive and amounted to fishing and b) that she had not provided any adequate reason to justify the documents requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s objections must be viewed in light of the Wife’s request. In her request dated 6 March 2024, she states that these documents relate to the Husband’s “means, earning capacity, the pool of matrimonial assets and dissipation of matrimonial assets”. It is clear, from this, that she had indeed provided adequate reasons for seeking those documents. It is also clear, from the Wife’s request, how these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, specifically, the issue of whether matrimonial assets had been dissipated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It is therefore apparent to me that these documents could have been disclosed earlier. This is especially since the Husband did not object to their production on the basis that he did not have the documents sought.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Costs of SUM 1739 are therefore fixed at fixed at $900 (all in), to be paid by the Husband, to the Wife, by 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As for SUM 1684 which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, given that Wife was only successful in respect of Item 4(a), it cannot be said that she was the successful party in respect of SUM 1684. The Husband is thus entitled to costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     There was, in my judgment, no reason to depart from the general principle that costs should follow the event. I do not find that the Husband had acted unreasonably in resisting the request. As I had found, in my substantive decision in respect of SUM 1684, the Wife’s quarrel with his answers went to the truth of those answers rather than their sufficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As to the quantum of costs, I considered that SUM 1684 involved four items, and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact. I also considered the conduct of parties. It was clear to me, from reading the Husband’s answers to the interrogatories posed, that he had provided sufficient answers. As I have mentioned above, the Wife’s basis for taking out SUM 1684 was that she disputed the truth of the Husband’s answers. But that is not the purpose of the interrogatory process (see <em>eg</em>; Rule 70 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Costs of SUM 1684 are therefore fixed at $975 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife, to the Husband, by 30 August 2024.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 1739 at p 34 and 145.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Leave to file further affidavits"],"date":"2024-07-22","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)","title":"XAD v XAE","citation":"[2024] SGFC 54","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31851-SSP.xml","counsel":["Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XAD v XAE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAD <em>v</em> XAE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31851-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 54</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">22 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XAD — XAE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Leave to file further affidavits</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">22 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Husband is a Thai national, and the Wife, a Singaporean. They were married on 2 November 2015 in Thailand. They welcomed two daughters, [A] and [B], into their family. Relations between Husband and Wife were strained and bitter. That was evident to me from the matters narrated in the respective affidavits filed by each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The present dispute stems from the Husband’s claim that the Wife had wrongfully removed the younger daughter, [A], from her place of habitual residence in Thailand in May 2023. In response, the Husband took out an application in FC/OSG 163/2023 (“OSG 163”) on 15 November 2023, seeking custody, care and control of [A], and an order that she be returned to Thailand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As with all originating summons that are filed, the Husband filed his affidavit in support of OSG 163. The Wife filed a reply affidavit. The Husband has now taken out an application in SUM 1664/2024 (“SUM 1664”) seeking leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 12 July 2024. This is my decision in respect of SUM 1664.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable legal principles governing when leave would be granted to file a further affidavit</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties disputed the applicable legal principles which governed the granting of leave to file a further affidavit. At the hearing before me, and in their written submissions, parties strenuously argued that a different legal test should apply. I have summarised the essence of their respective arguments below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Daniel Loh (“Mr Loh”) argued that the starting point was that a litigant should be allowed to put all relevant evidence before the court. The court should err on the side of caution in assessing the relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced by way of a further affidavit – if there was any doubt as to the relevancy of the evidence, it would be best to simply allow the evidence to be adduced. After all, the main concern at the interlocutory stage was to ensure that all the relevant evidence was placed before the judge hearing the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Ryan Yu (“Mr Yu”), disagreed with the applicable legal principles as had been framed by Mr Loh. He argued that there were three cumulative requirements which had to be fulfilled before leave to file a further affidavit would be granted. First, the party seeking leave to file a further affidavit had to show that there were new matters that they wished to respond to. Second, if there were such new matters, one must consider whether the party seeking leave could have responded to those matters at the time which they filed their first affidavit. Third, one must also consider whether the matters which were now being raised were relevant to the disposition of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In determining whether leave should be granted to a party to file a further affidavit, Rule 508 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 is relevant. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Supporting affidavits</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>508.—(1</b>)     <b>Unless otherwise provided in any written law, a plaintiff who intends to adduce evidence in support of an originating summons must do so by affidavit.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The plaintiff must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on every defendant not later than 7 days after the service of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Unless otherwise provided in any written law, in the case of an <em>ex parte</em> originating summons, the applicant must file a supporting affidavit or affidavits at the time of filing of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The defendant who intends to adduce evidence with reference to the originating summons served on him must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The defendant must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on the plaintiff not later than 21 days after being served with a copy of the plaintiff’s affidavit or affidavits under paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<b>6</b>)     <b>No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 508 is identical to Order 28 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2014. It provides the manner in which evidence is to be adduced where an originating summons is taken out. The rules clearly provide that the applicant must file an affidavit in support of their application, and that the respondent, if they intend to adduce evidence in response, must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is therefore clear to me that the rules contemplate that both the applicant, as well as the respondent, are only entitled to file a single affidavit each – unless, of course, the court grants them leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There are good reasons for this. The absence of a hard limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed could well encourage parties to keep exchanging salvoes via affidavit thereby preventing the matter from proceeding to a hearing: see <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> at [69].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There are, of course, cases where affidavit evidence may simply be insufficient to deal with the matter. In such cases, the court has the power to order that the matter continue as though it had been begun by way of writ, and that pleadings be filed, or that any affidavits which had been filed to stand as pleadings: Rule 512 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     While there is a limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed in the context of an originating summons, this is not cast in stone. The reason for this lies in the general right of a litigant to bring all available evidence before the court. As was noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0110.xml')\">[2010] 3 SLR 110</a> (“<em>Basil Anthony</em>”), which had been cited by Mr Loh in his written submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The right of a litigant to bring relevant evidence before the court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24    At this juncture, we would emphasise that every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence relevant to his or her case to the attention of the court. <b>This general right is so fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in support of it; in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive decision or rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial approach to fact-finding.</b> The importance of the right is reflected in the fact that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to compel, on the pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to give relevant evidence, to come forward and give it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25     <b>The general right is, of course, subject to specific limits.</b> For present purposes, the following limits are germane. A litigant only has the right to adduce relevant evidence, as defined by the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and other applicable rules; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be considered by the court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as practicable, take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose is to ensure the fair, economical, swift and orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or collateral motives in an abusive or oppressive manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26    In striking the proper balance between the general right and the specific limits, a trial judge must not only be guided by the applicable rules and decisions, but must look beyond the mechanical application of these rules and decisions, and carefully assess the interests at stake in every case to ensure that a fair outcome is reached through the application of fair processes. It should always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow from the wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful, we are of the view that it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion. With specific regard to the calling of witnesses, we would reiterate what was said in <em>Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0427.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 427</a> (at [17]), where this court allowed an appeal to introduce eleven new witnesses of fact after the summons for directions stage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules and the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary to establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to be adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before the court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If, however, it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is unnecessary, irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control and is in a position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the witness and/or by an order as to costs. It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the court is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by a strict adherence to the rules of civil procedure. [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>Basil Anthony</em>, the appellant had taken issue with the trial judge’s decision to set aside his subpoenas to witnesses which he had intended to call. On appeal, the CA ordered a retrial on the basis that the appellant should have been allowed to subpoena those witnesses as they were in a position to give evidence on the key events on which the outcome of the case turned: <em>Basil Anthony</em> at [50] – [57]. It was in that context that the CA had made those observations on a litigant’s right to bring all evidence before the court, subject, of course, to any limits imposed by law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This general rule, that a litigant is entitled to put all relevant evidence before the court is equally applicable in the context of an originating summons. The Rules do allow a litigant to file a further affidavit, on the condition that leave of court is obtained: Rule 508(6) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The decision as to whether leave should be granted is a matter of discretion. In deciding whether leave should be granted, one factor which the court will consider is whether the further evidence sought to be adduced is relevant to the disposal of the matter. In other words, the evidence canvassed in the further affidavit must have some discernible nexus to the issues in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Naturally, in assessing the relevance of the further evidence sought to be adduced, one must also consider the issues in dispute. OSG 163 was an application taken out under s 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934. In that vein, s 3 of the GIA provides that the welfare of the infant is to be the paramount consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In assessing what is in the infant’s welfare, the court will consider factors such as the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, the child’s relationship with each parent and the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents: <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22083-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 49</a> at [51] – [52]; <em>VGK v VGL and VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24205-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 25</a> at [38] – [39]. In doing so, close attention must be paid to all the facts and circumstances of the case: see <em>e.g. AWN v AWO and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0228.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 228</a> at [4]; <em>UMF v UMG and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22974-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 640</a> at [39] – [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given the fact-sensitive nature of this exercise, I agree with Mr Loh’s point that at the interlocutory stage, one should take a broad view as to the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced. I would emphasise, however, that parties should still carefully consider the evidence that they are seeking to adduce – they must ask themselves whether such evidence is <em>necessary</em> to the disposal of the matter. That the court takes a broad view as to the relevance of the evidence is not a free pass for parties to file voluminous affidavits containing evidence that is not necessary to the disposal of the case. In such a situation, adverse costs orders may be made on the basis that that party has taken an unreasonable stance in the proceedings, and that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [9] citing <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In summary, these are the principles which I apply to determine whether leave should be granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit in OSG 163. For clarity, these principles which I have articulated should not be construed as bright-line rules.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, where originating applications are concerned, evidence is adduced by way of affidavit, and both the applicant as well as the respondent, are entitled by the Rules under the FJR, to file one affidavit each. That said, litigants have a <em>general</em> right to bring all available evidence before the court – and so, the court can, as provided for by Rule 508(6), grant a party leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As to whether leave should be granted, the court will consider the relevance of the evidence in the further affidavit. In the context of child guardianship applications, given the fact-sensitive exercise of determining what is in the infant’s welfare, the court would take a broad view in assessing the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties must bear in mind whether the evidence is indeed necessary to the disposal of the case, and any unreasonable conduct such as the filing of voluminous affidavits may well be dealt with by way of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband should be granted leave to file a further affidavit </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband exhibited a draft of the further affidavit which he sought leave to file. It contained three distinct parts. The first part (paragraphs 7 – 78) dealt with the following events which took place after OSG 163 had been filed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Divorce proceedings in Thailand dealing with the custody of the children. During the hearing, Mr Loh informed me that these divorce proceedings had recently concluded, after the Husband had sought leave to file a further affidavit in SUM 1664. There was therefore nothing in the draft affidavit disclosing the conclusion of those divorce proceedings, nor was there any evidence exhibited as to any orders made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Attempts by parties to settle OSG 163 amicably. The Husband sets out the chronology of negotiations with the Wife by which they attempted to settle matters. According to the Husband, the Wife had initially agreed to return [A] to him. However, after some four months of toing and froing, the Husband realised that the Wife was dragging her feet over the matter in a bid to delay the hearing of OSG 163 and to further alienate [A] from him, as well as her sister, [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 January 2024, the Wife withdrew her application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Husband. That the Wife withdrew the application, according to the Husband, demonstrates that her allegations that he had committed family violence was without merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Refusal to renew the elder daughter’s ([B]’s) passport. The Husband had instructed his lawyers to send a letter to the Wife’s lawyers. That letter claimed that the Wife had unreasonably failed to cooperate regarding the renewal of the eldest daughter’s passport. This meant that [B] was unable to travel during the Songkram festival (Thailand’s New Year public holiday).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The “Roblox incident”. The Husband explained that he would play games on Roblox with both his daughters. He explained this made them feel as though they were a family. On the morning of 8 April 2024, out of the blue, he received a phone call from [A] who told him, whilst sobbing between words, that she did not want to go back to Thailand. The Husband later discovered that this phone call had been recorded. He believes that the Wife had orchestrated the entire episode. Later that very day, at noon, the Husband logged back onto Roblox only to discover that he had been deleted as a friend on [A]’s friend list, and was blocked from adding [A] back as a friend. Apart from this incident on the 8<sup>th</sup> of April 2024, the Husband also details other incidents that took place over the Roblox application which, according to him, demonstrate that the Wife has been attempting to alienate [A]from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The second part of the Husband’s draft affidavit (at paragraphs 79 – 109) sets out his replies to the fresh allegations of fact which the Wife had raised in her reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The third part of the draft affidavit (at paragraphs 111 to 124) sets out the Husband’s reply to paragraphs 86 – 133 of the Wife’s reply affidavit. Mr Loh points out that these paragraphs in the Wife’s reply affidavit are not in response to anything which the Husband had said in his supporting affidavit for OSG 163. In any event, as Mr Loh explains, these paragraphs of the Wife’s reply affidavit set out fresh allegations which the Husband has not had the opportunity to respond to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As to the events set out in the first part of the Husband’s draft affidavit, there can, in my judgment, be no quarrel that they are relevant to OSG 163. The events which had been set out (above at [21]) paint a fuller picture of the family dynamics, as well as the relationship between the child and the parents, and whether there could possibly be any safety concerns on the part of [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for the second and third parts of the draft affidavits, I am also satisfied that the matters disclosed therein are also relevant to the disposal of OSG 163. In particular, the matters disclosed by the Husband in the draft affidavit are relevant to determining whether there has indeed been parental alienation as well as what would be in [A]’s best interests (<em>ie</em>, whether she should be educated in Singapore or Thailand) – these are issues which have a direct bearing on the determination of OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Leave is therefore granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit. As a final point, I add that I have taken a liberal approach to assessing the relevancy of the evidence raised, especially considering that the nature of the assessment undertaken by the judge hearing OSG 163 is necessarily a fact-sensitive one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In addition to granting the Husband leave to file the further affidavit, I also order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The further affidavit should also state whether the divorce proceedings in Thailand had been concluded and what orders had been made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s further affidavit is to be filed and served no later than the 29<sup>th</sup> of July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The costs of SUM 1664 shall be reserved to the judge hearing OSG 163. I do so because while I have taken the view that the matters raised in the further affidavit are relevant to the issues in OSG 163, I make no finding or comment as to whether they are necessary to the disposition of the case. The necessity of the evidence sought to be adduced in the further affidavit could, as I have explained above (at [19]), have a bearing on costs. That is, in my judgment, a matter best assessed by the judge hearing the substantive application. In that vein, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Loh and Mr Yu for their able assistance and their well-written submissions.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s draft affidavit at paras 52 – 54.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary matters – Division of matrimonial assets"],"date":"2024-07-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce 113 of 2022","title":"WZV v WZW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 52","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31843-SSP.xml","counsel":["Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife","Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband."],"timestamp":"2024-08-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Darryl Soh","html":"<root><head><title>WZV v WZW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZV <em>v</em> WZW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31843-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 52</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce 113 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Darryl Soh </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife; Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZV — WZW </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Darryl Soh:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). By consent, the Parties agreed for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of the marriage, with supervised access to the Husband. The Parties could not however agree on the financial and children’s custody orders. In respect of the division of matrimonial assets, the Parties disagreed on the satisfaction of the Wife’s personal liabilities from the pool of matrimonial assets and the indirect contributions ratio to be ascribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 17 April 2024, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children, for the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total monthly children’s maintenance of $890.00. The Husband was dissatisfied with the orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets and filed a Notice of Appeal on 24 April 2024. In these grounds, I explain my decision on the division of matrimonial assets in greater detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties are in their 40s and they were married in 2004 after they first met as colleagues. The Husband is presently employed in the security industry and the Wife is in an administrative role. After they were married, they temporarily resided in the home of the Husband’s parents. The Parties subsequently purchased their matrimonial home (“Matrimonial Home”) a year later and they moved into it together with the Husband’s family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Parties are blessed with two children, both of whom are in or around their teenage years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Difficulties in the marriage arose sometime a year after their marriage and the Parties had numerous disputes that led to heated quarrels. Years later from February 2017, the Parties ceased living together as husband and wife. They however continued to reside in the Matrimonial Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 10 January 2022 on the basis that the Husband behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. The Husband subsequently filed his Defence and Counterclaim on 4 February 2022. The Parties subsequently came to an agreement and the divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis on the fact that the Parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ. The marriage was dissolved, and Interim Judgment was granted on 6 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues in Dispute and Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Parties filed the following affidavits in respect of the ancillary reliefs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 6 June 2023 (“WAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 June 2023 (“HAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 22 September 2023 (“H2AM”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 25 September 2023 (“W2AM”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The hearing of the ancillary reliefs took place over three days, on 22 January 2022, 9 January 2024, and 17 April 2024. In respect of the children’s care orders, I recorded the Parties’ consent for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of marriage, with supervised access to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children. In respect of the financial orders, I ordered the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, no spousal maintenance for the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total of $890.00 monthly for the two children’s maintenance. To achieve a division as close to the said ratio of 63.82:36.18, I made the following consequential distribution orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    The [Matrimonial Home] … shall be sold on the open market within 9 months of the Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows: -.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    To make full payment of the outstanding housing loan to the bank (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    To pay the HDB resale levy (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">d.    The balance net sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 78% to the [Wife] and 22% to the [Husband];</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">e.    Each party shall pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to party's respective CPF accounts from the party's proportion of the balance sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">i.    In the event the [Husband] is unable to pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to his CPF accounts from his proportion of the balance sale proceeds, the [Wife] shall transfer from her CPF account to top-up the said shortfall CPF monies into the [Husband’s] CPF account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">ii.    After the completion of sale of the matrimonial flat, the [Husband] shall transfer back the said shortfall CPF monies from his CPF account to the [Wife’s] CPF account</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">f.    The [Wife] shall have sole conduct of the sale of the [Matrimonial Home].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband was dissatisfied and appealed against the orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets on 24 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Pool of Matrimonial Assets Not Disputed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Parties did not dispute the pool of matrimonial assets.

mortgage on the Matrimonial Home ($144,245.72) was to be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife also did not object to the Husband’s personal liabilities ($33,109.58) being satisfied from the same. The Parties however could not agree whether the same treatment was to be extended to the Wife’s substantial liabilities in her name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s Personal Liabilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     According to the Wife, she owed a total of $425,320.94 to creditor financial institutions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Wife explained that the Husband suffered a slipped disc in 2007 after carrying a heavy load during his then employment in logistics.

liabilities, the Husband did not accept the quantum stated. I found this to be a somewhat curious position to take because of the clear documentary evidence in support.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband bore the consequent evidential burden to rebut the evidence put forward by the Wife, but the Husband had no evidence to the contrary. In light of this absence, I accepted the Wife’s case that she had personal liabilities of $375,012.17 as at the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For completeness, I refer to the Husband’s specific line of defence that his medical treatment was covered by insurance. This defence was used to address whether liabilities were in fact incurred by the Wife. I found that this line of defence did not assist the Husband in light of the clear document evidence tendered in the Wife’s supplementary affidavit of 21 February 2024 confirming the extent of her liabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Whether the Wife’s Personal Liabilities are to be Deducted from the Pool of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband took the position that the Wife’s personal liabilities should not be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets. No reasons or submissions were advanced in support of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As articulated by Choo Han Teck J in <em>WNR v WNQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30472-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 43</a> (“<em>WNR v WNQ</em>”), affirming the observations in <em>WAS v WAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27228-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 7</a>, the key issue is whether the spouse’s debts are proven to have existed as at the Interim Judgment date. If so, the spouse’s liabilities should rightly be accounted for when calculating the net matrimonial assets available for division. Further, there was no allegation whatsoever that the liabilities were incurred inappropriately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was therefore unsustainable in light of the observations in <em>WNR v WNQ</em>.

relative to the opposing party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be 60:40 in his favour. The Husband broadly relied on the following in support: (a) various indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister, (b) the Husband’s monthly contributions towards the family’s household expenses (<em>i.e. $</em>50.00 for household items and $1,300.00 towards the then family vehicle), (c) <em>ad hoc</em> past payments he made towards the family (<em>i.e.</em> purchase of an air conditioner and a laptop), and (d) various acts he had done in the past (<em>i.e.</em> ferrying the children to engagements and medical appointments).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be either 70:30 or 80:20 in her favour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Wife argued that she was the primary caregiver of the children and that the Husband was an absent father as he was totally involved in his drinking. The Wife additionally argued that she was the sole provider for the family and the household expenses were borne by her. To this end, she had to deplete her savings to ease the family expenses and took loans to pay for the Husband’s medical expenses following his injury. The Wife also alleged that the Husband was financially irresponsible and engaged in a cavalier attitude where he spent much time drinking outside with his friends after work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I adopted a broad-brush approach as articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>USB v USA</em> at [43] – [46] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions. Having considered the evidence and submissions in this case, I set the indirect contributions ratio as 60:40 in favour of the Wife given her relatively higher indirect financial and non-financial contributions. There were four material points that I considered when arriving at this finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     First, I gave no credit to the Husband for the various alleged indirect financial and non-financial contributions by the Husband’s family. Assuming that these contributions did in fact occur, the Husband failed to show that these contributions were the result or product of his own personal efforts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I did not take into account the Wife’s personal liabilities that will be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, towards her indirect contributions. To do so would be double counting her efforts. If it had not been deducted, I would have agreed with the high indirect contributions ratio that she submitted in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Third, I accepted the Wife’s case that she was the primary caregiver and I accept that she provided for a substantial portion of the family expenses following the Husband’s injury. Based on the Husband’s own evidence, he was generally unemployed between 2009 and 2012, with intermittent employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The overall relatively lower levels of the Husband’s CPF accounts were also consistent with the Wife earning a significantly higher relative income between the Parties over the years. Additionally, and ironically, the Husband’s own submissions on indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister disclosed the lack of such contributions emanating from his own personal efforts. Similarly, the Husband’s submissions on his personal contributions, if assumed to be accurate, also revealed his relative lack of involvement and efforts. When considered holistically, the Husband submissions validated the Wife’s arguments that she should be credited with a higher ratio of indirect contributions <em>between the Parties</em>. For completeness and to avoid doubt, I did not accept that the Wife’s submissions that she was the <em>sole</em> provider for the family as I accepted that the Husband provided <em>some</em> contributions such as the purchase and maintenance of the then family vehicle and made some minor contributions towards the family expenses over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, I rejected the Husband’s case that his insurance payouts would have covered all related contingencies and expenses arising from his injury. He provided no evidence whatsoever and he bore the burden of proof. Be that as it may, it could not be disputed that the Wife was in debt and the Husband was unemployed for a material period. This resulted in him minimally contributing towards the family’s finances, and the Wife having to make up for the lack of family income. Further, there was no evidence whatsoever that the loans that the Wife took was inappropriately incurred. When the facts and circumstances were considered as a whole and on a balance of probabilities, I accepted that the loans taken and serviced by the Wife prior to Interim Judgment were for the family expenses, which included the Husband’s medical treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     When the above-mentioned circumstances were considered, I was of the view that an indirect contributions ratio leaning in favour of the Wife amounting to 60:40 was merited. It could not however amount to the high ratio submitted by the Wife because a significant amount of her personal liabilities would be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, and it would not also reflect the various indirect contributions made by the Husband over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Concluding the issue of indirect contributions, I wish to observe that taking the Husband’s case as its highest, I found his submissions on indirect contributions to be unreasonable and without basis. The points made in support showed no objectivity as to why they would merit a ratio that is relatively higher in his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Step 3 – Overall Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The average ratio of direct and indirect contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets was consequently <b>63.82:36.18</b> in the Wife’s favour. Both Parties did not seek for further adjustments to be made. As such the average ratio was taken to be the final division ratio.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Distribution of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In order to achieve as close to the division ratio of <b>63.82:36.18</b> in the Wife’s favour, I ordered the distribution of the pool of matrimonial assets in the manner set out at [8] above.
