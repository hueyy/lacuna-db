She did so by way of these proceedings, which she commenced in July 2023. Four months later, in October 2023, she sold $300,000 of securities that she owned and transferred $120,000 of the proceeds to her two adult children. She contended that she was unemployed, had to provide for the two adult children, and depended on the financial support of the husband. I declined to grant this application, and the wife has filed an appeal against this decision. I now provide my reasons for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The court in an application for such wife maintenance considers, at the outset, whether the husband had “neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her” (see s 69(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). If so, the court will assess the quantum of maintenance to be paid based on all the circumstances of the case, including the factors enumerated in s 69(4) of the Charter. Further, an application for wife maintenance that is pursued when divorce proceedings between the spouses are ongoing is an order for “interim” maintenance. The focus of such interim maintenance is the “immediate needs and necessities” of the wife. This is because the complete financial resources of the parties would not have been “fully fleshed out or substantiated until all preparations and filings for the ancillary matters have been completed”. Hence, the interim maintenance operates as “tide-over” sums that are temporary in nature and conservative in quantum (see <em>TEQ v TER</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17973-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 119</a> at [20]; see also <em>ARL v ARN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0142.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 142</a> at [32]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Before me, the wife claimed monthly expenses of $5,040.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This sum included generous estimates for food and groceries (which totalled $2,200); apparel and grooming (which totalled $450); travel and entertainment (which totalled $1,270); and an allowance for her parents at $400. The receipts that the wife exhibited in support of these claims revealed a lifestyle of dining at restaurants to the tune of $100–$200 each week and an affinity for tableware that cost up to $552 for set of a food tray and teacups. By the admission of the wife, these expenses were “extravagant for someone in [her] position”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Equally, too, this extravagance sat uneasily with the “tide-over” nature of interim maintenance that was sought in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife contended that she had to support her two adult children, who were pursuing university education in Singapore. But she did not provide any estimate for or breakdown of the amount to which she had to support them. Nor did she dispute that the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. There was little objective evidence that the reasonable expenses of either child exceeded this sum. This left little need for the wife to expend her financial resources on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Still, the wife had, after commencing these proceedings for interim maintenance, transferred $120,000 of her moneys to the two children. Even if she had done so in a bid to support the two children, there was no evidence that the reasonable expenses of the children consumed all or even most of the $120,000. This was especially when the husband had been maintaining each child in the monthly sum of $800. With that $120,000, the wife could have supported herself for 200 months based on the monthly maintenance of $600 that she sought in these proceedings. Given the willingness of the wife to give such a large sum to the children when she had little need to do so and when the children had not made any demand for such a sum, it was difficult to see how the wife needed any interim maintenance to tide her through the resolution of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Although the wife was unemployed at the time of these proceedings, she was not without financial resources. By her own estimate, she owned up to $500,000 of securities at least up until October 2023, which was four months after she commenced her claim for interim maintenance. Hence, at least as of the time when these proceedings were commenced, the wife had ample financial resources with which she could have supported herself. On this basis alone, there was no justification to order the husband to provide interim maintenance for the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Even if the wife had sold $300,000 of her securities in October 2023, she continued to own a substantial quantum of securities. Although she had transferred $120,000 of the proceeds from that sale to the children, she would have retained $180,000 of those proceeds. The wife claimed that she had used this balance sum to repay debts but offered scant evidence for or details on those debts. It was thus unclear that the wife lacked the financial resources to maintain herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Ultimately, the touchstone for an assessment of maintenance is that of reasonableness. This inquiry transcended consideration of the parties’ expenses, financial resources, and conduct. On the facts, the wife could reasonably maintain herself with her own financial resources. Further, it was hardly reasonable for her to disenfranchise herself of $120,000, or 200 months of interim maintenance, after commencing these proceedings and when she had no necessity for doing so. It was thus unjustified to have the husband maintain her further.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>WAEIC at pp 11–12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>1NE at p 34.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-08-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)","title":"XCL v XCM","citation":"[2024] SGFC 75","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32108-SSP.xml","counsel":["VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-09-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCL v XCM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCL <em>v</em> XCM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32108-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 75</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1418 of 2011 (Summons No 2193 and 2194 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> VM Vidthiya (Victory Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XCL — XCM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Divorce proceedings had concluded in 2011. The court had recorded a consent order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Clause 2 of that order provided that the Husband was to pay maintenance of $300 per month for each of the two children. The Wife has now applied <em>vide</em> SUM 1987/2024 (“SUM 1987”) to vary clause 2. To that end, she took out an application for discovery in SUM 2194/2024 (“SUM 2194”) and interrogatories in SUM 2193/2024 (“SUM 2193”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard SUM 2194 and SUM 2193 on 12 August and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that the provisions which govern the Wife’s application for variation of the consent order recorded are found in Part X of the Women’s Charter 1961 (<em>see Nalini d/o Ramachandran v Saseedaran Nair s/o Krishnan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0098.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 98</a> at [14]), the applicable rules that apply to discovery and interrogatories are found in Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. As is stated in Rule 63(2):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Rules 63 to 77 apply to all matters involving ancillary or financial relief, as the case may be, in any proceedings commenced by writ or originating summons under Part X of the Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The purpose of discovery and interrogatories is to ensure that the judge hearing the matter has all the available evidence needed to dispose of the case. In that vein, one must consider the relevance and necessity of the discovery and interrogatories sought, bearing in mind the issues that are likely to arise at the hearing of the substantive matter. Here, it appears from an affidavit which the Wife had filed,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that the main issue in her application for variation is whether there has been a material change in circumstances (see <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19435-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 196</a> at [11] – [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is with this in mind that I now turn to consider the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2194 – Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Item 1 was a request for the breakdown of the Husband’s monthly expenses with an amount for each item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This was, strictly speaking, not a request for the Husband to produce documents. It should have been framed as an interrogatory as opposed to being a request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Leaving this aside, the Wife’s request is indeed relevant to determining whether a variation of the maintenance order is warranted. A breakdown of the Husband’s expenses will go towards showing whether there has been indeed a material change in circumstances that warrant such a variation. I will therefore order that the Husband provide a breakdown of his monthly expenses and provide the relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I turn next to Items 2 and 3 which related to the Husband’s income. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 2: IRAS Notice of Assessment for the past 3 years;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3: Pay slips for the past 6 months</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I accept that these documents are relevant and necessary for the variation proceedings. They would cast light on whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances, such as whether the Husband had experienced a drastic increase in his income, that warranted a variation to the original maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 2 and 3 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I shall next deal with Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 together. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had debts (Item 4);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Court documents related to the Debt Repayment Scheme (Item 5);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Documents from the bank to prove allegedly incurred debts of $13,327.76 (Item 8);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with [J], [SC] Pte Ltd, [A] Pte Limited, [RC] Pte Ltd (Item 9);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the debts allegedly incurred with M1, Singtel and Starhub (Item 10);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $21,056.67 under “Hire Purchase” (Item 11);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Documentary evidence to substantiate the alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave (Item 12).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the request in respect of Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. They would allow the Wife to assess whether the Husband indeed had such debts, and in that vein, consider whether may still be worthwhile pursuing her application for a variation of a maintenance order. Should the application proceed to hearing, these documents were certainly relevant and necessary to allowing the judge hearing the matter to determine the true state of the Husband’s financial affairs, and whether there had indeed been a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In this vein, I will also allow the Wife’s request in Item 6 where she sought copies of the Husband’s bank statements for the past 3 months. These statements were, in my judgment, relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Husband’s financial circumstances and thus had a direct bearing on the Wife’s application for an upwards variation in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request in Item 7, which was for documentary evidence to prove that the Husband had been paying his mother a monthly sum as an allowance. The reason for this request was that the Husband had listed his mother as a dependent in the Consultation Form of [D]. Whether the Husband is indeed supporting his mother financially is relevant for the purposes of the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. It would give the court a fuller picture of the Husband’s financial obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s request in Item 7 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 2193 – Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     These were the interrogatories as framed by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    State the reasons for incurring $13,327.76 as debts with the various banks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State the reason for engaging the services of 3 telco companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Explain why you had incurred an alleged debt of $7000 under Medisave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $7000 from the “Government”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $320 from [X] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.    Explain with documentary evidence the alleged debt of $1800 from [Y] Pte Ltd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The common thread binding these interrogatories is that the Wife wants the Husband to explain the reason for incurring these debts. During the hearing, counsel for the Wife had explained that the Wife wanted to know why the Husband had these debts because she did not want a situation where the Husband incurs debts and shirks his responsibility to provide for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I disallow the Wife’s application for interrogatories. These interrogatories were not, in my judgment, relevant to the Wife’s application to vary the maintenance order. The Husband’s reasons for incurring the debt were hardly relevant to the issue of whether there had been a material change in circumstances which warranted the upwards variation in the maintenance order that the Wife sought. What was relevant was the extent of the Husband’s financial liabilities, and to that end, I have allowed the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 2194.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum up, the Wife’s applications in SUM 2194 for discovery is allowed in its entirety. Her application in SUM 2193 for interrogatories is dismissed. The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by 16 September.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Costs submissions for SUM 2194 and 2193 are to be filed, by way of letter, limited to a maximum of 3 pages each. This is to be done no later than 2 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the application for a variation of the maintenance order.

At the material time, the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter was 7 years old (D.O.B: xx April 2014) while the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter was 3 years old (D.O.B.: xx March 2018).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The terms of this agreement were recorded by way of a consent order (“<b>2021 Order</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In January 2024 (i.e., 2½ years later), the Plaintiff applied to vary the 2021 Order in relation to the Defendant’s maintenance of, and access to, their daughters (“<b>Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Following mediation in March 2024, the parties reached a compromise on some of the Plaintiff’s requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       At the hearing before me, the Plaintiff’s requests on the following were to be determined:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Defendant’s monthly maintenance of each daughter <em>be increased</em> from $500 to $2,500 (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> Request</b>”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Defendant is to <em>additionally</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)       Provide $800 annually for each daughter’s “school opening expenses, uniforms and schoolbooks” from 1 December 2024 (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Request</b>”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bear an equal share of the daughters’ “General Practitioner, emergency medical/hospitalisation and dental expenses” that are not covered by existing insurance policies (“<b>3<sup>rd</sup> Request</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff’s grounds for the above requests are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the living and educational expenses of her growing daughters had increased since the 2021 Order was made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, it was highlighted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter had been referred to the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”) for counselling for having suicidal tendencies.

However, the Plaintiff had been told that fees at about $150 to $250 will be imposed from 1 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Defendant was able to provide more maintenance as he had been doing “very well”. The Plaintiff came to this view because his income was more than $10,000 monthly, excluding commissions and bonuses. Further, after the divorce, the Defendant was able to purchase a condominium (which she believed to be valued minimally at $1.26m) and a “<em>new</em> Mercedes Benz” (which she believed to be valued minimally at $332,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant objected to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Requests.

The Defendant wanted the 3<sup>rd</sup> Request to be phrased such that each party would be required to act expeditiously to make the relevant claims.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> During oral submissions, the Defendant also wanted to make clear that there should be no double claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">That Paragraph 3.1 of the Order of Court dated 30 September 2021 shall be varied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.1.1  Commencing from 1 January 2024 and thereafter on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of each month, the maintenance which the Defendant shall pay for [the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter] shall increase from S$500.00 per month to $900.00 per month.

In determining whether an application to increase child maintenance is reasonable, it would be appropriate to consider, among others, the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there has been a significant and unexpected increase in the child’s expenses: see e.g., <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<b><em>BZD</em></b>”) at [14]; <em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a> (“<b><em>TOC</em></b>”) at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the proposed increase in maintenance is fair given the parents’ current income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the paying parent can afford to pay the proposed increase in maintenance given his/her level of expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Having set out the applicable principles, I will now apply them to the present case. Given that the Plaintiff had sought to vary the maintenance amount, she bore the burden proving that the requirements in s 73 are met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">No significant increase in the daughters’ expenses since 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ current monthly expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To start, I note that the Plaintiff had sought a staggering five-time increase in the daughters’ maintenance – from <em>$12,000</em> annually<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> to <em>$60,800</em> annually.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><em>Instinctively</em>, such a scale of increase – within a short span of three years from the time of the 2021 Order – appears to be unreasonable. This is especially so given the absence of life-altering events (e.g., the development of a medical condition) during this period of the daughters’ lives. On scrutinising the Plaintiff’s list of the daughters’ expenses, I found several of them to be <em>in fact</em> excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, an appropriate quantification of the daughters’ current expenses is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Daughter (10 years old) – $1,497 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter (6 years old) – $1,029 monthly</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>For details of the above quantification, see <b><u>Annex 1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex 2</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughters’ monthly expenses in 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The next step is to consider whether there had been a significant increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order. To do this, it is necessary to determine what such expenses were in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On this, the parties held the following divergent positions:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"42.4515096980604%\"><col width=\"29.8340331933613%\"><col width=\"27.7144571085783%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Monthly expenses in 2021</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1<sup>st</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(7 years old)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(3 years old)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Plaintiff’s case</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,950</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$865</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Defendant’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,697</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,577</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At this juncture, I digress to observe that based on the Defendant’s own case above, maintenance at $500 monthly for each daughter is <em>clearly</em> inadequate given their expenses in 2021. This amount is significantly less than 55.2% which the Defendant claimed should be his share of contribution to his daughters’ maintenance at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I did not find the divergence between the parties’ positions ($1,950 vs $1,697) to be significant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses in 2021, I preferred the Defendant’s position. I noted that the amount of $1,577 is <em>closer</em> (than $865) to the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s monthly expenses. This can explain why the parties had agreed in 2021 that the Defendant was to provide the <em>same</em> amount of monthly maintenance (i.e., $500) for each of their daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Finding</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given the above, I make the following finding:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,497) are lower than those in 2021. This is so based on both the Plaintiff’s case ($1,950) and Defendant’s case ($1,697).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the 2<sup>nd</sup> Daughter, her current monthly expenses ($1,029) are also lower than those in 2021 (using the Defendant’s figure of $1,577).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to vary the maintenance amount <em>upwards</em> on the ground that there has been an increase in the daughters’ monthly expenses since the 2021 Order was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance amount is unreasonable given the parties’ current income levels </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I now turn to the issue of whether the maintenance amount is reasonable given the parties’ current income levels. The parties accepted that their share of contribution to their daughters’ maintenance should be in line with their current relative income levels.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s current monthly income</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Accordingly, I first determined what the Defendant’s current monthly income was. On this, I noted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant’s pay package consisted of (i) fixed monthly salaries as well as (ii) payments under the employee referral scheme and bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Between December 2023 to May 2024, the Defendant’s nett average salary was about $10,000 monthly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In February 2024, he received $125,602 in cash bonuses (“<b>Bonus</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Based on the Defendant’s IRAS Notice of Assessment 2021 to 2023, there is no evidence that such bonuses had been issued in these years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Before proceeding further, I wish to address a point raised by the Defendant. He submitted that the Bonus should be disregarded in assessing his income as these were variable and non-guaranteed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I disagree. The Bonus is clearly part of the Defendant’s income and is indicative of his earning capacity: <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [43]. Courts have typically considered a party’s bonuses when making and varying maintenance orders: see e.g., <em>Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0785.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 785</a> at [98]; <em>BZD</em> at [12]. The Charter does not ring-fence a party’s bonuses from being subject to enforcement of maintenance orders: see e.g., s 80 (definitions of “earnings” and “maintenance order”), s 81 to s 88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The real issue is <em>how</em> the Bonus should affect the calibration of the Defendant’s monthly income given that the bonus is variable and non-guaranteed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Plaintiff had approached this issue by simply adding the Bonus to six months of the Defendant’s most recent monthly income (where data was available) and then divided that figure <em>by six months</em>. I am unable to agree with this approach. It ignores the fact that the Bonus was given for <em>12 months</em> of work done in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In assessing how to fairly factor the Bonus into the Defendant’s monthly income, I am of the view that the following is relevant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Between 2020 to February 2022 (i.e., the two-year period when <em>no</em> bonus was declared), the Defendant was working at <em>Bank A</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     From February 2022, he began working at <em>Bank B</em> (his current employer).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Bonus was declared two years later – in February 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the above, one option is to divide the Bonus over the <em>two-year period</em> that the Defendant was at Bank B. This will ensure that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Bonus is considered in computing the Defendant’s monthly nett income,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Address the Defendant’s concerns that future bonuses are variable and non-guaranteed, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Reflect the reality that he had received the Bonus only after two years of working at Bank B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The above approach is consistent with <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [41] to [43].

This assumes that he will continue to work at Bank B. In this regard, I noted that there was no evidence that he was leaving Bank B or would be retrenched.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     At this point, I digress to note that the Defendant’s current monthly income is <em>higher</em> than in 2021 when the 2021 Order was made. Based on his IRAS Notice of Assessment for 2022 ($109,881), the Defendant’s monthly income then was <b>$9,156.75</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Defendant’s current monthly income of $15,233 is <em>66% higher</em> than in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Defendant’s share of child maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having established that the Defendant’s current monthly income, the next step is to determine what should be his share of child maintenance vis-à-vis the Plaintiff.

To recap, the Defendant’s monthly nett income (inclusive of Bonus) is <b>$15,233</b>. On the other hand, the Plaintiff’s monthly nett income (inclusive of bonuses) from December 2023 to May 2024 is <b>$11,892</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Comparing their nett monthly incomes, the Plaintiff to Defendant nett monthly income ratio should be <b>44</b>:<b>56</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It bears highlighting that the ratio of 44:56 is similar to the parties’ relative monthly income ratio at the time of the 2021 Order.

It is <em>unreasonable</em> to expect the Plaintiff to cover this shortfall – especially when her income is lower than the Defendant’s: s 73 of the Charter. In my view, the shortfall can be addressed by the Defendant paying an additional $400 (rounded up from $348.32) in monthly maintenance for his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Defendant can afford to pay the additional maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The issue now is whether the Defendant could afford to pay this additional maintenance. If the answer is no, then the Plaintiff would have to either (a) come up with the funds to cover the shortfall, or (b) reduce/forgo some of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expense items – e.g., food and groceries, vitamins and supplements for her skin condition, tuition and enrichment classes. The second option will be inconsistent with the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s welfare and interest: s 73.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the Defendant <em>can</em> afford to pay the additional maintenance. According to the Defendant, his current monthly expenses is around $12,747.72 to $13,177.72.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Given that his nett monthly income is $15,233, this means that the Defendant has a <em>monthly surplus of about $2,000</em>. This means that he can afford to pay an additional $400 to maintain his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter and still have savings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     It would be appropriate to order the increase in maintenance to commence from 1 January 2024. This is because many of the documentary evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter’s expenses dated to the start of the year. Furthermore, there had been a serious shortfall since 2021: see [37] and [38] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Assuming that the Defendant had paid the maintenance amount up to the time of the hearing (September), this means that there is a shortfall of $3,600 in maintenance from January to September.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> I decided to give the Defendant until 1 December 2024 to pay the shortfall to the Plaintiff. This four-month grace period should give the Defendant sufficient time to raise these funds. After all, he has a monthly buffer of about $1,600 after paying the additional maintenance. If needed, the Defendant can also cut down on his monthly personal expenses – such as “F&amp;B” ($1,000) and “Networking &amp; Entertainment” ($500). I am confident that the Defendant will not shirk away from his financial responsibility towards his 1<sup>st</sup> Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For the above reasons, I varied the 2021 Order as set out in [9] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Parties are urged to agree on the costs of FC/SUM 85/2024.

Thus, her share of direct financial contributions was 13.2%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I next determined the parties’ ratio of indirect contributions. The Plaintiff became a stay-at-home mother about one year after the marriage. She cared for the children and did the housework, while receiving a sum of $500 from the Defendant monthly. When the children were older, the Defendant wanted the Plaintiff to return to the workforce, which she did in 2011. Notwithstanding that, the Plaintiff continued to do all the housework. The Plaintiff also cared for the Defendant when he was hospitalised.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> As the Plaintiff’s evidence was essentially undisputed, I accepted it. Bearing in mind the Plaintiff’s tremendous indirect contributions as a housewife and even after she started working, I attributed a ratio of 80:20 for indirect contributions in the Plaintiff’s favour.

After deducting the value of the Plaintiff’s assets in her sole name, the balance due to her from the Defendant is $511,080.50. As the Defendant had failed to participate in the proceedings, I took the view that the most effective way to implement the division was for the matrimonial home to be transferred to the Plaintiff, and I so ordered. The value of the matrimonial home is $455,000, which leaves a further balance of $56,080.50 payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, which I also ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not think that this was draconian or unfair to the Defendant. The Defendant has substantial sums in his CPF accounts, which he can use to purchase a property and finance his retirement. He also has substantial investments: see [8] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For completeness, I had doubts on the Plaintiff’s submission that the assets should be divided equally by applying the approach in <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) (which is applicable only to long single-income marriages), given that the Plaintiff worked for a substantial part of the marriage and was earning more than a token sum. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the outcome would not have been significantly different regardless of the approach adopted. It is important to note that the Court in <em>TNL</em> did not <em>mandate</em> equal division in all long single-income marriages; it spoke of a trend where the Courts were <em>inclined towards</em> equal division in such cases. Thus, the High Court in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a> observed at [70]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL v TNK</em> (at [38] to [42]), the courts have been inclined towards equal division in a number of cases involving long Single-Income Marriages. I have observed that in precedents identified by the Court of Appeal in decisions before TNL v TNK (see [42]–[44]) above, the proportion of division in long marriages where there were children tend to be around 35–50%</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The final ratio in this case falls squarely within in this range.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I also observe that because the Defendant did not participate in these proceedings, the Defendant did not file an affidavit of assets and means to disclose all his assets. Thus, there is a possibility that the list of assets above, which was compiled from the documents that the Plaintiff could obtain herself, may not be complete. To be clear, I did <b><u>not</u></b> award an uplift to the Plaintiff’s share on this basis, because I was not addressed on this point, but I mention this to provide further context to show that the division of the known assets is not unfair to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As the Plaintiff will receive a sizeable share of the assets, I declined to order spousal maintenance. The Plaintiff did not appeal against this aspect of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I also ordered costs fixed at $3,000 to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 16 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Written submissions at para 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Affidavit of service filed 12 July 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>AOM at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>AOM at p 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>AOM at p 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>AOM at p 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>AOM at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>AOM at p 21A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>AOM at p 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>AOM at p 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>AOM at p 30.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>AOM at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>AOM at para 18.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure","Family Law – Procedure – Leave to make an interim judgment final"],"date":"2024-08-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1730 of 2022 (Summons No 2463 of 2024)","title":"XCN v XCO","citation":"[2024] SGFC 76","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32087-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff absent and unrepresented","Dharmambal Shanti Jayaram (Dharma Law LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XCN v XCO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCN <em>v</em> XCO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32087-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 76</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

That Rule states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    A spouse may make an application to make final an interim judgment pronounced against him —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    without leave, if no application is made under paragraph (1) within the time specified in paragraph (3)(b); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    with leave, in any other case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on 28 March 2023. The ancillary matters were heard on 19 June 2024 and orders were made on 18 July 2024. The court’s orders in relation to the ancillary matters were extracted on 20 July 2024 <em>vide</em> ORC 3202/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant’s lawyers attempted to make the interim judgment final but were directed to seek the leave of court to do so. This is because the interim judgment had been granted based on the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SUM 2463 came up before me for hearing. At the hearing, I had asked counsel for the Defendant, Ms Dharmambal Jayaram (“Ms Jayaram”) if Rule 96(6) stipulated that the leave of court to make the interim judgment final could only be sought after the time period for doing so as set out in the Rules (see Rule 96(1) and Rule 96(3)) had expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Ms Jayaram argued that this should not be the case. This would allow the Plaintiff to weaponise the rules of procedure by refusing to make the interim judgment final. If the interim judgment was not made final, the Defendant could not move on with her life – she could not remarry, and the money that she was entitled to under ORC 3202 could not be paid out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I agreed with Ms Jayaram’s argument. This was an appropriate case in which leave should be granted to the Defendant to make the interim judgment final. The Plaintiff had not participated in the previous hearings. He was absent at the hearing of the Defendant’s application for discovery in SUM 3324.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Further, despite being notified of the hearing dates, the Plaintiff did not participate in the subsequent case conferences,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> or the hearing of the ancillary matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Plaintiff’s conduct suggests that he had decided to not participate in the proceedings. Given this, it was equally likely that he would not take action to make final the interim judgment granted on his Statement of Claim. The result of such inaction would result in the Wife being unable to move on. This was clearly an untenable situation that could not be countenanced. I therefore granted the Defendant leave to make the interim judgment final.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This summons was heard on 23 November 2023 and orders were made.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the Case Conferences held on 3 January 2024, 14 February 2024, 27 March 2024, and 8 of May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Plaintiff was absent from the hearing on 19 June 2024 and 18 July 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for payment of fixed sum in monthly instalments should be interpreted to be a maintenance order or an order dividing matrimonial assets","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Variation of consent order – Whether order for monthly instalment payment rendered unworkable due to change in payor’s financial situation","Family law – Maintenance – Variation of maintenance order – Whether the loss of employment income and remarriage amount to a material change of circumstances"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 818 of 2020 (Summons No. 3761 of 2023)","title":"XCJ v XCK","citation":"[2024] SGFC 73","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32085-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Kee Lay Lian and Mr Shawn Teo (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the Plaintiff","Mr Yap Teong Liang (TL Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XCJ v XCK</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCJ <em>v</em> XCK </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32085-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 73</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

If so, should the Order be made?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Do Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order relate to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, or are they maintenance orders?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Has the Husband satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify his application to vary Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Can the Husband rely on his present circumstances – including his current employment status and/or remarriage – to vary Order 7(a) of the AM Order, and remove his obligation to pay the Wife maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I will address each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Can the Family Court make the Sale Order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this Section, I will set out my views on the nature and scope of the Sale Order sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. In doing so, I will assume <em>arguendo</em> there was some evidential and/or legal basis to vary the AM Order. I will discuss further whether the AM Order should, in fact, be varied in greater detail at [71] to [88] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Husband referred this Court to r 540(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”) and submitted that this rule empowers the Family Court in Singapore to order the sale of immovable property (including those located in a foreign country). According to counsel, all the Husband needs to show is that it is “<em>necessary and expedient</em>” for such an order to be made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the matter, I am unable to agree with counsel’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, the Husband has confused the Family Court’s <em>power</em> to make an order of a certain nature (for eg. the sale of a property) with its <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the matter (or dispute) in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is trite that a court’s power and its jurisdiction refer to different matters – jurisdiction is the court’s “<em>authority, however derived, to hear and determine</em>” a dispute, whereas a court’s power is its “<em>capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party”</em>: see <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0258.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 258</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This is especially important in the present context as the Family Court was exercising its <em>matrimonial jurisdiction</em> when it made the AM Order after the Husband had invoked the Family Court’s jurisdiction by filing divorce proceedings pursuant to the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In hearing SUM 3671, I am also exercising the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear an application to <em>vary</em> the AM Order. Thus, if I am to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, I would be doing so as part of the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Court of Appeal in <em>UDA v UDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> was clear in holding that the Family Court’s power to divide assets “<em>or the sale of any such asset</em>” under s 112, WC operates only between the parties to the marriage and has force only “<em>between the parties</em>”;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> the Family Court cannot, in exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction, make orders against third parties in respect of assets and/or properties held by such third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this regard, the Husband’s reliance on r 540(1), FJR unfortunately misses the point as that is clearly a procedural rule. The Court of Appeal in <em>UDA</em> observed that where the jurisdiction which the party “<em>was advocating for did not exist</em>”, he or she “<em>could not create it by invoking a procedural rule</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In fact, the Husband’s own written submissions referred this Court to the High Court’s decision in <em>Tan Poh Beng v Choo Lee Mei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0163.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 163</a> where the High Court made the following apposite observations (at [19] of its judgment) in respect of O 31, r 1 of the Rules of Court 2014 (which is <em>in pari materia</em> to r 540, FJR):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19 […] The court’s power under both the SCJA and the ROC to order the sale of a property is contingent on there <b>being a substantive legal basis to justify the exercise of that power.

In this regard, it bears noting that both para 2 of the First Schedule and O 31 r 1 refer to the need for a “cause or matter” relating to any land or immovable property […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Rule 540, FJR does not provide the Family Court with an unfettered free-standing power. It can only be invoked against parties who are already within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As such, even if I were to assume that there were reasons justifying the variation of the AM Order, I do not have the power to make the Sale Order in respect of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is not disputed that neither the Husband nor the Wife is an owner of the Brussels Properties. Indeed, Order 1 of the AM Order <em>expressly</em> states that the Brussel Properties are being held by a foreign company, ie. [A] (“A Co”). In his affidavit, the Husband exhibited a company profile search of A Co indicating that the Wife, their daughter (ie. [V]), and one [T], are the administrators and members of A Co’s board.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In other words, if I were to make the Sale Order sought by the Husband, a Family Court in Singapore would be effectively ordering a corporate entity in Belgium (ie. A Co) – of whom the Husband is neither an administrator nor board member, and the Wife being only 1 of 3 board members – to sell <em>the corporate entity’s</em> properties located <em>in Belgium</em> because of matrimonial proceedings between the Husband and the Wife in Singapore. I do not find that it is appropriate or proper for this Court to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is especially so given that Prayer 1 of SUM 3761 asks that this Court order the sale of the Brussels Properties “<em>and for the sale proceeds arising from the said sale to be </em><b><em>equally </em></b><em>distributed to the </em><b><em>Defendant and the Plaintiff</em></b> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]”; the Husband is asking this Court to compel A Co (who is not a party to the proceedings) to not only divest itself of its properties, but to also order that the sale proceeds therefrom be paid to the Wife and the Husband directly, despite neither of them being an owner of the Brussels Properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During oral submissions, when I queried the Husband’s counsel on the legal effect and/or basis for this Court to order A Co to sell the Brussels Properties, counsel submitted that I could simply order that the Brussels Properties “be sold” and leave it to the Husband, the Wife and/or A Co to “sort out” amongst themselves how such an order would be implemented overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I am again unable to accept the Husband’s counsel’s submission, not least because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Counsel’s submission represented a significant departure from what was sought in Prayer 1 of SUM 3761. Counsel was thus advancing a completely different case from that stated in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and what was written in the Husband’s own affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> without any prior notice given to the Wife (or her counsel) of such a change. This meant that the Wife was deprived of any opportunity to adduce the necessary evidence, or raise the relevant legal challenges, to address this new request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any case, I found such a request to be wholly ambiguous, and what was sought could hardly be called an “order” in the first place. It is unclear to whom is this order for sale directed against, and who is required to comply with it?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the reasons I have set out above, I find that it is not within this Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to hear disputes relating to (or make orders against) assets held by a third party, such as A Co. If I were to make an open-ended order for the Brussels Properties to be sold, only the Husband and the Wife would possibly be bound by such an order, yet neither of them is the legal owner of the said Properties which could unilaterally effect the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The uncertainty inherent in such an order would lead to difficulties in <em>enforcing</em> the same since it is not clear who is supposed to do what, in order to comply with a broadly worded order requiring “the sale of the Brussels Properties”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Accordingly, I do not find any legal basis to support the Husband’s application in this regard. Prayer 1 of the SUM 3761 is thus dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I should add that the Husband had referred, in his affidavit, to Orders 4 and 6 of the AM Order as orders which already envisaged the possible sale of the Brussels Properties, and that all he is requesting this Court to do is to intervene by making the Sale Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the presence of Orders 4 and 6 did not assist the Husband at all. If anything, Order 4 made clear that a sale of the Brussels Properties would only occur “<em>in the event that the parties agree</em>” and even then, the proceeds of any such sale would be made available to “<em>shareholders</em>” (and not directly to the Husband).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     These Orders do not justify the Court ordering the sale of the Brussels Properties without both parties’ consent, and certainly not for the vesting of any sale proceeds therefrom in the Husband or the Wife directly. For reasons I would come to below, this Court should be slow to intervene and effectively rewrite the parties’ agreement (as set out in the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Interpretation of the AM Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I will now move on to address the next question – ie. what is the nature of Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order. The parties took opposing positions on this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband argued that this Court should look at the “substance” of these Orders and find that they were “maintenance orders”, whereas the Wife submitted that these were orders which divided the parties’ matrimonial assets (which, for ease of reference, I will refer to as “division orders”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The distinction between maintenance orders and division orders is significant in the present case because the legal principles applicable to varying maintenance orders are different from those relating to the variation of division orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Both parties accept that maintenance orders may be varied if there has been a material change in the parties’ circumstances: see ss 118 and 119, WC. On the other hand, if the orders in question were division orders, then this Court can only vary them if the Husband could show that the said orders were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM</em>”) at [22] – [23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Accordingly, it fell on this Court to interpret/construe Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order in order to determine their nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In this regard, the High Court in <em>Seah Kim Seng v Yick Sui Ping</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17865-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 731</a>, made the following instructive observations on the relevance of the parties’ intention when considering the terms of a consent order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the fact that a consent order was recorded means that the intention of the respective parties may be relevant in a broad sense; such intention has to be considered in the light of the compromise required in reaching an agreement and expressed in the consent order. What matters ultimately is the common understanding between the parties. The court cannot ultimately substitute its own agreement in place of what the parties came to…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In <em>WWC v WWD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31395-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 17</a>, this Court had similarly observed that when interpreting consent orders containing terms drafted primarily by the parties (or their solicitors), the court can have regard to principles of contractual interpretation to aid in ascertaining the meaning of the words used in the consent order, being careful to explain that the use of such principles did not equate to the wholesale importation of the law of contract.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It was further observed that primacy should still be accorded to the <em>text</em> and <em>language</em> used in the said order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having considered the evidence, I find that Orders 3a, 5, 8, 9a of the AM Order are division orders, and not maintenance orders. I reach this conclusion having regard to both the text and context of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Text of the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I start by addressing Order 3 of the AM Order. This was an order of some import as it referred to the total amount payable by the Husband (ie. EUR 3.9 million) and the manner this sum was to be paid (ie. in equal instalments totalling EUR 32,500 per instalment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the language and text of Order 3 as well as its preamble were clear – the Order expressly stated that the Husband must pay the Wife various amounts “<em>as a liquidation for the marital assets</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Given the express reference to the “<em>liquidation</em>” of the parties’ “<em>marital assets</em>”, I find that the Order could not possibly be read as (or bear the meaning of) an order relating to the payment of spousal <em>maintenance</em> or alimony as suggested by the Husband. It was an order relating to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets under s 112 of the WC. Indeed, s 112(5)(g) of the WC expressly allows the Family Court to order one party to pay another party a sum of money, and s 112(6) permits any order for the payment of money to be carried out in instalments. Such an understanding of Order 3 was consistent with both the language of Order 3 and the legal framework under which a division order can be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The language of Order 3a can be juxtaposed against Order 7a of the AM Order where the latter Order expressly provided for the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of EUR 2,000 per month “<em>as monthly maintenance</em>”, which may be increased after 2035 for the Wife “<em>to maintain a substantially similar lifestyle</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The references to “marital assets” (in the preamble of Order 3) and to the aggregate amounts payable (eg. “EUR 2,100,000” and “EUR 1,800,000” in Orders 3a and 3b, respectively) stand in stark contrast to phrases such as “<em>maintenance</em>” and/or the Wife’s “<em>lifestyle</em>” (as used in Order 7a). The parties’ deliberate choice to use different references and phrases demonstrated their understanding of the differences between maintenance orders and division orders, and that they had intended for Order 3 and Order 7 to have different legal effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As regards Order 5, this Order expressly referred to Order 3a and was also intended to be a division order. Put simply, Order 5 related to how the payment obligations in Order 3 would be extinguished with the effect that the debt cannot be claimed against the Husband’s estate upon his death.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Counsel for the Husband submitted that the reference in Order 5 to the existence of an insurance policy reflected the Husband’s attempt to ensure that his family (ie. the Wife and [V]) would be provided for in the event of his death. According to counsel, this could be seen as part of the Husband’s effort to “maintain” his family and was arguably a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I found this argument to be equivocal, at best.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     There was some force in the Wife’s counsel’s rebuttal that the references to an insurance payout could also support the view that the Husband recognised Order 3 as a division order. This is because had Order 3 truly been intended to be a maintenance order, the Husband’s obligation to pay maintenance would have extinguished automatically upon his death as a matter of law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and there would have been no need for him to provide for an insurance payout to prevent the Wife from making a claim for outstanding payments against his estate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     With respect to Orders 8 and 9a, I similarly find that they were not maintenance orders but were orders which are consequential to, or are meant to implement, the other division orders contained in the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Both Orders referred to the Brussels Properties and A Co (which is referred to as the “<em>Company</em>” in the AM Order) and addressed how the parties should regulate their conduct <em>inter se</em> given the Husband’s unique capacity as an <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares held by the parties’ daughter, [V] (an issue which I will address further below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Context and circumstances surrounding the AM Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I next consider the context and circumstances at the time the AM Order was entered into by consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As stated above, <em>both</em> parties were legally represented in February 2021 when the AM Order was made. Drafts of the orders were exchanged between both parties’ solicitors (including the parties’ themselves) leading up to finalisation of the draft consent order (which eventually became the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The various drafts and amended versions of the draft consent order, together with the covering emails sent by the parties and/or their solicitors, were exhibited in their respective affidavits filed in these proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> From a perusal of these documents, it was clear that one of the parties’ key concerns was the need to avoid the situation where Order 3 of the initial draft consent order would be classified as an order for “spousal support” thereby attracting tax implications in Belgium according to the Wife’s tax advisors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This concern was made known to the Husband, and it was eventually agreed between the parties that Order 3 would state that it related to the <em>liquidation</em> of the marital assets (or the concept of “<em>liquidation-partage du regime matrimonial</em>” under Belgian law), the latter phrase being inserted into a draft circulated <em>by the Husband</em> himself, in November 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In these proceedings, the Husband argued that the exchange of correspondence – including an alleged internal “explanation” as to how the <em>numerical figures</em> of EUR 2.1 million and EUR 1. 8 million in Order 3a and 3b, respectively, were calculated (written in “[ ]” in the later versions of the draft consent order circulated),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> supported his argument that parties intended for Order 3 to be a form of maintenance payments to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Again, I am unable to agree with the Husband’s argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Instead, I accept the Wife’s submission that the correspondence exchanged demonstrated that the parties had <em>specifically applied their minds</em> to how the draft consent order was to be crafted and that they intended for Order 3 to be a division order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Both parties had agreed that they did not want Order 3 to be deemed by the foreign tax authority as a maintenance (or alimony) order and had made sure that Order 3 was intended to be a division order so as not to attract any tax implications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     It follows that Order 5, which is meant to be read together with Order 3, was intended by the parties to also be part of the division of their marital assets, and not a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Indeed, accepting the Husband’s argument would be to accept that the parties had privately wanted (and understood) Order 3 to be a maintenance order but had intentionally drafted the clause in an obscure (or possibly, duplicitous) manner with the sole purpose to evade foreign tax obligations. This is a very serious claim involving fraud and dishonesty committed on both foreign tax authorities as well as the court. I am not persuaded that the documents submitted evidence the presence of any such conduct and/or intentions between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I thus find that both parties agreed for Orders 3 and 5 to be read and understood as division orders, and that was their intention when the AM Order was made in February 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I next address Orders 8 and 9. In considering the context under which these Orders were made, it is important to appreciate that by the time of the AM Order in February 2021, the Husband had already divested the legal ownership of his shares in A Co (and through that, the Brussels Properties) to [V].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     It was not disputed by both parties and their foreign law experts, that the Husband was and remains a <em>usufructuary</em> of the A Co shares. The <em>usufruct</em> regime under Belgian law is such that the bare legal title/ownership of an asset (ie. the “<em>nue-propriété</em>”) may be vested in one owner while the right to use the property and enjoy the “fruits” of the same (for <em>eg.</em> dividends and income therefrom) are vested in another person (ie. the <em>usufructuary</em>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In the present case, [V] is the owner of the bare legal title, and the Husband is the <em>usufructuary</em>. Both parties’ foreign law experts have referred to Article 3.138 of the Belgian Civil Code, the English translation of which states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Usufruct grants its holder the temporary right to use and enjoy, in a prudent and reasonable manner, a property belonging to the bare-owner, in accordance with the purpose of the property and with the obligation to return it at the end of their right.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I accept the Wife’s expert, Ms C’s, explanation that the <em>usufruct</em> regime does not grant the <em>usufructuary</em> (ie. the Husband) the right to sell/dispose the assets subject to the <em>usufruct</em> (ie. the A Co shares in the present case). Where both the legal owner and the <em>usufructuary</em> agree to sell the asset in question, then the latter may be entitled to claim compensation arising from the loss of his rights, enjoyment and use of the asset (as a result of its disposal). The <em>usufructuary</em>, however, cannot act unilaterally to sell the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     When viewed in this context, it becomes clear that Orders 8 and 9 were intended to be division orders regulating the use of the Brussels Properties and the shareholding of A Co.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     While both these assets are no longer legally owned by the Husband, he remains a <em>usufructuary</em> and has the right to make decisions over the use of A Co shares (and its fruits). This, in turn, necessitated the use of language such as “<em>the Defendant</em> [ie. the Wife] <em>will be allowed by the Plaintiff</em> [ie. the Husband] <b><em>(directly or indirectly)</em></b><em>, to become the tenant of the Brussels Properties…</em> [emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]” in Order 8. The need to provide for the possible “indirect” authorisation by the Husband arose from the fact that he is no longer the legal owner of the A Co shares, but its <em>usufructuary</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion of Interpretation of the AM Order and its consequence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For the foregoing reasons, I find that Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 were orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets, and <em>not</em> maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     For completeness, the Husband did not raise the existence of any mistake, misrepresentation nor did he claim that the AM Order was procured by fraud. In any case, such a claim would also have been difficult to maintain given that both parties were represented by solicitors at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Accordingly, contrary to his counsel’s submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> the Husband cannot rely on ss 118 or 119, WC as the legal basis to vary Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order; this Court cannot vary these Orders because of an alleged “<em>material change in circumstances</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Instead, the Husband can only rely on s 112(4), WC and must demonstrate that these Orders were “unworkable” or have become “unworkable”, as held by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The AM Order is not unworkable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     At the outset, in considering whether Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 of the AM Order were (or have become) unworkable, I observe that the Husband’s counsel did not include in their written submissions any legal arguments on the issue of unworkability. Presumably, this is because the main plank of the Husband’s case is that he is entitled to rely on alleged material changes in his circumstances to vary the said Orders (which I do not accept, for the reasons set out above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Nevertheless, counsel did indicate, during the hearing of SUM 3761, that they are relying on broadly the same grounds (ie. a change in the Husband’s circumstances) to show that the Orders have become unworkable. I also take into consideration the fact that the Husband’s affidavit did mention (albeit in passing) that the terms of the AM Order were “<em>unworkable</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I am therefore satisfied that was no prejudice being caused to the Wife and/or or that she had been taken by surprise by the Husband’s claim that the AM Orders have become unworkable. Indeed, the Wife’s written submissions specifically addressed the issue of the AM Orders’ unworkability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     That said, having considered the matter, I do not find any of Orders 3, 5, 8 and 9 to be unworkable (whether at its inception, or that they have become unworkable due to subsequent events). I therefore see no basis to vary any of these orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     To begin with, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em> was careful to explain that the power under s 112(4), WC does not give a court <em>carte blanche</em> to vary an order and that the power must be exercised only in exceptional situations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The Court of Appeal further held as follows (<em>AYM</em> at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    However, even assuming that the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court has not been completely effected or implemented, there still remains the issue as to the <em>grounds</em> on which the court would vary an order already made. <b>In our view, the fundamental importance of finality in the context of the division of matrimonial assets would also apply here</b>. To this end, we are of the view that the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets <em>only</em> where the order was <em>unworkable</em> or <em>has become unworkable</em> (<em>but before</em> it has been fully effected or implemented). We would however, point out, parenthetically, that the courts would not look favourably upon frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of court, which applications would be subject, <em>inter alia</em>, to the appropriate costs orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In the present case, there was nothing in the Husband’s affidavits which suggests that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were unworkable <em>ab initio</em>. In fact, the Husband had complied with those orders in the years following the making of the AM Order, making them clearly workable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> I therefore understood the Husband’s case to be the narrower claim that the AM Order has become unworkable due to subsequent events – ie. his loss of employment and his remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     As regards when new and/or subsequent circumstances can cause a division order to “become unworkable”, the Court of Appeal held that the new circumstances which have emerged since the order must “<em>so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which is radically different from what was originally intended.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78      <em>AYM</em> was a case where a husband whose business had failed, and who claimed that he had been unable to find a job, applied to vary a division order made by consent. The consent order provided for the parties’ matrimonial property to be sold only after 6 years and for the sale proceeds to be distributed between the parties thereafter, with the wife obtaining a larger share. The husband sought orders for the property to be sold within 3 months, and for the sale proceeds to be <em>inter alia</em> divided equally. Both the District Judge and the High Court dismissed the husband’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In upholding the lower courts’ decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the variation of the consent order, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    Turning to the facts of the present appeal, we agree with the Judge’s decision. It is clear, in our view, <b>that the change in circumstances which the Husband prayed in aid fell far short of the radical change in circumstances</b> referred to above (at [25]) and did not amount to the order becoming unworkable. <b>Even if business failure and a loss of income amounted to a “material change in the circumstances” sufficient to justify a variation of an order for maintenance, they did not suffice in the present case to justify the invocation of s 112(4) in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned</b>. It should also be noted that the order concerned was the result of a <em>consent order</em> between the Husband and the Wife (and see generally above at [15]). Indeed, the Husband was, in the final analysis, merely attempting to obtain a further amount because the matrimonial asset concerned was now worth more than what the parties had originally thought (see above at [3]). <b>Such attempts to undermine the finality of orders with regard to the division of matrimonial assets are wholly undesirable as well as unmeritorious and are, indeed, the very antithesis of the rationale underlying such orders in the first place, and aptly demonstrate the dangers of a wide interpretation of s 112(4)</b>. If, indeed, he had suffered a loss of income which amounted to a material change of circumstances, his proper course should have been to seek to vary the order for the payment of maintenance, rather than to seek to reopen the order with regard to the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In my view, the alleged changes in circumstances relied on by the Husband, like those referred to in <em>AYM</em>, fell far short of what was needed to vary a division order made by consent (ie. the AM Order).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Even if I were to accept that the Husband had lost his employment, and was unable to find a suitable job thereafter, the alleged change in his employment situation was simply not sufficient to justify varying the carefully negotiated division orders set out in AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     To recapitulate, the evidence tendered by the parties showed that they had reached an agreement on the terms of the divorce (and the eventual draft consent order) after a long period of negotiations between the parties and their respective solicitors. This negotiated settlement, which was reached early in the proceedings (before any discovery and/or financial disclosures was ordered), meant that the draft consent order reflected the bargain struck between the parties without the need for either of them to undertake an extensive investigation of each other’s assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     It was within this context that the Husband had agreed to provide the Wife with the amounts stated in Order 3 as being <em>inter alia</em> her share of the parties’ overall matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     In this regard, Choo J’s observations in the recent decision of <em>WRP v WRQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31044-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 12</a> are apposite:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…Although the idea of sanctity of contract is not applied directly in matrimonial proceedings as if they were commercial enterprises, weight is given to the negotiated settlement of the parties. <u>Much give and take are involved in reaching such settlements, and the court should keep this in mind lest it gives more to the taker by taking more from the giver, contrary to the parties’ intentions</u>…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Put another way, the Husband’s application to vary the AM Order and change the amount payable to the Wife or the period/mode in which payment is to be made to her, is effectively a request for him to rewrite the carefully negotiated agreement between the parties even though it is not clear what was the exact “give-and-take” which the parties had agreed to when they entered into the original settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     As regards the Husband’s remarriage, I find that this is not a valid basis to seek a variation of the AM Order. Indeed, given the Husband’s decision to marry his current wife on 3 May 2021 (which was less than 1 month after the Certificate of Final Judgment was issued on 12 April 2021),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> he would have been fully aware of his legal obligations under the AM Order and cannot rely on his decision to remarry as a basis to re-write the terms of his divorce which was finalised just one month before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Lastly, insofar as the Husband relied on the Wife’s alleged actions arising from the sale of the Swiss property (referred to in Order 2 of the AM Order) or her actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> A Co’s bank account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that these were matters which, at their highest, relate to the parties’ compliance with the AM Order or the <em>enforcement</em> of the AM Order; they were not justifications for its variation. The difference between the enforcement of a court order and the need for its variation was a matter which the Husband clearly understood, having referred to the same in his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In reaching the conclusions above, I have assumed <em>arguendo</em> that the Husband was (and remains) impecunious and/or lacked the ability to draw an income similar to what he was earning in February 2021. This assumption was made to illustrate that even if the Husband’s circumstances had indeed changed (as he had alleged), the AM Order had not become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     However, for the reasons set out at [98] below, I find that the Husband has not sufficiently discharged his burden to prove any alleged change in circumstances to justify a variation of the AM Order on account of alleged unworkability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order 7 of the AM Order should not be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In this Section, I will address whether Order 7a of the AM Order (which both parties accept was meant to be a maintenance order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>) should be varied because of the Husband’s alleged change of circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     In respect of this issue, the Wife submitted that the Husband did not substantiate his claim that there was an alleged change in circumstances given his “[failure] <em>to produce any evidence related to his bank accounts, investments accounts and/or other related information of his financial resources, including how he is funding his own monthly expenses and that of his current wife and child</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I agree with this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In my view, the lack of evidence from the Husband was significant and inimical to his claim that he was (or remains) in dire financial straits. Being the applicant in a variation application, the burden fell on the Husband to prove his inability to meet his maintenance obligation, and he failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I do not agree with his counsel’s argument that the Court must accept that there has been a material change in the Husband’s circumstances simply because it is an allegedly “<em>incontrovertible fact</em>” that the Husband’s income has changed since the time of the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Even if I am prepared to accept that the Husband’s:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_a\"></a>(a)     latest of income tax Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2023 shows that he had earned approximately $500,000 that year, as compared to the $2.1 million annual income he had earned in 2021; and/or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_94-p2_b\"></a>(b)     current affiliation with [NWA Co] was merely on an <em>ad hoc</em> unremunerated basis,</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>that did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the Husband had proved his case that he was unable to meet his maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     As the Husband’s own counsel noted in their written submissions,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> the Court of Appeal in <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<em>BZD</em>”) emphasised that “[i]<em>n examining the question of material change in circumstances, the inquiry is not simply whether there has been any material change per se since the</em> [maintenance order]. <em>The change must be sufficiently material such that it is no longer fair to expect the status quo to remain</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     To ascertain whether it is fair for the Order 7 (or any part thereof) to remain, the Court would have to undertake a proper and holistic assessment of the Husband’s current financial situation to determine whether he can still afford to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In particular, s 114(1), WC expressly provides that when determining the amount of maintenance to be paid to a former wife, the court must have regard to all circumstances of the case including “<em>the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has…</em>”. It follows that when deciding whether to reduce (or, in this case, completely remove) the Wife’s entitlement to spousal maintenance in the AM Order, the Court must similarly consider the Husband’s overall financial resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I thus agree with the Wife’s submission that “<em>there</em> [was] <em>no evidence to support</em> [the Husband’s] <em>contention that his financial resources have been completely depleted</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> In fact, the Husband did not provide <em>any evidence</em> as to how much money he currently has. Accordingly, I do not find that he has proven that there has been any <em>material</em> change of circumstances which warrants the variation of Order 7 of the AM Order – an order which requires him to pay <em>inter alia</em> EUR 2,000 per month to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In conclusion, I find that Orders 3, 5 8 and 9 of the AM Order were orders for the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. These Orders (or any part thereof) can only be varied, pursuant to s 112(4) of the WC, if the Husband can demonstrate that they were unworkable <em>ab initio</em> or have become unworkable. The Husband has failed to do so, based on the evidence he had submitted in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    It follows that there is no basis for the Court to now delete the aforesaid Orders from the AM Order, or for the Court to make a free-standing order relating to the sale of Brussels Properties and/or to distribute the proceeds therefrom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    With respect to Order 7 of the AM Order, although this was a maintenance order which could be varied pursuant to ss 118 and 119 of the WC, I find that the Husband did not discharge his burden to prove the existence of a material change of circumstances and there is similarly no basis to vary the provision of spousal maintenance stated therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Accordingly, the Husband’s application <em>vide</em>.

In the present matter, the Defendant Father seeks to appeal against my refusal to lift a suspended committal order against the Plaintiff Mother. The trouble began in August 2020, which was the last time the Father had substantive access with his son, now a teenager of nearly 14 years (referred to as the child, or “A” in quoted extracts). The Father had applied for a committal order on 3 March 2022, and after a bitterly fought trial, I granted a suspended order of committal against the Mother on 9 February 2023 in FC/ORC 1295/2023 (“the Committal Order”). The Mother was directed therein to exercise all reasonable effort to ensure the presence of her child at the handover for access, on pain of a $5,000 fine should she fail to do so. While the Mother managed to produce the child on some occasions since the Committal Order, substantive access never occurred as the child refused to leave the premises with the Father. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Father filed FC/SUM 3087/2023 (“the Application”) on 26 September 2023 to lift the suspended Committal Order against the Plaintiff Mother, on the basis that she had failed to provide access on 27 occasions during seven months from February 2023 to August 2023. The Father also sought for the fine of $5,000 provided for in that the Committal Order to be substituted with a term of imprisonment of four weeks. For good measure, his position had escalated at the end of trial to requesting the court to reverse care and control of the child to his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 30 April 2024, I found that the Father had not proven that the Mother was in breach of the Committal Order and dismissed the Application. The Father filed an appeal against my decision on 13 May 2024. I now provide my detailed grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is apposite to trace the complicated background between the parties to better appreciate the context behind this latest round of litigation. The parties were married in 2007 and filed for divorce in 2011. Interim judgment was granted on 28 May 2012. Parties had agreed by consent for care and control of the only child of the marriage, a boy born in 2010 and then aged nearly three years, to be granted to the Mother, with supervised access to the Father during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays, subject to a review after six months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father was back in court in 2013, applying for a variation of the ancillary orders on division and access. On 18 November 2013, the court varied the ancillary orders (in ORC 17253/2013), granting assisted access twice a week (once during the weekday and once during the weekend), subject to further review. In the review held in 2014, the parents agreed by consent for the Father to have weekday dinner access each week, weekend access every alternate Friday evening to Sunday evening, and alternating public holiday access (subject to the Father having access on Deepavali and Vesak Day and the Mother having access on the Hari Raya holidays).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Disaster then struck. The Mother and Child were involved in an accident, and both were hospitalised with serious injuries. In 2015, the Father applied (in FC/SUM 997/2015) to vary the child orders to obtain sole care and control of the Child. In the course of lengthy litigation, a series of interim orders were given that directed the Mother to provide access to the Father every Friday evening to Sunday evening, by way of assisted transfer. At a hearing on 20 January 2016, the Mother was warned by the court that should she continue to deny access, care and control may be reversed. The Father’s application for reversal of care and control was eventually dismissed on 1 March 2016, with access varied to alternate weekends (Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm), and daytime Sunday access on all other weekends from 9 am to 9 pm, as well as weekly access on a weekday from 6-9 pm. At a review on 23 May 2016, the court fixed the weekday access on Monday, and again warned the Mother that if the situation did not improve, reversal of care and control would be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father appealed against this decision (in HCF/DCA 117/2016), and after attempts at mediation, the orders given were varied by the High Court on 25 September 2017 (“the 2017 Order”, which was only extracted subsequently as HCF/ORC 13/2022). The 2017 Order contains the current applicable access orders. Its terms are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Overnight weekend access every alternate week from Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm, and on other weekends, access from Sunday 9 am to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Dinnertime access on Monday 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Telephone/skype/facetime access every evening between 7 pm to 7:30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Access on Father’s Day and the child’s birthday on alternate years beginning 2017 from 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Alternate public holiday access, with access to the Father for Deepavali. No access to the Father if his access falls on the eve or actual day of Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Haji.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Father is to pick up the child from the Mother’s residence at the lift lobby and return the child to the Mother’s residence thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_g\"></a>(g)     No cancellation of access by the Mother even if the child has a medical certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The Father has overnight access for half of school holidays beginning November/December 2017, save for the last week of December.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       A period of normalcy then followed. Access did occur with a fair degree of regularity thereafter from September 2017 to about August 2020. The parties (and their families) however continued to bicker, and matters came to a head with police reports filed over altercations at the handover of the child on 16 and 23 August 2020. The Father did not have substantive access to the child after those dates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       This set the stage for the present round of litigation. The Father filed for committal on 3 March 2022, for breaches of access committed from 22 October 2017 to 4 November 2021. Over the course of a protracted and bitterly fought committal hearing, the court made attempts to repair the relationship by giving a series of interim directions for the parties to resume access in good faith. When access failed to materialise, the court directed interim access to be attempted over three hours at a nearby mall. This attempt likewise did not succeed. Finally, on 2 December 2022, after a Judge and Child Session held with the assistance of a court family specialist, interim directions were given for video call access twice a week for no less than 15 minutes per session. There was a glimmer of hope with remote access, which proceeded over some occasions (on 24 and 29 December 2022), with direct communications over WhatsApp taking place between the Father and child over the December 2022 school holidays. Nevertheless, no substantive access was achieved, and the Father persisted with the committal action.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 9 February 2023, I found the Mother guilty of contempt of court in relation to the 2017 Order by failing to take reasonable steps to facilitate the Father’s access on 38 occasions, over a period from 2 October 2017 to 4 November 2021. A fine of $5,000 was imposed in respect of these breaches, with the order of committal suspended pursuant to Rule 763 of the Family Justice Rules on the following conditions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother complies with the terms of access provided for in HCF/ORC 13/2022 dated 25 September 2017;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother exercises all reasonable effort to ensure that the child is present at the lift lobby of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of her residence when handing over the child for access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is to inform the Father at the earliest possible opportunity should she be unable to ensure that the child so complies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties and the Child shall attend counselling by the FAM/DSSA Centre, which shall commence no later than 31 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In my brief grounds of decision (at [4]), I also exhorted parties to avoid further litigation, which would be counterproductive to the restoration of the father-child relationship:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Nevertheless, I do urge parties to exercise patience and forbearance in future arrangements in relation to access. The child is now aged 12 and has a mind of his own, and while it is clearly the Mother’s responsibility to exercise all reasonable effort to compel him to comply with access terms, it would be counterproductive to do so at every turn upon the threat of further committal action against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Unfortunately, this advice was not heeded. Frustrated at the lack of substantive access since the Committal Order in February 2023, the Father filed the present Application some seven months later on 26 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Evidence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The parties have each filed an affidavit in the Application:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father filed his supporting affidavit on 6 October 2023 (“F1”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother filed her affidavit in reply on 19 January 2024 (“M1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Application was heard over three half day trial fixtures on 29 January, 6 and 19 March 2024, with submissions and decision rendered on 30 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I would also note for the record that on the day fixed for submissions, counsel for the Mother requested for a second Judge and Child session to be conducted with the child (the first session having been conducted earlier on 2 December 2022 in the course of the committal proceedings), or in the alternative, to allow the child speak in open court about the occasions of access. I declined to accede, as the hearing had already been concluded with submissions tendered, and no advance notice had been given of such an application. Nevertheless, I did direct for there to be a meeting between the Father and the child in the presence of a court family specialist, with the hope that some progress toward sustainable access be made at the eleventh hour. However, no headway was made at this discussion, and decision was therefore rendered by the court later that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father initially claimed that access had been denied over 27 occasions from 11 February 2023 to 27 August 2023. In the course of trial, the Father admitted that he did not actually attend for access on two of these dates (4 March 2023 and 2 April 2023), and withdrew his allegations accordingly. The matter thus proceeded on denial of access over 25 occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father’s case was that out of the 25 occasions, the child did turn up for seven occasions at the second floor lift lobby outside his residence as directed. However, on all those occasions, the child decided not to leave with the Father. The Father further alleged that the child did not turn up for access on the remaining 18 occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father alleges that the Mother had not taken all reasonable effort to compel the child to go through with access. He challenged the Mother to show she had taken such efforts, and pointed out that the Mother had undermined him in her admission that she had affirmed the child’s negative sentiments about the Father by agreeing that the Father was “stupid” and “dumb”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father also alleges that the Mother’s actions had alienated the child from him and worsened their relationship. He asserts that the Mother must have shown the child messages from the Mother to the Father which alleged that he was a lousy father, that he was dumb, bankrupt and a fool. The Father came to this conclusion on the basis that the child had access to the Mother’s phone and could view her messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. He posits that there cannot be any other reason why a child would otherwise reject a parent with whom he previously enjoyed a good relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s Position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother denied that she had been in breach of the terms imposed in the Committal Order or the underlying access terms in the 2017 Order. She relies on four arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     First, in relation to the seven occasions where the child had turned up for access at the lift lobby outside their home, the Mother claims it was the unpleasant manner in which the Father spoke to the child on these occasions which made the child turn back and refuse to continue with access. She submitted video recordings from her home CCTV camera with accompanying transcripts to substantiate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Second, the Mother submits that on occasions where the Father turned up too early or too late for access without sufficient notice, no amount of reasonable steps could be taken to compel the child to turn up for access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Third, after the harsh words exchanged by the Father with the child in their final meeting on 21 May 2023, it was impossible for the Mother to take any reasonable steps to compel the child to go for access, as he was old enough to make his own decisions and had a mind of his own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Fourth, on one occasion (19 March 2023), the Mother informed the Father that the child could not turn up for access as he had fever after taking his Covid-19 booster shot. While she acknowledged that the 2017 Order specified that access should not be cancelled even with a medical certificate, she interpreted that the Father had acquiesced to this cancellation of access as he did not object at the material time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     It is well established that the standard of proof for contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, per <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18910-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1</a> at [85]. As regards the requisite <em>mens rea</em> to establish breach of court orders, the applicant need only prove that the conduct of the party in breach was intentional and that the party knew that such conduct was a breach (at [86]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When determining whether there has been a breach of the Committal Order or the terms of access, a two-step approach is generally adopted, per <em>UNE v UNF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23079-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 9</a> (“UNE”) at [3], citing <em>PT Sandipala Arthaputrav STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</em> and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22139-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 828</a> (“PT Sandipala”) at [46]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the court would decide what exactly the order of court required the alleged contemnor to do. In determining what the order of court required, the court will interpret the plain meaning of the language used, and any ambiguity would be resolved in favour of the person who had to comply with the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the court would determine whether the requirements of the order of court had been fulfilled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It is also clear that the court has a broad discretion, if it decides to lift the suspended committal order, to sentence the contemnor for essentially a committing a <em>further</em> contempt of court, per <em>Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0218.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 218</a>, at [68]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Nonetheless, as a matter of principle, it is clearly justifiable that a court has a broad discretion in sentencing a contemnor who has breached the terms of a suspended order for committal. When an order for committal is suspended on certain terms and conditions, a breach of those terms and conditions by the contemnor is, in principle, disobedience of an order of court, and therefore a further contempt. Since the court has a complete discretion in sentencing contemnors (see [56] above), it must obviously have the same discretion in sentencing repeat contemnors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s obligations in respect of the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the purposes of the present Application, it is important to note that the Mother’s duty is not to <em>guarantee</em> that the Father has substantive access to the child. I interpret the scope of the Mother’s obligation to comply with the terms of the Committal Order, read with the 2017 Order, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother is to comply with the terms of access provided for in HCF/ORC 13/2022 dated 25 September 2017, the material points of which are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Overnight weekend access to be granted to the Father every alternate week from Saturday 9 am to Sunday 9 pm, and on other weekends, access from Sunday 9 am to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Dinnertime access on Monday from 6 pm to 9 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Alternate public holiday access, with access to the Father for Deepavali. No access to the Father if his access falls on the eve or actual day of Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Haji.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother is to exercise all reasonable effort to ensure that the child is present at the lift lobby of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of her residence when handing over the child for access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is to inform the Father at the earliest possible opportunity should she be unable to ensure that the child so complies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Access shall not be cancelled by the Mother even if the child has a medical certificate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It should be noted that the burden of proof lies with the Father, to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt, that the Mother is in breach of the <em>specific</em> obligations cited above. This bears highlighting because at various portions of his case, the Father makes the argument that it is incumbent on the Mother to show that she has satisfied her obligations under the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order. This is not correct, as it is the Father who bears the burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Mother had complied with the Committal Order read with the 2017 Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 1 – Occasions where the Child turned up for access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It was undisputed that there were seven occasions out of 25 where the child had indeed turned up for access at the second floor lift lobby outside his residence. These were on 18 February, 26 February, 11 March, 25 March, 8 April, 7 May and 21 May 2023. It was also not disputed that the child refused to leave with the Father for substantive access on these occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I did not find any basis to establish a breach of court orders on these seven occasions. The Mother’s <em>specific</em> duty was to produce the child for the purposes of access at the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor lift lobby, and this was done on the seven occasions in question. Figuratively speaking, her duty was only to bring the horse to the trough. It was the Father’s responsibility to make sure the horse drank of the water.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Over the course of trial, the Father was unable to find specific proof that the Mother had done anything to undermine his opportunity for access. His entire case on these seven occasions rests on the fact that access had been proceeding fine (i.e. prior to August 2020), and that he had had a good relationship with his son to that date, hence any failure of access could only be attributed to the fault of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As pointed out, the Father’s reasoning is flawed as the threshold to be met is that of proof beyond reasonable doubt. There was no basis to assume the fault lay with the Mother. Quite to the contrary, there are to my mind two clear reasons why the Father-child relationship had turned south following the events of 2020. The first is that the child clearly has a mind of his own, a fact which I observed during the Judge and Child session held on 2 December 2022 in the course of the committal proceedings, when the child was on the cusp of teenhood at about 12 years of age. At that time, the child was clearly aware of the impact that the protracted litigation had on his Mother, which was unfortunately complicated by the post-accident trauma experienced by the Mother. It was clear to me that the escalating tension and acrimony between the Father and Mother over the years, culminating in the altercations which took place in August 2020 and the ensuing committal proceedings filed by the Father, was the root cause why the child had turned away from his Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The second reason evident to me for the decline in the paternal relationship is that even after obtaining a Committal Order in his favour, the Father refused to let go of the hurt of the past. Rather than engaging the child afresh and focusing on the needs and wants of the child, he seemed more intent on triangulating the child in his ongoing conflict with the Mother. This persistent attitude of the Father is prominently displayed in the clips captured by the Mother’s home CCTV camera of his interactions with the child at the lift lobby on six of the seven occasions when the child turned up for access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.

This would hardly have engendered a positive reaction from the child, given the already tenuous state of the relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father’s response to the above transcripts was to question the veracity of these recordings, claiming that they were edited by the Mother. However, having heard the Mother’s explanation on how she had downloaded the clips from her home CCTV camera, I did not find any reason to doubt their authenticity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I have included the transcript of these videos above to demonstrate how the Father’s assumption that his relationship with the child was soured solely by the Mother’s alienation is fatally flawed. Instead of focusing on showing love and care for the child, and engaging the child positively on his interests and wants, the Father has instead chosen to use these precious moments of access to resurrect the ghosts of the past, which in turn elicited rude or nonchalant responses from the child. I do hope that the Father reflects on and reviews his behaviour on these occasions, so that future opportunities for access can start off with grace, forbearance and forgiveness, and evince a sincere demonstration of his care and affection for the child, rather than rehashing a litany of past hurts and grievances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 2 – Occasions where the Father did not attend for access at the appointed time</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother contends that on 10 occasions, access did not occur because the Father had arrived either too early or too late for access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I summarise the 10 occasions in question below, and note that the Father was at least 15 minutes late on all of these occasions. In the most egregious instance, he was a full six hours late. Further, despite his own tardiness, on some of these occasions, the Father had threatened to leave within five minutes if the child did not emerge.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\"

occasions which were withdrawn from the Father’s case, he had effectively stood up the child. On 4 March 2023, the Father informed that he would come at 2 pm but never arrived. On 2 April 2023, the Father did not even message to say he was not coming, and simply did not turn up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To my mind, a grace period of 15 minutes would have been fair under normal circumstances. Given the sensitivities involved and the already protracted litigation in this matter, it would have behoved the Father to turn up on time, or at least to apply the same standards (i.e. five minutes’ grace period) that he demanded of the child on himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On these occasions, mindful of the already difficult state of relations, I did not find it unreasonable for the Mother to cancel access after a fair grace period of 15 minutes had passed. It is implicit within the terms of access that the access parent must turn up on time. It would otherwise be unfair to the care parent and child to have to wait on tenterhooks for the Father to arrive at any moment, even hours after the appointed time, only to demand that the child appear within five minutes, with the obvious threat of committal should that time be exceeded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 3 – Occasions where the Child refused to attend </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     There were four occasions where the Father turned up for access but the Mother claimed that the Child refused to attend access. These were the dates of 16 April, 29 April, 13 May and 15 July 2023. The Mother submits that the Child refused to attend access due to preceding behaviour by the Father. Specifically:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With regard to 16 April 2023, the Mother explained that the child reacted to what had happened on the weekend of 8 April 2023, where the Father was rude to the child and claimed that the Mother’s residence was not the child’s home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to 29 April 2023, the Mother explained that the child was affected by the fact that the father was late and yet still sent a message that he would leave if the child is not coming out in five minutes. This was sent at 9:14 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to 13 May 2023, the Mother explained that the child was still angry over the Father’s behaviour in earlier incidents and got even angrier when the Father sent a message saying he would leave if the child was not coming out in five minutes. This was sent at 9:32 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     With regard to 15 July 2023, the Mother explained that the child was affected by the Father’s message, “If A is not out in 5 minutes or no reply, I’m leaving.” The Mother contends this affected the child and it was not possible to compel the child to see the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Father on the other hand submitted that there was no objective evidence that the child did not want to go out on those days, and neither was there evidence to show that the Mother had sufficiently encouraged him to attend. The Father also urged the court to note how the Mother had admitted to showing the child her text exchanges with the Father in the past, which the Father attributed to turning the child against him with regard to access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Having heard the Father’s argument, I found it curious that the Father’s reaction to any of these cancellations was not to choose to communicate with the child directly, to either persuade the child to attend, or at least to confirm the refusal on the part of the child. I note in this regard that neither the 2017 Order nor any other applicable order bars the Father from communicating directly with the child, and indeed, in interim directions I had given earlier in the committal proceedings, direct mobile communication was encouraged between the Father and child, with such communications having taken place in December 2022. The Father’s response in this regard was that the child had <em>likely</em> blocked him, citing an exchange with the Mother on 27 August 2023 where the Mother urged the Father to contact the child directly as the child had unblocked the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While I appreciate the Father’s frustration, I did not think it right to assume that the child had blocked him on the April to July incidents above. In any case, as the parent and the more mature party, it behoved him to at least try to establish communications with and check on the child’s intent. Without such attempt, the Father is unable to provide any proof, much less proof beyond the standard of reasonable doubt, that the Mother had undermined his access by alienating the son from him. I therefore gave the benefit of the doubt to the Mother and accepted her explanation that on these four occasions, she could not persuade her 13 year-old son to emerge from the house to attend access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 4 – Occasions where the Child did not attend for other reasons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     There were three further occasions where the child did not attend access for other reasons, which appear to me to essentially be misunderstandings borne out of miscommunication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the first such occasion on 19 March 2023, the Mother claimed that the child was down with fever after taking his Covid-19 booster injection. Notably, the 2017 Order had specified that there should be no cancellation of access even if the Mother had a medical certificate for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Mother’s submission in respect of this date is that there was no express cancellation of the access on that date, and the Father had simply assumed she was denying access and did not show up. Indeed, the only communication between parties pertaining to the 19 March access were as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(18 March 2023 at 8:51 pm) Tomorrow 9am I will be at the lift lobby to fetch A.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(19 March 2023 at 8:30 am) he took his booster and having fever</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Nothing further was said thereafter, and the Father did not turn up on that day. For this occasion, I accepted the Mother’s explanation that there was no expressed intent to cancel access on 19 March 2023. The Father had readily assumed that the Mother was cancelling access on medical grounds (presumedly based on previous negative experiences), and did not seek to clarify or at least turn up at the appointed time. I do not think this was warranted, especially since the 2017 Order had specifically stated that the Mother should not cancel access even if a medical certificate had been issued. Given that the Mother had only reported to him that the child had fever, I do not think the threshold of proof that the Mother had intended to cancel access was crossed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The second incident in this category occurred on 23 April 2023, when the Mother messaged the Father to inform him that she was celebrating Eid that weekend. While the 2017 Court Order gave the Mother right of access on Hari Raya public holidays, it was clarified that only a family celebration was contemplated on 23 April 2023, which was not the date of the public holiday itself, and was therefore not a reason to deny access. Again, the parties were very sparing in their communications and had only exchanged three short messages:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(22 April 2022 at 8:23 pm) I’ll be there tomorrow morning at 9am to fetch A</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">we are celebrating Eid</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tomorrow is not a public holiday nor Eid </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father did not turn up for access thereafter. Counsel for the Father argues that there was implicit cancellation of access by the Mother, since it was clearly understood by the parties that the Father would not be invited to join in the Mother’s celebrations for Eid. Again, I disagree that there was such implicit cancellation. The Mother did not expressly say she was going to cancel access. Her act of informing him of the Eid celebration may have been a precursor to negotiate for a swop of dates, which is encouraged in the spirit of co-parenting. The Father in this case should have clarified and gotten a clear response from the Mother that access was not proceeding, before simply writing off the access date as cancelled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On the third occasion, which fell on 27 May 2023, the Mother explained that access was not possible as the child had a school activity, which the Father would have been aware of through his access to the Parents’ Gateway.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"23.02%\"><col width=\"76.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(9:25 AM) If A is not out in 5 mins or no reply I am leave. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Again no show, I am leaving</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(12:40 pm) you already know he has school today and you purposely</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I didn’t know, you didn’t tell me nor did you let him come for the PTC face to face.

I nevertheless accepted that this arose out of a misunderstanding rather than an intent on the Mother’s part to deny the Father’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Taken together, the above three incidents were regrettable and would have been avoidable had there not been a colossal breakdown of communication between the Father and Mother. Such miscommunication creates the breeding ground for misunderstanding and unnecessary conflict. While I recognise that the enmity and animosity between the parents is deeply rooted in a decade of conflict, I do hope that parties realise that it is ultimately pragmatic to be polite, precise and clear in their communication, rather than resort to litigation to resolve their differences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issue 5 – Occasion where Father attended even though Mother had moved</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father had in the course of trial taken the position that the Mother was in breach of court orders for shifting from her place of residence from Canberra (in Sembawang) to Khatib (in Yishun). This was alleged by the Father to be a breach of the terms of joint custody. However, as this application concerned a lifting of the suspension of committal in relation to the breach of <em>access</em> orders, I did not consider the allegation to fall within the scope of the present application. Even if it did, I would venture to observe that as the Mother had care and control of the child, it was within her prerogative to relocate the child to another address locally, as long as this did not unreasonably fetter access in any way. I did not think the Mother’s change of address to constitute an issue of custody, unless the shift necessitated a change of school or had some other major impact on the child’s life. This was clearly not the case as the locations were fairly proximate to each other. Accordingly, I did not see the issue of the Mother’s move <em>per se</em> as constituting a breach of any access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The question then turns to whether the Father was informed in advance of the move, and if so, whether he was still entitled to insist on the exchange taking place at the lift lobby of the child’s former residence. The facts show that the Mother had shifted her residence on 25 August 2023 (Friday). She informed the Father of this on 26 August 2023 (Saturday) and asked him to meet the child at Khatib MRT for his access on 27 August 2023 (Sunday)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. However, the Father did not turn up at Khatib MRT at 9 am that day. Instead, he went to their original residence on 27 August 2023, expecting access to take place at that location.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I did not find this to be reasonable behaviour on the part of the Father. The spirit of the order stipulating an exchange at the lift lobby was intended to avoid earlier disputes on handover at the gate and at the ground floor of the block. While the Father need not have agreed to have the handover take place at Khatib MRT, the nearest approximation to satisfy the court order would have been the lift lobby of the new Yishun residence. Certainly, it would have made no sense to insist on a handover at the now defunct Canberra address. Accordingly, I found that the Mother had good reason not to hand over the child at the Canberra address, and her failure to do so at that location on 27 August 2023 should not be considered a breach of the access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For the reasons cited above, I did not make a finding of breach of access orders on any of the 25 occasions proceeded with by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I would observe though that had circumstances been different and some of the occasions amounted to breaches, I would still not have granted the draconian remedy of reversing care and control as requested by the Father. This would have been impracticable given that the Father has not cared for the child since 2020, and the state of the relationship was such that they could not even sustain a productive discussion on the final day of hearing with the assistance of a court family specialist. Ultimately, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration before the court, and it makes no sense to uproot the child from a familiar and supportive environment simply to punish the Mother for certain breaches.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In any case, this consideration is hypothetical, as I had observed a significant change in the Mother’s behaviour following the passage of the Committal Order. Having read her affidavit and heard her at trial, I was satisfied that she earnestly intended to produce the child for access and find a sustainable solution that would rid her of the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over her head for over a decade. Her protestations that she was unable to do so due to the child’s independent refusal to engage the Father were corroborated by the impression I had received during the Judge and Child session on 2 December 2022. Put simply, the child, then aged 12, had a mind of his own and was adamant in his views about his Father. I was satisfied over the material period in this Application that the Mother had tried her level best, at least more so than the Father, to resolve the impasse over access. Indeed, the Mother’s measured exchange of messages with the Father on 26 August 2023 from 8:43 am, urging the Father to communicate patiently with the child, are testament to her willingness to allow the Father to rebuild his relationship with the child and facilitate access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"24.56%\"><col width=\"75.44%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(Shows screenshot of conversation between the child and her, which states:</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother: I told him that he will msg you ok</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Child: but</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Child: I think I blocked him</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother: ok unblock him)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">make sure you establish a respectful polite conversation. he has unblocked you. start slow, not aggressive. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Father</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I have no interest I (sic)</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Your rubbish, he doesn’t come with me means no access.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I didn’t come to talk to my son, I came to fetch him</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mother</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">you need to start slow. why don’t we go for lunch together so he feels safe?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">you went to his school.

As earlier indicated in my brief grounds following the committal hearing, judicial commands alone cannot heal a broken bond between a parent and child. It takes patience and forbearance on the part of the parent seeking reconciliation to do so. This view finds support in a recent judgment of the High Court in <em>WOZ v WOY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 11</a>. Like the present case, that decision involved a father’s appeal against child orders which specified that access should take place at the ground floor lift lobby of the mother’s residence. The father in that case was unhappy that his 12-year old child would only stay with him for several minutes during the access, or was otherwise not responsive to him, choosing to do her homework quietly. Choo Han Teck J made the following observation that judicial commands alone would not rebuild the parent-child relationship, at [4]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The husband appealed because he desired a better outcome during his limited access time with the child. But the child is turning 12 this year, and she is thus at a sufficiently mature age to evaluate how a parent-child relationship should develop in their case. Relationship building requires time, effort, and patience from both sides. Above all, it is unique in each relationship. It is not amenable to judicial commands, and the courts must leave it to the parents to develop their own bond with their children, each in his or her own way. Sometimes, the court might offer a nudge here and there, but in the end, it must be left to the parent to find the formula.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Father understandably feels frustrated, hurt and humiliated by the rejection meted out by his son. Whilst compulsion is not necessarily the answer, I note that there is a fair sense of exhaustion with the therapeutic process as both parents and the child have undergone counselling and other supervised programmes under the then-Divorce Support Specialist Agencies, which have not succeeded in bridging the divide. However, I did think it would be useful for parties to attend before a specialist in reunification therapy under the Family Justice Courts’ Panel of Therapeutic Specialists scheme. Where other attempts had failed, a specialist with deep expertise in intractable cases of alienation may have a fighting chance of helping the father and child rebuild their relationship. The Mother gave her consent at the hearing to the child participating in this process, and the Father indicated his consent through counsel on 29 May 2024. It is my hope that parties make a bona fide and concerted attempt to achieve breakthrough in these sessions, and with patience, forbearance and forgiveness, finally normalise and restore relations between father and child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As I did not find the Mother to be in breach of the Committal Order or 2017 Order, the Father’s Application is dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Counsel for the Mother requested for costs of $6,000 (all-in), which included $1,000 for two oral applications made at the beginning of trial for which the Mother had prevailed. Counsel for the Father asks for no costs to be ordered, and noted that costs to the Father for an application for sub-service filed by the Father had been reserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I agreed with Counsel for the Mother that the cost for the Application alone should be $5,000, but I declined to award costs for the two oral applications, as no documents had been filed. I also considered that $1,000 in costs should be awarded to the Father for the application for sub-service. On a global basis, I therefore directed that costs of $4,000 (all-in) should be paid by the Father to the Mother.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence, Day 3 (19 March 2024), Page 44 at Lines 16 to 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See F1, at pages 18, 28, 37 and 38.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence, Day 2 (6 March 2024), Page 4, Line 5 to Page 6, Line 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>M1, at pages 24 to 36.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>F1, at page 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>M1, page 60.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>F1, at page 46.

There are now two adult children of the marriage namely, <b>B</b> (f) DOB XX June 1997 aged 26 years old (the daughter) and <b>C</b> (m) DOB XX September 2001 aged 22 years old (the son) at the time of the Ancillary Matters hearings but under 21 years of age at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It was submitted at the first Ancillary Matters hearing on 10 March 2023 that as the daughter was an adult, no orders were required to be made for her. However, it was also submitted at the same Ancillary Matters hearing, that the son still required maintenance as he had not yet completed his first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The marriage lasted about 25 years before the Father filed Writ of Divorce on 14 June 2021. Interim Judgement (IJ) was granted on an uncontested basis on 30 November 2021 based on the fact that the Father had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1 filed on 2 November 2021) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Parties to the marriage had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ and the Mother consented to a judgement being granted. The Ancillary Matters were adjourned to Chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       According to the Statement of Claim (SOC), there were 8 Ancillary Matters (AMs) to be decided by me. However, at the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, I noted that the IJ also contained two By Consent provisions regarding joint custody with care and control to the Mother and the Father’s liberal access, including overnight access, to the son as the son was still under 21 years old at the time the IJ was granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Therefore, at the AMs hearings, Counsel addressed me on the remaining 6 AMs, which included maintenance for the son in Prayer 7(g) of the SOC under ‘Maintenance for the child of the marriage’. The 6 AMs were dealt with on three hearing dates by Zoom and I delivered my decision to Counsel by Registrar’s Notice (RN) on 27 October 2023 (the AMs Court Order) which included two (not three) ‘By Consent’ provisions on the son’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father then filed a Notice of Appeal (NOA) on 7 November 2023 against the whole of the AMs Court Order save for the Order that no maintenance was payable by the Father to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Following which, the Father also filed SUM 728/2024 on 6 March 2024, primarily seeking to set aside Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order on the ‘By Consent’ provisions. This was based on the case of <b><em>TOC v TOD <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck had held at paragraph 6 of the case that the recourse to any unhappy Party regarding Consent Orders was to apply to have the Consent Order set aside.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s Appeal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The crux of the Father’s appeal against Clauses 1 to 3 of the AMs Court Order relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son. This was the Father’s application in Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father has also appealed against my decision regarding Prayer 2 of his application in SUM 728/2024 relating to other Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As the crux of the Father’s appeal relates to the maintenance to be paid by him for the son, I will deal with this issue first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1 - Prayer 1 of SUM 728/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     My orders regarding the maintenance to be paid by the Father for the son were set out in Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of my Decision dated 27 October 2023 in the AMs Court Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In Prayer 1 of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, the Father had applied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 1</u>: that the 3 consent orders made by the Learned District Judge, Christine Lee on 27 October 2023 in FC/D 2823/2021 be set aside, namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall pay for the son’s namely, C (m) DOB XX September 2001 now aged 22 years old (“C”)’s education and living expenses until C has completed his first tertiary education in Canada. Such payments are to be arranged directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    By Consent, the Plaintiff shall also pay for C's return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the university breaks, to also be worked out directly between the Plaintiff and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    In addition, if the education and living expenses for C's first tertiary education in Canada exceeds the sum of S$200,000.00 which includes the payment to-date by the Plaintiff in the sum of S$100,667.34, the Plaintiff shall bear the difference until the completion of C's first tertiary education in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     With regard to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order: At the hearing on 15 May 2024, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the thrust of the Father’s application was that there was no consent by the Father to bear the son’s education and living expenses in Canada. There was also no consent from the Father that he would pay for the return airfare between Canada and Singapore during the son’s university breaks. It was submitted that the fault lay squarely on the Father’s previous Counsel<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s Counsel referred to page 258 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was a letter dated 30 October 2023 from the Father’s previous Counsel to the Court at 2 pages. It was submitted that this was written 3 days after my decision in the AMs Court Order, to support their submission that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the instructions or consent from the Father to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I noted that the said letter contained the Father’s previous Counsel’s queries on why I had only taken into account the sum of $99,332.66 as part of the Father’s liabilities in relation to the son’s university education fees and expenses and not the sum of $200,000.00. In response to my query on where it was stated in this letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that their position was that the very conduct of writing the letter was to corroborate the fact that the Father’s previous Counsel did not have the Father’s instructions to consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 261 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for his application in SUM 728/2024, which was their letter dated 13 December 2023 to the Father’s previous Counsel, stating in paragraph 2 therein that “<em>We are instructed by our client that he had at no time consented to the 3 orders</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father’s Counsel then referred to page 263 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply in 4 pages dated 20 December 2023. In response to my similar query on where it was stated in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter that the Father did not consent to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, the Father’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s previous Counsel did not explicitly deny in this reply, that the Father did not consent to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. It was submitted that by not denying, this was equal to admitting<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and that in this letter, the Father’s previous Counsel was merely trying to justify that he had done a good job<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father’s Counsel also referred to page 268 of the same Affidavit for the Father’s reply by email dated 26 February 2024, to his previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, whereby the Father denied that he had consented to the 3 Clauses of the AMs Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Following which, I was informed that the Father’s previous Counsel then wrote to the Father’s Counsel to ask if he could communicate directly with the Father, to which they said no and there was no further communication with the Father’s previous Counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s Counsel then referred to paragraph 7 of his Written Submissions and submitted that the issue of who was going to pay for the son’s airfare was never stated in any of the Affidavits. I agreed that this issue was raised by me at the AMs hearing as shown at page 31 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit on the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) for the AMs hearings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel submitted that this issue was therefore based on the Father’s previous Counsel’s belief and not on his instructions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was also submitted that when I had raised this question, the Father’s previous Counsel did not ask to stand down the matter to seek the Father’s instructions before consenting to this, as was evident from the NE. It was further submitted that the Father was never told of the frequency of these flights, the costs and whether it would be at economy or other class. The Father’s Counsel submitted that there was no way the Father could have consented by a bare assertion that he would pay for the son’s airfare<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response to my query that it was stated in Clause 2 that the payment for such airfare was to be worked out directly between the Father and the son, the Father’s Counsel submitted that this should have been done before the AMs Court Order was made. The Father’s Counsel submitted that their point was that the Father’s previous Counsel should have checked with the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and that they would also address the separate point that the son should have applied for his own maintenance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother’s Counsel responded that for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order, he had dealt with the Father’s previous Counsel’s 30 October 2023 letter at page 5 of his Written Submissions in paragraph 10(v). The point made in that paragraph was that in the said letter, there was nothing said that the Father did not consent to these Clauses. It was noted that this letter was copied to the Father, so he was fully aware of this letter. The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father did not raise any objection to the letter, and he did not ask his previous Counsel why his previous Counsel did not tell the Court that he did not consent to these Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that in addition to this, when the Father’s previous Counsel replied on 20 December 2023, he did not explicitly deny that the Father had not consented to these Clauses. The Mother’s Counsel referred to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at pages 264/265 for the Father’s previous Counsel’s reply of 20 December 2023 and highlighted that at paragraph 9 of the said letter, it was stated therein that there was an agreement that the sum of $200,000.00 should be deducted from the Father’s bank accounts for the son’s education and living expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that nowhere in that 20 December 2023 letter, did the Father’s previous Counsel say that he had acted ultra vires<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. It was further submitted that in paragraph 11 of the same letter, the Father’s previous Counsel explained why he had agreed to Clauses 1 and 2 being made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> and that it was never stated that this was done without the Father’s consent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother’s Counsel also referred to the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 in paragraph 8f at pages 3 &amp; 4 wherein the Father had stated that in the Father’s previous Counsel’s letter dated 20 December 2023, his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses as stated in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit. However, the Mother’s Counsel pointed out that in paragraph 5 of the Father’s first Affidavit (his Supporting Affidavit), the Father did not state in that paragraph that his previous Counsel had not denied that the Father had not consented to the three Clauses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Father’s Counsel responded that my decision was issued on 27 October 2023 and that immediately, there were emails sent by the Father to his previous Counsel which had not been exhibited because of client/Solicitor privilege. Therefore, it should not be assumed that there was no communication between them until the 20 December 2023 letter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel had nothing else to add.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     With regard to Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order: At the said hearing, I sought clarification from the Father’s Counsel that the Father’s basis for his application in SUM 728/2024 was that he did not consent to Clause 3. However, I pointed out that Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order was not a ‘By Consent clause’ but a Court ordered provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I referred the Father’s Counsel to page 35 of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit for the NE of the first AMs hearing on 10 March 2023 whereby I had made it very clear that there was only two ‘By Consent’ provisions which were for Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order only. Furthermore, Clause 3 was an “In addition” and not a ‘By Consent’ clause<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also referred the Father’s Counsel to the Father’s Supporting Affidavit at page 36 for the NE of the same AMs hearing on 10 March 2023, from lines 23 to 31, whereby I had made it very clear that Clause 3 was not a ‘By Consent’ provision<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In response to my query on what was the Father’s basis for his application to set aside Clause 3, the Father’s Counsel sought confirmation that what I was saying was that the words “In addition” did not mean that it was also a ‘By Consent’ clause.

Under this Prayer, the Father had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 2:</u> Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s Counsel clarified at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that the Father’s application in Prayer 2 was for an order to be made that the son should make his own maintenance application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Father’s Counsel referred to his Written Submissions at page 13 in paragraph 26 regarding the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGCA 0020.xml')\">[2014] SGCA 20</a></em></b>, specifically to paragraph 50 of the case wherein it was stated that since the son in that case had already attained 21 years of age, that the son should have personally made an application for maintenance and that the Wife in that case was not in a position to apply for the son’s maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In response to my query regarding paragraph 4 of the Father’s Counsel’s Written Submissions where Counsel had referred to the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 at paragraph 25 wherein the Father himself proposed to set aside the sum of $200,000.00 from the matrimonial pool for the son’s education, the Father’s Counsel’s response was that no one had pointed out to the Court at the time of the AMs hearings, that the son was already above 21 years old<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. This was not the case as I have explained below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father’s Counsel also submitted that paragraph 25 of the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit only referred to where this sum should come out from<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. It was also submitted that the Father was not saying that he would not pay for the son’s maintenance but that he should not solely pay for this as it was the joint responsibility of the Parents. It was also for the son to give evidence as to what his school fees and expenses were and not the Mother. The Father’s Counsel further submitted that the son was not a Party to the divorce proceedings, so this did not change the law on who should make the proper application, supported by Affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 was for the Consent Orders in the AMs Court Order to be set aside. The Father applied in Prayer 1 to set aside Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the AMs Court Order because these were not made By Consent. It was submitted that if the Court however, was of the view that these Clauses were made By Consent, then the matter should end there. Whether the AMs Court Order was appropriate or not, this would be dealt with in another forum. For the son’s maintenance, this Order was made under s.127 of the Women’s Charter, so there was nothing wrong with the Order that was made<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father’s Counsel responded that with regard to s.127 of the Women’s Charter on child maintenance, under the Women’s Charter the child is defined as one below 21 years of age. It was submitted that although Clause 3 was not a Consent Order, the requirement that the son should apply for maintenance himself, should also be applicable to this Clause as only the son would know what his expenses were<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Reasons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     With regard to <u>Prayer 1</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024 to set aside Clauses 1 and 2 being the two ‘By Consent’ Clauses in the AMs Court Order, I was guided by the cases on Consent Orders set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The first was the case of <b><em>Lee Min Jai v Chau Cheow Koon <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0548.xml')\">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 548</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck held that when considering privately settled terms as to the ancillary matters in divorce proceedings, what the Court had to be alert to, was that one Party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. A Court would interfere with an Order of Court obtained By Consent only on just and equitable grounds. Justice Choo also held that if the previous solicitor had failed in his duty, the Petitioner’s remedy would be against that solicitor and not the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I noted that both Parties were represented by Counsel and at no time did the Father’s previous Counsel indicate that he did not have the authority to agree to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ in the AMs Court Order. In fact, the consent of both Parties was clearly signalled to me when the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ were discussed. This was confirmed at several pages in the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Both Counsel confirmed and agreed that there could be consent provisions in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 of the AMs Court Order as can be seen in the NE exhibited at pages 35 (lines 12 to 24) and page 36 (lines 13 to 21) of the Father’s Supporting Affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The next case was <b><em>AEF v AEG <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0113.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 113</a></em></b> whereby, in dealing with the issue of Consent Orders, then Judicial Commissioner Lee Khim Shin noted that the Court of Appeal in <b><em>AOO v AON <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGCA 0051.xml')\">[2011] SGCA 51</a></em></b> had cited with approval, a passage which explains that not every failure of full and frank disclosure would justify a Court setting aside an Order. It would only be in cases where the absence of full and frank disclosure had led the Court to make an Order which was substantially different from the Order which it would have made if such disclosure had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, I noted that the Father had stated in the SOC that he was prepared to pay reasonable maintenance for the son. In addition, the Father had stated in paragraph 25 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> AM Affidavit filed on 2 June 2022 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>In this regard, I want to be fair to C. For the same way as I had paid for our daughter’s education, I believe that both the Defendant and I should use matrimonial assets to support C’s tertiary education. As such, I propose that from the cash portion of the pool of matrimonial assets, we set aside a sum of S$200,000.00 for C’s education….”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In my view, the above statement was confirmed in the Father’s Reply Affidavit dated 23 April 2024 for SUM 728/2024 in paragraph 6 wherein the Father had responded that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>The [Mother’s] assertion that I agreed to S$200,000.00 is incomplete because, I agreed to the sum of S$200,000.00 to be deducted from the common pool, which means the whole S$200,000.00 can be factored in as a liability under the [Father].</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As such, I would have come to the same decision regarding the Father’s payment in the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education. This was based on my assessment that the Father had agreed to pay for the son’s education and living expenses of the son’s first tertiary education, which was in Canada where the son was already studying at the time of the AMs hearings. I had also noted that it was not disputed at the time of the AMs hearings, that the Father was the sole breadwinner of the family and that the Mother had been a homemaker from the inception of the marriage until the Father commenced the divorce proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I was also of the view that based on the principles set out in the caselaw on By Consent Orders, there were no just and equitable grounds to set aside the two ‘By Consent Clauses’. On the contrary, to do so would be unjust and inequitable to both the son as well as the Mother, as the clauses on the son’s maintenance was one of my considerations in not awarding maintenance to the Mother. This was because I had taken into account the Father’s Fact and Position Sheet filed on 24 February 2023, wherein he had stated that <em>“The [Father] is prepared to pay for the Parties’ son’s university education. However, he humbly requests that this Honourable Court take it into consideration when it determines the division of matrimonial assets and whether maintenance should be awarded to the [Mother].”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Regarding Clause 2 of the AMs Court Order on the payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore, I was of the view that since it was not disputed that the son was already studying in Canada, there should be some provision for the son’s airfare to come home. In response to my query on this issue, the Father’s previous Counsel had informed that the Father was prepared to pay for any incidental expenses incurred for the son’s university education. In my view, it was logical that this should include payment for the son’s airfare between Canada and Singapore but, to be fair to the Father, that the specifics for this should be arranged directly between the Father and the son. This can be seen in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024 for the NE of the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 31 in lines 23 to 32, page 32 in lines 1 to 32, page 33 in lines 1 to 3, page 35 in lines 6 to 31 and page 36 in lines 1 to 22.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Finally, I was of the view that the Father’s claim that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ was an afterthought. I noted that all the documents provided by the Father at the hearing of SUM 728/2024 were made after the AMs Court Order was issued on 27 October 2023. The Father did not provide any document which was dated prior to the AMs Court Order, to show that he would not or could not have consented to these two ‘By Consent Clauses’. As such, I was of the view that the Father had failed to discharge the burden of proving that he never consented to the two ‘By Consent Clauses’ and that he was simply relying on assertions that were made after the AMs Court Order was issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Regarding Clause 3 of the AMs Court Order, as I had made it very clear at the hearing on 15 May 2024 that this was not a ‘By Consent’ provision, I agree with the Father’s Counsel that Clause 3 should therefore remain the subject matter of the Father’s appeal. I would add that I had made the Orders for the Father to pay for the son’s first tertiary education and living expenses in Canada, on the basis of the Father’s own statements as referred to above, that he would pay the sum of $200,000.00 for the son’s first tertiary education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     However, I did not agree with the Father’s conditions for the payment of the $200,000.00 by him. That was why I did not frame this Clause as a ‘By Consent’ provision. I was also of the view that it was reasonable to make an Order for the Father to bear the difference beyond the agreed sum of $200,000.00 until the completion of the son’s first tertiary education in Canada. This was to ensure that having commenced his first tertiary education in Canada, the son would have the stability of knowing that he would be able to complete his studies. My assessment was that it was within the Father’s financial capacity to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     With regard to <u>Prayer 2</u> of the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024, I noted that in the case of <b><em>Thery Patric Roger v Tan Chye Tee</em></b>, the son in that case was already over 21 years at the time the Writ of Divorce was filed but in the present case, the son was still 20 years old at the time the Father filed the Writ of Divorce. I also noted that in the SOC filed by the Father, he himself had included the Prayer that he would pay reasonable maintenance for the son. I further noted that when IJ was granted in November 2021, the son was still under 21 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I was aware that the son was over 21 years old at the time of the AMs hearings. In fact, this was noted in paragraph 4 of my Brief Reasons and stated in Clause 1 itself of the AMs Court Order. At the AMs hearings, it was submitted that the Father was agreeable to pay and had continued to pay as maintenance for the son, while the son pursued his first tertiary education in Canada. This can be seen in lines 3 to 26 of the NE for the AMs hearings as exhibited at page 25 in the Father’s Supporting Affidavit filed on 6 March 2024. Hence, I was of the view that where both Parents had agreed that the son’s maintenance could be included in the AMs Court Order even though the son was already over 21 years at the time, that this was reasonable and in the best interests of the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I had decided against making an Order under Prayer 2 of SUM 728/2024 that the son should make his own maintenance application, because the law already allows the son to make his own maintenance application from the Father. Therefore, there was no necessity for me to make such an Order as this would appear to be compelling the son to make a maintenance application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I was of the view that even if the Father succeeds in setting aside the ‘By Consent Clauses’ of the AMs Court Order, it is still the son’s choice whether or not the son wishes to make a maintenance application from the Father. As such, I declined to make any Order which would appear to compel the son to make such an application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Accordingly, I delivered my Decision and Brief Reasons orally to Counsel on 15 May 2024 on the Father’s application in SUM 728/2024. I have nothing further to add to my reasons given above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See Notes of

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Defendant Husband in this case sought a stay of Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, in favour of Malaysian proceedings commenced by himself. In response, the Plaintiff Wife filed an anti-suit injunction in SUM 56/2024 to injunct the Husband’s divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I held that while Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the divorce proceedings, the threshold to injunct the Malaysian proceedings had not been crossed. I therefore dismissed both applications. The Husband now appeals against my refusal to grant his stay in SUM 3790/2023. For completeness, and due to the common context between both applications, I provide my reasons for both decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both parties are Malaysian citizens. The Husband and Wife were aged 55 years and 41 years at the time of these proceedings. The couple married in Sarawak, Malaysia in 2001, and resided together in Malaysia for the next three years. They moved to Australia in 2004 to 2008, where three children were born to the marriage, a daughter aged 19 years (“A”), and a pair of male and female twins aged 17 years (“I” and “V” respectively). After the birth of the twins, the family moved back to Malaysia in 2008, and then to Singapore within that same year for the sake of the children’s education. In April 2011, the Husband left the family in Singapore and returned to Malaysia by himself to pursue his business interests. He has been based in Malaysia ever since. The Wife is currently employed in Singapore and holds an employment pass. All three children remain Malaysian citizens, although the eldest child (A) obtained Singapore citizenship in September 2022, and the female twin (V) obtained permanent residency in Singapore in February 2021. It is not disputed that the parties’ extended family resides in Malaysia and frequent family trips are taken back home to Malaysia. However, the family as a whole and the children in particular have never resided in Malaysia for any meaningful period of time since 2008.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced these divorce proceedings on 1 August 2023. The Husband has not taken any step in these divorce proceedings since being served on 16 October 2023, save to enter appearance under protest and indicate his intention to stay the action on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. At a case conference on 16 November 2023, the Husband was directed to file his application for a stay by 7 December 2023. The Husband then commenced divorce proceedings in Malaysian on 7 December 2023, and shortly after, filed his application for a stay of the Singapore proceedings in SUM 3790/2023 on 12 December 2023. The Malaysian divorce proceedings were subsequently served on the Wife on 26 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the time of this hearing, apart from filing for an anti-suit injunction, the Wife had also applied in Malaysia to set aside the order of service out of jurisdiction obtained by the Husband. She had also sought a stay of the Malaysian proceedings on the basis that it was not a proper forum for the dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The matter came before me for hearing on 19 April 2024. As the Father had not had access to the children and the Wife had not received maintenance since proceedings commenced, I asked parties to consider an adjournment for three sessions of private mediation, which could also afford the Father access to the children over a meal on the days that each mediation session would be held. The Father in addition volunteered to pay $15,000 directly to the children for maintenance when he saw them for access. As parties were agreeable to this proposal, I gave the necessary directions and adjourned the matter for further hearing on 3 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Unfortunately, the mediation did not bear fruit, although the Father did manage to have one session of access with the children to celebrate their birthdays. I accordingly heard the remainder of parties’ submissions on 3 June 2024, and issued my decision on both applications with brief grounds by way of Registry Notice on 11 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The law relating to a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is well documented. The test laid down in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) has been affirmed in numerous local cases, including by our Court of Appeal in <em>CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> at [25] and [26]. The two-stage test is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden is on the defendant to show that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. The factors which the court will take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court concludes at this stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate, it will ordinarily refuse a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If there is some other available forum which <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of such special circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysia is the more appropriate forum </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Nationality and Habitual Residency of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Both parties were born in Malaysia and have Malaysian citizenship. Neither party is a Singapore citizen or Permanent Resident. The Husband has been domiciled in Malaysia upon his return in 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife and the children have been domiciled in Singapore for 16 years, since 2008. The eldest child (A) has Singapore citizenship<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, while the female twin (V) has permanent residency<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although all three children have not given up their Malaysian citizenship. It is undisputed that the Wife and children visit Malaysia regularly to spend time with their relatives<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, I would point out that nationality alone is not the determinative factor in the choice of forum. The focus should instead be on the domicile or habitual residence of the parties. This was highlighted by the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a>, at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>While not entirely discounting nationality as a connecting factor, nationality per se is of limited significance. In an increasingly globalised world, multiple nationalities are becoming the norm. Residency and/or domicile are better indicators of then strength of a party’s connection to a particular forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Counsel for the Husband sought to rely on <em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, a decision of the Family Division of the High Court of England, to justify a stay in favour of the preceding place of domicile of the parties (i.e. Malaysia). In the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, the husband sought a stay of proceedings in the United Kingdom in favour of New York. While both parties were not citizens of either jurisdiction, they had originally resided in New York for a significant period of time prior to the marriage, and had thereafter lived in the United Kingdom for 13 years during the marriage. In particular, the husband had resided in New York for over 20 years and ran his “enormous financial empire” primarily from that location<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Counsel for the Husband therefore sought to draw a parallel between <em>S. v S.</em> and the present case, as the English High Court in <em>S. v S.</em> had agreed to stay English proceedings in favour of New York, which was the domicile of both parties <em>prior</em> to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There was however a clear distinguishing factor in the case of <em>S. v S.</em>, as the parties had executed a pre-nuptial agreement in New York, which provided that the applicable law and forum for any financial dispute should be that of the state of New York. The primacy of this factor over that of the domicile of the parties was clear from the final comments Wilson J’s decision, at page 1215:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the end I have been persuaded that New York is clearly more appropriate than England as a forum for the proceedings for divorce and for the determination of financial issues between the parties. In reaching that conclusion I have borne very much in mind the wife’s primary residence in England; nor, however, have I forgotten her close past links with New York. I have obviously paid considerable regard to the husband’s primary residence, established over many years, in New York. <u>But the provisions of the prenuptial agreement, both the substantive financial provisions and in particular the provisions as to forum, have weighted heavily with me</u>. Even if, which I doubt, this agreement were to be of very limited significance in any substantive analysis by this court of the wife’s financial claims pursuant to section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, it in no way follows that it must be of very limited significance in the despatch of the current application. Fairness requires otherwise. I am also satisfied, for the reasons already given, that substantial justice will be done in New York. Accordingly, the balance of fairness is such that it is appropriate for the proceedings there to be disposed of before further steps are taken in the proceedings here. This conclusion yields me a discretion which I propose to exercise by granting a stay. [Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Accordingly, I did not agree that the preceding domicile or place of origin of the parties should be the determinative factor as far as the <em>Spiliada</em> test was concerned. In the present case, the focus should be on the <em>present</em> domicile of the parties and the children. Out of 22 years of marriage, the parties have only spent three years in Malaysia as a married couple (from 2001-2004). The Wife has a stronger and more substantial connection to Singapore, having resided here for 16 out of the 23 years of marriage, while the Husband has resided in Malaysia for about 16 years for the duration of the marriage (2001-2004, and 2011-present). The children have also stayed in Singapore for most of their lives. They were born in Australia, and moved to Singapore when they were 3 years and 1 year old respectively. They have been educated here, with their entire social circle found in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. They also have family and cousins in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. As earlier noted, the eldest child (A) has taken up concurrent Singapore nationality, while the female twin (V) is a permanent resident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband further takes the position that parties remain connected to Malaysia and the intention is for the entire family to eventually return to Malaysia after the children complete their education in Singapore, with a view to them taking over the family business<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. I would point out though that the Husband had in the Malaysian court papers asked for the children to stay in Singapore with the Wife after the resolution of the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, and there does not appear to be any agreement from the Wife or the children to his long-term plan to return to Malaysia. I also note that the Wife has unsuccessfully applied for permanent residency in Singapore seven times, and her sister and family are also permanent residents and reside in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. I did not think it evident at all that the Wife’s future intentions lay with Malaysia, and in any case, I would not place any significant weight on this point given its speculative nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     With regard to residency, there appears therefore to be an even split in terms of the habitual residency of the Husband and Wife in favour of Malaysia and Singapore respectively, while the residency of the children indisputably lies with Singapore. Whether this latter factor should be given determinative weight in the choice of forum depends on whether child issues will come to the fore in these proceedings. I now turn to this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Child Issues in the Divorce</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In applying the <em>Spiliada</em> test to divorce proceedings, the key question for determination by the court is which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the children (per <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [15]). This view was earlier established in <em>Re A</em> (an infant) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4206-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 60</a>, where Lai Kew Chai J held at [4] that the evaluation of the best interests of the child would require a consideration of which forum could best appreciate their cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances in their upbringing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of the guardianship of a child, and the related issues of custody, care and control, it seemed to me that we had to take into account a host of factors and determine which forum would more effectively evaluate the best interests of the child, in terms of a tribunal’s understanding of and affinity to the cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances relevant to the best way in which the child is to be brought up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     His Honour went on to hold, at [16], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of these proceedings involving the custody of a child, an important consideration must be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum serves. This is self-evident: a child’s best interest is best determined by the forum which is best equipped to determine what is best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Indeed, where custody, care and control are disputed in the divorce, a key factor on which forum is more appropriate is where the children had been raised. In <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>, the fact that the children of the marriage were raised in Singapore was a key factor rejecting the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of California (at [20], [21]). Similarly, in <em>TAR v TAS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17691-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 23</a>, the court placed significant weight on the fact that the child of the marriage had lived and been educated in Singapore for the majority of her years. The court then rejected the application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of the Nigerian courts, where the child had never resided (at [24],[25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In response, Counsel for the Husband contends that the issues in this divorce pertain mainly to financial matters, and that issues in relation to the children are not likely to be disputed. While I would like to share counsel’s optimism, I note that the Father is asking for care and control of the children in the Malaysian proceedings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife is requesting for care and control in the Singapore proceedings (the Father had not filed pleadings in the Singapore proceedings at the time of this hearing, but in his recently filed Defence and Counterclaim on 11 July 2024, he now requests for <em>joint</em> custody, care and control, which still differs from the Wife’s position). I also note that the parties have not been able to agree on access in recent months. This does not augur well for agreement on child issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In addition, the Husband had stopped paying maintenance since November 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, and it appears that the quantum of child maintenance is likely to be disputed. In this regard, it cannot be assumed that evidence in relation to the children’s welfare, education and upkeep will not be necessary. Nor can it be ruled out that therapeutic and/or forensic interventions may be needed to protect the children’s best interests. I therefore consider that the potential need to litigate on children issues points strongly towards Singapore as the more appropriate and natural forum for the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In the present case, there is also the additional consideration that two of the children have special medical needs requiring long term medical care. Specifically, the eldest child (A) is diagnosed as being autistic and also suffers from Hereditary Angioedema<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, while the male twin (I) suffers from dyslexia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As both children will continue to receive treatment and therapy in Singapore, the cost and nature of which is likely to feature in considerations relating to maintenance, this once more points towards Singapore as the more natural and appropriate forum for resolution of child-related issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Location of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The third factor the Husband submits for consideration is the fact that there are substantial assets in the matrimonial pool located in Malaysia, which would be better dealt with by the Malaysian courts. He points out that the matrimonial assets there include shares in the Husband’s Malaysian Company, as well as two properties in the state of Johor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. He is also a director of ten other companies incorporated in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, the records of which are held in Malaysia and in the Malay language, with the requisite witnesses in Malaysia. Counsel for the Husband seeks to rely on the case of <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 2 SLR(R) 0851.xml')\">[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851</a>, where it was held at [34] by the Court of Appeal that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the nationality and place of residence of the parties are relevant, they are not the only factors to be taken into account in deciding whether Singapore is the appropriate forum. The jurisdiction of the court is not based on nationality and residence of the parties alone. Great weight should also be attached to the location of the subject matters in dispute and the undesirability of a Singapore court in deciding issues involving ownership of land in Malaysia. In addition, there may be complexities involved in the enforcement of the trust in Malaysia, should we declare there to be one. In any event, the respondent would be carrying on with the proceedings in Malaysia in relation to the Malaysian lands even if we refuse to grant a stay of proceedings in Singapore and there would inevitably be some duplication of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While the existence of Malaysian assets is a factor in favour of granting a stay, it should be remembered that there are three properties in the Wife’s name in Singapore, for which the Malaysian Court would be similarly ill-equipped to make findings of fact or to enforce orders. There also exist assets in Australia, the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Papua New Guinea and Switzerland<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, for which both the Singapore and Malaysian courts are equally well placed to deal with their division. Accordingly, I did not think that either court had a special advantage as far as financial assets are concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Existence of Parallel Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Finally, the Husband submits that greater weight should be placed in favour of Malaysia under the common law doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, i.e. the fact that he has filed parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia. I note in this regard that the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGCA 50</a>, at [39] had clarified that this doctrine should be considered in light of the general principles applicable to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. In essence, the court should consider the degree to which respective proceedings had advanced, the degree of overlap of issues and parties, whether the litigation called for complex facts which require highly specialised expert evidence and the risk of conflicting judgments arising from conflicting proceedings. The Court of Appeal stressed at [40] that “the existence of parallel proceedings is never wholly dispositive of the issue of the natural forum as a matter of course, but is only a factor to be considered in the application of the <em>Spiliada</em> principles.” It was further noted by then-Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong in <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> at [57] that “the weight to be given to parallel proceedings would depend on the circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As divorce applications in Singapore and Malaysia are in their infancy, I did not think that the doctrine of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> was a significant factor in the present case. Indeed, both applications had not advanced beyond the pleadings stage at the time of this hearing. The risk of duplicitous outcomes or wasted proceedings is remote at this point, and can be avoided should sensible minds prevail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Moreover, I do note that any issue arising from the duplicity of proceedings appears to have been self-inflicted, as it was the Husband who chose to commence divorce proceedings in Malaysia nearly two months <em>after</em> the Singapore proceedings had been served on him. In <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a>, Choo J noted at [11] in regard to the husband’s appeal against an anti-suit injunction restraining him from continuing with New York proceedings, that “it does not lie in the mouth of the husband to rely on the rule against duplicitous proceedings having commenced the action in New York himself.” In this regard, the Wife further contends that there does not appear to be a justifiable rationale for the Husband to continue with the Malaysian proceedings, given that she had on 5 January 2024 provided him a written undertaking that she would consent to judgment in the Malaysian Courts on terms identical to the terms of the final judgment in the Singapore proceedings, if the Husband agreed to suspend the Malaysian proceedings until after the conclusion of the Singapore proceedings. While I will address this issue more fully in the anti-suit injunction below, it would suffice to say for the purposes of the stay application that the infancy of the foreign proceedings and the fact that they are within the control of the applicant undermine his argument that it should be the Singapore courts that should desist to avoid a duplicity of outcomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Having considered the above factors in totality, I placed greater weight on the domicile of the Wife and children, and the need to protect the best interests of the children, as reasons to conclude under the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that Singapore was the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether there are circumstances which would have required a stay to be refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As there was no finding of another more appropriate forum, it was not necessary to address the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test. However, I would observe for completeness that <em>had</em> the factors justified a stay in favour of Malaysian proceedings, there did not seem to me to be any special circumstances that would have militated against such a stay. I note that the Wife is fluent in the Malay language, is presently able to instruct Malaysian counsel, and appears to have the resources to contest divorce proceedings in Malaysia. Accordingly, had the Husband passed the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test before me, he would not have fallen short at its second stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for Anti-Suit Injunction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I also set out the reasons for my dismissal of the Wife’s anti-suit injunction in FC/SUM 56/2024. Although the Wife has not appealed against my order, the issues discussed in these part of the proceedings may provide further context to the application for the stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The legal principles relevant to an anti-suit injunction are set out in the landmark decision of the Privy Council in <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68454-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 871</a> (“Aerospatiale”) at page 892, as well as the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the court decides to grant an anti-suit injunction, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     An injunction will only be issued to restrain a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court, against whom an injunction will be an effective remedy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction depends on the presence of several elements, which were spelt out by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16883-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 19</a> (“<em>AQN</em>”) at [44], having taking reference from <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham v Trane US Inc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     whether the foreign proceedings are <em>prima facie</em> vexatious or oppressive (or otherwise unconscionable);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the defendant any injustice; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is not disputed that the Husband is amenable to the jurisdiction of this court (factor (a)), and my decision above on <em>forum non conveniens</em> finds that Singapore is the natural forum for this divorce (which resolves factor (b)). There is also no issue of any agreement between the parties on choice of jurisdiction (factor (e)). The crux of this application therefore lies with two of the above factors: the question of whether foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive (factor (c)), and whether the grant of the injunction would cause the Husband any injustice (factor (d)). I shall deal with each in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Malaysian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I turn first to the issue of vexation or oppression. In <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a>, the Court of Appeal highlighted the factors to be considered in deciding whether the threshold for vexation or oppression had been met, at [44]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether there has been vexatious conduct involves an assessment and evaluation of a number of factors. The list of factors is not closed. The <u>inherent weakness of a claim</u> sought to be pursued in the foreign proceedings when taken together with other factors may be a relevant factor in considering whether the foreign proceedings are vexatious (see <em>VKC</em> at [19]). Factual findings which have supported findings of vexation or oppression include where the foreign proceedings were instituted in <u>bad faith or for no good reason</u>, are <u>bound to fail</u>, will <u>cause extreme inconvenience</u> (see the decision of this court in <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 4 SLR(R) 0428.xml')\">[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428</a> (“<em>Kirkham</em>”) at [47]), <u>amount to an unlawful attack on the plaintiff’s legal rights</u> (see the High Court decision of <em>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 2 SLR(R) 0457.xml')\">[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457</a> at [46]–[64]), or are <u>duplicative of Singapore proceedings</u> (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [112]–[129]). In so far as this last category is concerned, however, there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em> – something additional is required to make the duplication vexatious. For example, the greater the positive and voluntary involvement of the injunction respondent in the local proceedings, and the longer the local suit has been allowed to proceed before the commencement of the parallel foreign proceedings, the stronger the case for an injunction (see <em>PT Sandipala</em> at [137] as well as Thomas Raphael, <em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<em>The Anti-Suit Injunction</em>”) at paras 19.43–19.44). [<b>Emphasis added</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the present case, there is no indication that the case is bound to fail on the merits. The parties and their children are Malaysian citizens, and the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia. He is fully within his rights to file for divorce in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The principal contention by Counsel for the Wife is that the Malaysian proceedings were instituted in bad faith, given its timing and particular circumstances. In the present case, the Husband had initially filed for judicial separation on 31 October 2023, which he withdrew and substituted with a petition for divorce on 7 December 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Wife suggests that this change of position was not <em>bona fide</em> and was undertaken simply to bolster an application to stay the Singapore proceedings, given that the Malaysian proceedings were filed on the same day as the deadline for the filing of the stay application. The Wife also argues that the Husband’s ground of adultery in the Malaysian proceedings cannot be a serious one. She points out that it was filed more than five months after he was aware of the alleged facts of adultery on 27 June 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, and is inconsistent with an offer he made on 29 June 2023, just two days after learning about the alleged adultery, to register a new company in the Wife’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to the timing of the filings, Counsel for the Wife refers to <em>Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23402-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGCA 42</a> (“<em>Lakshmi</em>”) for support. The foreign proceeding in this case was filed almost three years after the respondent had the right to proceed, and some 20 months after the Singapore proceeding had been filed (see [89]-[90]). In addition, the foreign proceeding was commenced just one day after the respondent had received news that the Singapore suit would be proceeding (at [92]). The Court of Appeal saw this as evidence of bad faith on the part of the respondent (at [93]). Counsel’s view is that the present case is synonymous with the facts of <em>Lakshmi</em>, and should likewise merit an injunction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was however not persuaded that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing were sufficient to raise a finding of bad faith. Divorce is a personal matter, and parties may choose to file for their own reasons and at the timing of their choice, sometimes long after the fact. The Wife’s own divorce application on the basis of unreasonable behaviour relies on facts that go back to the couple’s teenage years. Indeed, in this case, the Husband was served with the Wife’s divorce papers on 16 October 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, and shortly after proceeded to file for judicial separation on 31 October 2023 (i.e. still choosing to preserve the marriage). He explained that he had thereafter reached out to the Wife, but she had declined further communication and displayed no intention of engaging in discussions relating to the marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. According to the Husband, he only filed the Malaysian divorce petition on 7 December 2023 when he perceived that the Wife was determined to proceed with the divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I found this to be a reasonable account for his change in position, and did not perceive that the timing and circumstances of the Husband’s filing necessarily speaks to bad faith on his part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Counsel for the Wife also points out that there was no legitimate reason to commence duplicative divorce proceedings in Malaysia, when the Husband could simply have filed a counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings. While the Husband had explained that he had done so because the children were Malaysian citizens, Counsel for the Wife pointed out that he was already aware that the eldest child had been offered Singaporean citizenship and it was a “matter of time” she would accept<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Counsel also made reference to <em>Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21016-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 814</a> at [67], pointing out that the Court of Appeal in that case had rejected the relevance of foreign proceedings which were filed after the Singapore actions and which were no more than the converse of what the other party was seeking in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     This does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that all duplicitous proceedings deserve to be injuncted. I note that the Court of Appeal said in <em>VEW v VEV</em> (at [44]) that “there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <em>per se</em>”. Unlike in <em>Lakshmi</em>, where there were no strong connecting factors to the foreign proceedings filed in the British Virgin Islands, the Husband is domiciled in Malaysia with business interests there. It would be legitimate for him to exercise his preference to litigate in the legal system with which he is familiar. His decision to file fresh proceedings in Malaysia rather than challenge the Singapore proceedings by way of counterclaim cannot on its own be regarded as vexatious or oppressive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Finally, the Wife seeks to prove bad faith on the basis that the Malaysian proceedings are intended to cause extreme inconvenience to her. She couples this argument with the fact that the Husband had ceased paying maintenance from 1 November 2023, which she claims was intended to starve her of financial resources and prevent her from proceeding with the divorce. The Wife points to the asymmetry of resources between the parties, claiming that the Father is wealthy while she is unemployed and cash-poor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In support of this contention, Counsel for the Wife sought to rely on the following observation by Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN</em> at [27]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, I find that the foreign proceedings are vexatious and oppressive, and an anti-suit injunction should be granted to meet the ends of justice. The wife has not been receiving maintenance from the husband. Her financial resources are strained, having to deal with the numerous applications filed by her husband both locally and in New York. The husband, who is wealthy on the other hand, has the resources to litigate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I was not persuaded by this argument. It is not disputed that apart from the matrimonial home (in which she resides rent-free), the Wife has two other properties in Singapore on which she can rely for passive income. While there has been a threat of legal proceedings to prevent the Wife from doing so, it is not disputed that she can exercise rights as a legal owner of the properties. Further, it is also open to the Wife to file for interim maintenance in Singapore if she was under financial pressure. The pending application for a stay would not have prevented her from doing so. The fact that she has not done so is telling, and undermines her attempt to demonstrate that she has been financially oppressed by the multiplicity of proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In this vein, I would point out that the fact that multiple proceedings require the expense of time and money does not of itself render the situation vexatious or oppressive. This was the observation of the court in <em>VEW v VEV</em> at [101]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, the respondent’s counsel submits that there would be “time, effort and expense” incurred in the English proceedings. While that is true, this does not in itself show that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious or oppressive, or that the appellant is using the Part III proceedings to exert improper pressure on the respondent...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I would also take care to point out that the factual matrix in the present case differs quite significantly from <em>AQN v AQO</em>, where the anti-suit injunction was granted on the basis that the New York proceedings had left the wife financially strained. In that case, proceedings in both Singapore and New York had commenced for about four years before the anti-suit injunction was heard. The New York proceedings had gone through multiple hearings at the Supreme Court of New York from 2011 to 2013, the decision of which was under appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. Considerable time and expense that had thus been incurred due to a multiplicity of proceedings for four years in <em>AQN v AQO</em>. This is not the case on the present facts. Given the proximity of the jurisdictions and the parties’ resources at hand, and the fact that proceedings are in their infancy in both jurisdictions, it cannot be said that the multiplicity of proceedings would prejudice the wife’s ability to advance her case in either jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the grant of an anti-suit injunction would cause the Defendant any injustice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I turn next to the question of whether the grant of an injunction would be unjust to the Husband (factor (d)). The Husband submits that he would suffer a juridical advantage if the divorce and ancillary matters were heard in Singapore, as he would lose the chance to have all ancillary matters heard together with the divorce petition in Malaysia. He claims that the Malaysian process would be more expedited and efficient than the extended legal process in Singapore, which bifurcates the interim judgment for divorce from the hearing on ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I find it difficult to agree with this submission because there is no affidavit evidence on the steps required in Malaysian divorce proceedings, nor is there any proof that one legal system is in any way more expeditious or efficient than the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I did consider that in terms of enforcement, the Husband may face practical difficulty enforcing an order given by the Singapore court in his favour. However, I note the Wife has given an undertaking that any order made by a court in Singapore would be mirrored by consent in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Accordingly, did not find that any juridical disadvantage accrues to the Husband in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the ends of justice justify the grant of an anti-suit injunction against the Husband </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The starting point in an anti-suit injunction is quite different from that of a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In deciding whether to apply the invasive step of granting an <em>in personam</em> injunction against one party from proceeding in a foreign jurisdiction, the court must exercise great caution that the ends of justice do indeed merit such a serious imposition on the prerogative of a person to vindicate his or her legal rights in the manner and place as deemed fit. It is also a matter of comity between courts of competent jurisdiction that this draconian remedy should be exercised only when it is patently clear to all that the interest of justice requires one court to essentially deny the other of its right to exercise its jurisdiction. In the present case, while a multiplicity of proceedings is clearly undesirable, it is for the Wife to persuade the Malaysian court to grant a stay on the basis that Singapore is the more natural and appropriate forum for the resolution of divorce proceedings. I do not find the factors tipped so far in the Wife’s favour that the Husband should be injuncted from proceeding further in the Malaysian courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having considered the reasons provided above, the following directions were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s application for a stay on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in SUM 3790/2023 was dismissed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s application for an anti-suit injunction in relation to the Husband’s Malaysian proceedings in SUM 56/2024 was dismissed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As parties have each prevailed in one application and failed in the other, no order was given as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [27] and [40].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [59].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [75] and [76].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><em>S. v S.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/19633-E-M.xml')\">[1997] 1 WLR 1200</a>, at page 1204.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [68].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [101].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [47] and [49].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [70] and page 147.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at page 202-203.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, Volume 1, at page 121.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [16].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [55] and [56].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 3rd Affidavit dated 7 March 2024, at [39].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [99], at [99].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at pages 130-131.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Plaintiff Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [108].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 74.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at page 61.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dated 12 December 2023, at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Defendant’s Reply Affidavit dated 15 February 2024, at [19].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>See 1PBOD, at page 429.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s 2nd Affidavit dated 5 January 2024, at [5].</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of consent order – Custody, care and control of child – Child maintenance"],"date":"2024-08-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1182 of 2022","title":"XBA v XBB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 62","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32019-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chew Wei En (Teoh & Co) for the Plaintiff","Defendant-in-Person"],"timestamp":"2024-08-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XBA v XBB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBA <em>v</em> XBB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 62</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

He also sought that the child be returned home by 9 p.m. should either party bring the child out of the home and that “no romantic third parties (be) present during each party’s care period”. <em>I allowed the request to the extent that the child could be with his father every Wednesday after kindergarten ends to 8 p.m. on Fridays.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the maintenance for the child be reduced to $500 per month from $2 000 per month with educational expenses being paid by the ex-husband solely and directly to the kindergarten/childcare centre. <em>This was dismissed save that I had ordered the ex-wife to produce proof of kindergarten, childcare, tuition fees and medical cost before payment is made.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the ability of the ex-wife to remain at the home be until such time she remarries. <em>By the time the matter came before the court however, the ex-wife had already left the home with the child making this request for her to move out redundant.</em> She had also confirmed that she had registered her marriage with her new partner in May 2024. A child from this union was due to be delivered when parties came for the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the child attend counselling. <em>I made no order on this as there was an absence of any indication of the nature of counselling that was sought, why it was sought for the child alone and where or who was to provide this. Instead, I directed the engagement of the court’s counselling and psychological services unit to provide more information to the parties.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_f\"></a>(f)     the passport of the child be returned to the ex-husband by the ex-wife and that she is not to travel with the child without the ex-husband’ consent. <em>This was dismissed.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Against these orders, the ex-husband appeals. He also appeals on my order that each party was to bear his or her own costs for the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Varying Consent Orders</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The courts have been slow to vary consent orders. In family matters, the need for members of a family to progress beyond the grief arising from the breakdown of a family is assisted by the process of mediation which if successful, allows parties to own and therefore be empowered by the agreements that they reach. To unravel this would be to revisit the grief that they are encouraged to move from. There is also the potential for abuse if requests are made soon after mediated settlements especially if it were for the simple reason that one party feels that he no longer wants to abide by its terms. When it involves care arrangements and financial support for children, patience must be exercised, and sufficient time must be taken by the parties to allow the agreement to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (1961) provides for the ability of a parent to seek variation of a custody and/or care and control order if there was any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or a material change in circumstances. In <b><em>DDN</em></b> v <b><em>DDO</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Appellate Division stated that while a court would take a holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues relating to the welfare of a child, this should not encourage parties to pursue variation of orders at the earliest opportunity. The parents are to do their best in to successfully implement the ordered arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Similarly, an order for the maintenance of children made pursuant to s 127 of the Charter can be varied if there are material changes in circumstances or for any other good cause, the latter allowing a court a wide approach to variation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> When a paying party meets with a situation that significantly impacts his ability to pay, for example the loss of employment or a serious health concern, variation is typically allowed. Much too often however even the smallest of change in the expenses of a child sees a parent applying for variation in these courts. A child’s expenses will change, sometimes even within the month orders are made. Parents should pause and consider aspects such as the cost of living, the need to provide for ad hoc or unexpected expenses before applying for variation and understand that in certain months, not all of the maintenance is used up and in certain others, more is needed. The agreed amount should continue to be paid with such an awareness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Joint custody of the child – should there be variation?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The need to co-parent, sometimes even in the most volatile of relationships between former spouses has been extensively written on. The roots of co-parenting are respect for the needs of a child, a child who is born from the union of 2 people and who therefore deserves the involvement of each parent. Parenting does not end on the termination of a marriage. In fact, it should continue even stronger, freed from the tension and anxiety between parents caught in circumstances that they did not hope for at the inception of the marriage. Yet, continuing disagreement between parents even over the smallest of things make co-parenting appear theoretically sound but sometimes, a practical nightmare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the matter before me, the ex-husband did not seek a change to the joint custody arrangement that was agreed to but asked that he be given the sole decision-making ability when it came to the educational and medical needs of his son should the parties not be able to agree on issues arising in these areas. In cases where parties are not working well together, there is a real possibility that the interests of the child are compromised as a result. At the same time, allowing one parent to make all decisions relating to the education and health concerns of a child where parties cannot agree is often a licence given to that parent to point quickly to the slightest disagreement as basis for unilateral decision-making. I saw no need to change the order given that it was entered into only in January 2023 and parties have yet to begin to work together on these issues. There is certainly an issue with communication but in my view, the challenges were not being posed by the ex-wife alone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The child is in his second and final year of kindergarten. The ex-husband was concerned that his child was developing slower than his peers and accused the mother of not taking steps to better prepare the child for primary school, especially for Mandarin. He also alleged that she failed to attend at an organisation that was recommended to them by the child’s school for assessment to be conducted in order to ascertain if there were any needs which requires medical intervention. He wanted the child to move to another childcare centre he believed would support his child’s needs better.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife showed to the court another report from the school which presented a different and more positive picture. I could not place weight on that as it was unsigned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>The mother however had also taken the child for assessment at a local children’s hospital and the child was continuing with speech therapy at the hospital. She informed that the child was progressing well. She had also arranged for tuition classes so that he could be better prepared for primary school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> While these steps appear to be taken late in the day suggesting that she had wanted to advance her cause in these proceedings, there was no suggestion that she was negligent or that she would cease all assistance after proceedings. She spoke through an Interpreter during the hearing as she was in person. There was a genuine expression of concern for her son. What appears to be standing between parties is a different set of expectations on what a 6-year-old child should be exposed to as he prepares for primary school. She also claimed that she did not take up the suggestion to bring the child to the alternative assessment centre as she felt it would be better for the assessments at the hospital to be completed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>The local hospital is well known and regarded for its services in the development of infants and children and the ex-wife’s choice appears prudent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I intervened on one specific issue and that was in relation to the choice of primary school. Again, it is hoped that parties will agree but given that the need to register the child for primary school was coming up in July and parties were still unable to agree, I allowed the ex-wife to make that decision. The ex-wife had moved out with the child, has remarried and has permanent accommodation in Yishun. Her choice of school was one that was proximate to her new home. Given the imminent need to make a decision on the choice of school, I allowed the mother to make the decision as she was the main caregiver of the child at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Shared care and control – is further refinement necessary?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When the consent order on ancillary matters was made, the parties were living together. At the time this application was taken for variation, they were still in the same home. What then was the basis for the variation that was sought? It was the ex-husband’s position that the ex-wife restricted his time with his child and that the child was alienated from him. He pointed to the presence of the ex-wife’s new partner as instrumental in this difficulty.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>I found this hard to appreciate because the ex-wife was working and there were many times when the ex-husband was alone with his son. It was the ex-wife’s position that her former spouse never engaged with his son and that much of the interaction was with the domestic helper. She denied that access was prevented or restricted by her. They both attempted to show photographs and recordings to prove their point. I did not find any evidence of alienation. Indeed, it is difficult to make such a determination without a hearing which enables the evidence to be tested (<b><em>WQT</em></b> v <b><em>WQU</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> What is clear however is that a few supervised visitation sessions at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA) were scheduled for the ex-husband to connect with the child. It was the ex-husband’s position that it had ceased because the counsellors were of the view that the father-son relationship was good and there was no need for the sessions to continue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife claimed that it was the ex-husband who wanted to terminate the access at the DSSA as seen in the messages from the DSSA<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and that it showed how reluctant he was to participate or be truly involved in the child’s life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> If indeed as stated by the ex-husband, his interaction with his son was good at least during supervised access, any allegation that the ex-wife had successfully alienated the child is unlikely. It is more probable that the child is somewhat caught in the middle of parents who no longer get along. With the parents now living apart, creating a safe space and time for father and son will if the opportunity is taken up, be the beginning of a new and better relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As the ex-wife and child had left the home they shared with the ex-husband by the time this matter came up for hearing, I felt it prudent to define the dates and times when the father should have the child with him and provide care for him. I defined the days to be Wednesdays to Fridays (till 8 p.m.) which in my view is long enough to enable good contact and the provision of relevant care in the larger context of little to no access in the recent past and the father’s own position that as recently as September 2023 the access to his child was positive and did not require external intervention. At the same time, it was short enough to prevent a situation where the child having just moved to a new home would need to make significant changes to his routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the dates and times that I had allowed the ex-husband to use to care for his son do effectively take the form of access rather than shared care and control, I chose not to define it as such as this application is in my view rather premature and would benefit from further assessment in the year ahead. The arrangement put in place is not ideal because the child will be in primary 1 next year yet it is necessary at this time given that the ex-husband needs to be engaged with the child immediately and consistently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With formal schooling, the need for change to the orders is inevitable. An assessment taking into account where the child will be studying and living as well as the demands of school life would need to be made. I had given liberty to parties to vary this order at the appropriate time. At the time of the hearing, I was not entirely certain of important aspects which may determine the way forward for parties. There was suggestion for example that the ex-husband may remarry. A more permanent care arrangement would be contingent on aspects like the child’s residence, new family structures, the location of the child’s primary school, the school schedules, and whether he will be placed in a student care after school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was also the father’s request that if the child is brought out by the ex-wife, she would need to return him home by 9 p.m. and that no third party should be present during these outings. With the mother’s remarriage, the child’s family structure has changed even as his biological father should certainly continue with all the rights and responsibilities that come with a parent-child relationship. As for the child returning home by 9 p.m. everyday, I thought this too restrictive as there would be instances when the child may have to return a little later. There was nothing in the evidence other than the ex-husband suggesting that the ex-wife had been staying out late with her partner that warranted such an order. The circumstances of the ex-wife has materially changed as well which made such a request unnecessary. She has a new child with her husband and the need to care for the differing needs of an infant and her 6-year-old son would spell very few late nights, at least for the short to medium term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Maintenance – who should payment be made to?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Under the consent order, maintenance for the child was agreed at $ 2 000 per month. The ex-husband did not dispute the need for this amount nor his ability in providing it. He wanted to vary this amount to $500 per month and in addition, he wanted to pay for the child’s educational expenses directly to the schools/childcare centres. His position was that the ex-wife was not utilising the money for the child’s educational needs as she had failed to pay for his school fees.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The ex-wife responded that she had paid for it regularly but that her ex-husband had proceeded to pay it for the months of May and June without informing her. He then informed her that he would be shaving an amount off the monthly maintenance to reflect the payment he had made directly to the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     There was no proof that the child only required $500 per month if and when the ex-husband provided for the child’s educational expenses separately and directly to the school. What parties accepted as expenses of the child when the matter was mediated is not known. Food, clothing, medical expenses, accommodation are basic expenses which maintenance seeks to help support. The arbitrary sum of $500 was not adequately supported by documentation. He also did not share what educational expenses he was willing to provide directly for. Would it include for example, the assessments and therapy? What if more therapy is required? The husband appears to want control of what he pays for and I did not find that the ex-wife had intentionally refused to cater for their son from the maintenance given to her. Having said that, and while there was no material change in circumstances nor any good reason to vary the maintenance payment agreed to, it is important to prevent any fear of child maintenance being misused especially because it is a long-term commitment by the paying party. In some cases, it would promote understanding between parties for the receiving party to account for the expenses of the child which may change quite dramatically for young children entering different phases in their education. The ex-wife for example said that she had engaged tutors for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Additionally, she wanted to continue to have the child remain at the same childcare centre till the child enters primary 1 which the husband was not in agreement with. The ex-husband should be provided with documentation that these expenses continue to be relevant and I ordered that documentation for all school fees, childcare fees, tuition and medical expenses be notified to the ex-husband. The other expenses such as food, clothing and accommodation need not be accounted and was clearly within contemplation of the parties when the agreement for an amount of $2 000 per month was entered into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Should counselling be ordered for the child?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     One of the cornerstones of therapeutic justice is counselling and psychological services which if appropriately applied, can have a tremendous positive long-term impact on the lives of families. It is important however not to seek counselling for a 6-year-old child without any reference to the nature of the difficulty the child is experiencing and the type of programme that is being sought. The ex-husband through his counsel had not explained why only the child needed counselling and what exactly needed to be addressed. It is important to be mindful that the court cannot assume the nature of intervention. Counsel forwarding such requests should be clear on what, why and who they wish to engage for the specified purpose. There are many programmes available, and it is the obligation of counsel and his client to inform of the concerns and challenges. If it is to address access issues, these would already have been done at the DSSA which has not terminated its services. If it is to address developmental concerns, counselling would not be appropriate. In any event, the ex-wife seems to have taken steps in this regard at the local children’s hospital. I had in my orders called on the counselling and psychological services within the family court to engage the parties on appropriate channels of assistance if they required support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Who should hold the child’s passport?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The ex-husband sought that the passport of the child be given to him. He expressed fear that the ex-wife would leave Singapore with the child. Although the wife is Thai, there is no indication that she would flee to Thailand to prevent any contact with the ex-husband. She is married with her new family in Singapore. The only time she went to Thailand in the recent past was in 2023 after the challenges of the pandemic restored travel fully. She claimed that she was prevented from travelling by the ex-husband prior to this and disagreed with any suggestion of an intention to run off with her child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>I found no need to have the passport retained by the ex-husband. If she wishes to take the child abroad, she should be free to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Costs</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The ex-husband appeals against my order on costs. I had ordered that the parties were to bear his or her own costs for the matter. The ex-husband succeeded in part but was largely unsuccessful. I found his positions rooted in a sense of mistrust of the intentions of his ex-wife who has started a new life in Singapore rather than any real difficulty in engaging with his son. The issues were not complex, and the ex-husband had filed 2 affidavits for the matter. I did not believe that this was a case for an order of costs to be made against the ex-wife who appeared in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Consent orders should not be varied with ease. In this case, the matter was mediated, and the parties agreed on all issues related to their child in 2023 only for the ex-husband to seek variation so quickly in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The need for the child to bond with his father is an imperative. The child’s step-father cannot replace the biological father-son relationship. The relationships can certainly co-exist meaningfully. Equally important is the need for the parents to start to speak civilly with each other to enhance the potential for a successful parenting journey. The consent order needs time to work. I have structured the time each parent has with the child to allow for the relationship to resume if disrupted, and to grow. The reality is that the child will commence formal schooling next year and his needs will change continuously, and an assessment would be prudent next year. It is not for the parents to dictate what they each want. It is always about what the child needs. The child’s changing circumstances will inevitably dictate the response that the parents need to adopt.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[2024] SGHC(A) at paragraph 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Section 72 of the Women’s Charter.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 19 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Tab B, page 15 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraphs 14-16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 25 of the affidavit of the ex-husband dated 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24154-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 3</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Affidavit of ex-husband dated 5 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Tab A, page 13 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 38 of the ex-husband’s affidavit of 7 August 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Tab C, page 20 of the ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of ex-wife’s affidavit of 4 May 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence","Family Law – Family Violence – Self-Defence Exception","Family Law – Family Violence – Correction Exception"],"date":"2024-08-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Summons No SS 635 of 2024","title":"XBC v XBD","citation":"[2024] SGFC 63","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32020-SSP.xml","counsel":["The applicant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented"],"timestamp":"2024-08-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBC v XBD</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBC <em>v</em> XBD </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

In addition, I heard evidence from two other witnesses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A domestic helper (“Ms S”). She worked as the family’s domestic helper. The Father had called her as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother called her aunt (“Ms G”) as a witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Upon conclusion of the trial, I reserved my judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The following two requirements must be fulfilled before a court will grant a PPO:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Family violence must have been committed, or there is a likelihood that family violence will be committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As to what constitutes family violence, that is set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is clear from the manner that family violence has been defined in the Women’s Charter 1961, that there are two exceptions: <b>a)</b> force used in self-defence (the “Self-Defence Exception”) and <b>b)</b> force used by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age (the “Correction Exception”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Insofar as evidential matters are concerned, an applicant seeking a PPO need only establish the two requirements set out above (at [6]) on a balance of probabilities and not the more stringent criminal standard of proof of “beyond reasonable doubt”: <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [22]–[28]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> [2023] SLR(FC) 1 at [25] (see <em>Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/15355-SSP-M.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 308</a> at [160] citing Lord Hoffmann in <em>Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman (Consolidated Appeals)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/70538-E-M.xml')\">[2003] 1 AC 153</a> where he described the civil standard of proof as meaning “more likely than not”; see also <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> at [134] – [135] where the Court of Appeal conceptualised the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There are two ways in which a respondent to an application for a PPO can convince the court that a PPO should not be granted (see <em>TEK v TEJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a> at [13]). The first is to either show that no family violence that had been committed, or that it is not necessary for the court to grant a PPO. Alternatively, the second option available to a respondent is to invoke either the Self-Defence or the Correction Exception as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In this vein, insofar as the Self-Defence Exception is concerned, the Women’s Chater 1961 does not define what constitutes “force lawfully used in self-defence”. That being said, the court in <em>TEK v TEJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17829-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 89</a> appeared to take the view (at [14] – [15]), that s 96 of the Penal Code concerning the right of private defence was instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    “Force lawfully used in self-defence” is not defined in the Women’s Charter, <b>but as submitted by the Respondent Counsel[note: 3], section 96 of the Penal Code regarding the right of private defence, is instructive</b>. In the case of <em>Tan Chor Jin v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/59433-M.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR 306</a>, the Court of Appeal used the explanation given in Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes: A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code 1860 vol 1 (CJ Thakker &amp; M C Thakker eds) (Bharat Law House, 26th Ed, 2007), to explain private defence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…] The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonable apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose. […] The right of private defence is purely preventive and not punitive or retributive. The right of self-defence is not a right to take revenge nor is it a right of reprisal. It does not permit retaliation.” [note: 4]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    Whether it is “force lawfully used in self-defence” therefore <b>depends on whether the force that was used was proportionate to the threat made and/or harm caused</b>; and <b>whether that force was appropriately used to meet the said threat and/or harm</b> (ie. the force was not an act of retaliation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I would add that in assessing whether the force used was proportionate and whether that force was appropriately used, one must also bear in mind the fact that PPO applications taken out under the Women’s Charter 1961 involve incidents arising in the domestic context (see s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 which sets out the persons who may apply for a PPO). The close relationship between the applicant and respondent in applications for a PPO under the Women’s Charter would accordingly colour the court’s assessment of whether the force used was proportionate, and whether that force was appropriately used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As for the Correction Exception, its history and rationale was usefully set out in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [10] – [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The Correction Exception as a “Thick Grey Line”</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    The Correction Exception has its roots in the common law, which has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline to correct misbehaviour by a child. This includes some degree of physical or corporal punishment. The limit on this authority to discipline is located in the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”), which prohibits an adult from ill-treating a child (<em>TCV (On behalf of Child, A) v TCU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16808-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 3</a> (“<em>TCV</em>”) at [13] citing Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018, 3rd Ed) (“<em>Elements of Family Law</em>”) at paragraph 5.029).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    Despite growing suggestion internationally that physical punishment produces detrimental consequences in children, as the Family Court noted in <em>TCV</em> at [16], the Correction Exception remains a part of the law in Singapore. It operates as a “thick grey line” that accommodates different parenting approaches affected by culture, personality, or personal experience. Parenting behaviour that falls within this “grey” area “may not be the best parenting practices but neither does such behaviour necessarily justify state intervention”. But beyond these limits, the behaviour even if consistent with variations in culture, personality, or personal experience will be abuse or ill-treatment and attract state intervention (Debbie Ong Siew Ling, “The Quest for Optimal State Intervention in Parenting Children: Navigating within the Thick Grey Line” (2011) SJLS 61 at 80).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The boundaries of the “Thick Grey Line”</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12    Any lawful correction of a child “must be to teach discipline with a measure of good sense and must always be exercised for the benefit of the child.” If it had been prompted by a need of the parent to impose his power over the child rather than for the benefit of the child, the Correction Exception may not hold. The conduct would then be family violence (TCV at [13] citing Elements of Family Law at paragraph 5.030). The correction must also have been performed in a “responsible and loving” manner and have not descended into abuse that caused “unnecessary pain and suffering” (<em>TCV</em> at [14]). It must further have been “delivered in a judicious and responsible manner for the child’s benefit” (<em>TCV</em> at [70]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">13    In <em>R v Hopeley</em> [1860] EW Misc J73 (“<em>Hopeley</em>”), Cockburn CJ examined the contents of the “moderate and reasonable” physical punishment of a child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">By the law of England, a parent … may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable. If it be administered for the gratification of passion or of rage, or if it be immoderate and excessive in its nature or degree, or if it be protracted beyond the child's powers of endurance, or with an instrument unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce danger to life or limb; in all such cases the punishment is excessive, the violence is unlawful, and if evil consequences to life or limb ensue, then the person inflicting it is answerable to the law, and if death ensues it will be manslaughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    By reference to <em>Hopeley</em>, Professor Chan Wing Cheong helpfully identified several related factors that shed light on the reasonableness of the physical punishment by a parent of a child (Chan Wing Cheong, “Corporal Punishment of Children by Parents: Is it Discipline or Violence and Abuse?” <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Journal/101471.xml')\">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 545</a> (“Corporal Punishment of Children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)     <b>First, the reasons for the punishment.</b> To fall within the Correction Exception, the force must have been used for the correction of misbehaviour for the benefit of the child. Force used for the “gratification of passion or rage”, in the words of <em>Hopeley</em>, will not qualify. Such was the case in TCV, where the respondent-mother had, following her dispute with her own father, lashed out at the child. That force was used other than for the correction of misbehaviour. It was therefore family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>Second, the nature of the punishment.</b> As Professor Chan suggests, types of force like punching may be unacceptable per se, presumably because they are beyond what any reasonable person would consider to be suitable correction. Other types of force like caning fall to be assessed against the other circumstances of the case. The decision in <em>BHR v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18370-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 2</a>, which involved the punching and caning of a child, is instructive. The Juvenile Court distinguished the punching from the caning, and found that the punching was, without more, “beyond the act of disciplining”. But it assessed the caning based on the “number and extent” of the bruises caused. Similarly, in <em>BJJ v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18371-SSP.xml')\">[2013] SGJC 3</a>, the Juvenile Court held that the acts of kicking the head and body, hitting the head with a bunch of keys, and hitting the face and causing a nosebleed automatically went “beyond reasonable disciplining”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)     <b>Third, the age and personal characteristics of the child.</b> These factors take on especial significance in <b>the case of young children, given their limited maturity and ability to endure physical punishment</b>. As Professor Chan observes in Corporal Punishment of Children, <b>for any correction to benefit a child, it must be “commensurate with the age and extent of understanding of the child”</b> (citing <em>Public Prosecutor v AFR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0833.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 833</a> at [33]).A harsh regime especially inappropriate for young children, “who should be treated with more love and tender care” (citing <em>Public Prosecutor v AQF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0075.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 75</a> at [29]) and whose correction, in the words of <em>Hopeley</em>, should not be “protracted beyond the child’s power of endurance”. These statements accord with the observations in TCV at [14] that any punishment must not cause “unnecessary pain and suffering” to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In summary, the inclusion of the Correction Exception reflects parliamentary intent to give parents a wide degree of discretion when it comes to disciplining their children. That parliament had intended to do so was recently emphasised during the Second Reading of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment Bill) (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (3 Sept 2019) vol 94) (“Second Reading”). During the Second Reading, Member of Parliament (“MP”) Mr Christopher de Souza had asked:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…With regard to the amended section 4(2) which sets out specific examples of emotional or psychological abuse, I do have a few clarifications for the Minister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Paragraph (a) mentions well-being and a sense of self-worth. How will this provision operate?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Paragraph (b) mentions that threatening to physically hurt the child or young person is child abuse. Will the Minister clarify how this provision is to be understood in the context of section 64 of the Women's Charter where correction is an exception to &quot;family violence&quot;?...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Mr Desmond Lee, the Minister for Social and Family Development had this to say in response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">First, I note that several Members of Parliament were concerned that the power to protect abused or neglected children could overly interfere with how parents legitimately discipline and raise their children. Mr Christopher de Souza touched on the definition of &quot;emotional harm&quot;. While the concepts of emotional harm, emotional abuse or psychological abuse may seem broad or subjective, what we have sought to do in the Bill is to give as much clarity as we can on what constitutes such harm or abuse, by providing some specific circumstances and then, examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For example, Mr de Souza asked what infantilisation is, in one of the examples. This occurs when a parent or guardian deliberately treats a child as being much younger than a child's actual age and in a way that is not developmentally appropriate for the child. For example, say, a child in upper Primary school being made to wear diapers every day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">He also asked about the example of being confined in a small space. By that, we refer to a space that is not conducive for the child's development and is beyond socially-accepted boundaries for punishment. For example, locking a child in a cage, the toilet, the store room as a form of punishment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I wish to assure Members that <b>we do not intend to diminish parental authority. We do not intend to unduly intervene with parents' rights to discipline their children. And we do not intend to overly intrude into the private lives of families. The vast majority of parents are responsible and do their best to care for and raise their children. Within the private lives of families, within the bounds of parental authority, there is a wide berth or space for parents to nurture, raise and discipline their children. The common adage goes: &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child.&quot;</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">But unfortunately, a small number struggle to parent responsibly, for whatever reason. <b>And when parenting or so called discipline crosses the line and becomes excessively harsh or abusive, whether physically or emotionally, we may have to intervene to protect the children.</b> I gave a couple of examples yesterday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     That being said, it also bears noting that the law does not intervene through the issuance of a PPO in <em>every</em> instance of parenting that exceeds the Correction Exception. Even if the parenting behaviour complained of discloses family violence, pursuant to s 65 of the Charter, a PPO will not be granted unless it is necessary for the protection of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father should be granted a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having set out the law, I turn now to deal with the Father’s application for a PPO. As mentioned (above at [2]), the basis for his application is founded on the incident where the Mother had, in the midst of their argument, gone to the kitchen, taken a 15 cm long vegetable knife and threatened to stab him with it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At trial, the Father testified that while he could not recall the exact date this incident took place, he remembered that on the day of that incident, he was going out to drink with some friends. He had gotten into a huge argument with the Mother. He admitted to beating her, but also stated that she had retaliated. In the midst of their fight, the Mother ran to the kitchen, grabbed a vegetable knife that was about 15 cm long and said “you want to see me stab you now?”. He retorted: “go ahead and stab me”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Subsequently, the police were called. They confiscated the knife and spoke to the couple. The Father explained that, for the sake of his two young sons, he did not want to escalate things by pursuing the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother was able to, in her testimony, recount the incident in more detail than the Father had. She explained that the incident had taken place on 10 December 2023. The night before, on 9 December, she had attended, together with the Father, a party to celebrate her friend’s brother getting married.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the morning of 10 December, the Mother recounted that she had woken up at about 9 am in the morning. After checking in on the children, she went to buy some meat as they were supposed to do some prayers for her late mother-in-law. She returned home with the groceries as well as lunch. The helper took the food to feed the children and she settled down to have her lunch. The Mother recounts that the Father had woken up at about 12.50 pm. He asked her where she had gone. She told him that she had gone out to buy groceries. The Father asked her again where she had gone. He knew that doing so would annoy her as she did not like being asked the same question repeatedly. The spark that ignited the entire fight came when the Mother raised her voice and gave the same answer to the Father’s repeated questioning as to where she had gone. This, according to the Mother, triggered him: he began to hurl vulgarities and attacked her by punching her face and slapping her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother had, by this time, lost her appetite. She went to the sofa. The Father did not relent. He continued to hurl vulgarities at her and began to beat her up. The Mother told the helper to bring the two young sons into the room to prevent them from being affected by witnessing the violence being inflicted on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Unable to put up with the Father’s continued physical assault, the Mother stood up, went to the kitchen, and took a kitchen knife. She says that this was done purely with the intention of defending herself. The Mother explained that the Father would not listen to her and that threatening him with a knife was the only way to stop him from continuing to hit her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Upon being threatened with the knife, the Father backed off – this gave the Mother the opportunity to escape to the room where her children were taking shelter. Unfortunately, it appears that the Father’s temper did not abate because, according to the Mother, he followed her into the room and continued the argument. She ran out of the room to the kitchen again – the Father followed her and continued to physically assault her by pulling her hair and punching her. Both children witnessed this – they were screaming and crying as they watched their parents fighting. The Mother eventually ended up calling the police who arrived a short while later and took statements from her as well as the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     While the police were taking the Mother’s statement, her aunt arrived. As it turned out, the helper had called the Mother’s aunt to tell her that there was a big incident happening and that she should come quickly. The aunt scolded the Father for what he had done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother candidly stated that she had admitted to the police that she had taken the knife, but that she had done so because there was no other way for her to stop the violence. The Mother also explained that the police had, in the wake of that incident, advised the both of them to stay apart for the time being. The Father left the house in the afternoon and only returned at about 11.30pm at night. After that incident, the Mother did not speak to the Father for about a month until the Father, sometime on the 28<sup>th</sup> or 29<sup>th</sup> of December, tried to make amends, explaining that he wished to resolve matters before the new year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It was clear to me, from the evidence that both the Father and the Mother had given, that there was indeed a fight that had taken place, and that in the course of that fight, the Mother had taken a vegetable knife and threatened to stab the Father. Indeed, the Mother does not deny that she had done so, but, as she had explained, that was the only way to stop the Father from continuing to violently assault her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     This act of threatening to stab the Father with the vegetable knife does, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 – specifically, that it constitutes an act which wilfully or knowingly places, or attempts to place, a family member in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     That said, I also find that the Mother is entitled to invoke the Self-Defence Exception in this case. She had testified that she would get into fights with the Father, and that in those fights, the Father would “turn into a beast”. The Mother’s evidence was that she would walk away from those fights with multiple injuries and that it took her a few weeks to recover from such cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I do not doubt that the Father had indeed beaten the Mother, not only on the incident on 10 December 2023, but also on other occasions. The Father had admitted to this. For instance, he said that on the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2024, the both of them had gotten into an argument and that he had also beaten her on that occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The picture that emerged from the testimony I heard was that whenever there was a fight between the couple (which appears to have taken place with startling frequency), it was the Mother who would walk away thoroughly battered and bruised. From what I could tell, she endured these beatings – indeed, as she testified, she was shocked when her aunt turned up on the scene on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December. Her reaction is telling. It suggested that while she did tell her aunt about the physical abuse she suffered, she had attempted to conceal the true extent of the physical abuse she had suffered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given this, and taking into account the violence and brutality of the fight that took place on 10 December, one can understand why the Mother had acted in the way she did. As I have mentioned above, the proportionality of the force used as well as its suitability must be assessed bearing in mind that these incidents took place in the domestic context. In such situations, where the frequency and intensity of the violence has reached its apex, the victim who has been trapped in repeated cycles of abuse may simply have no choice but to respond in kind. The threat which the Mother levelled at the Father during the fight was therefore, in my judgment, proportionate and suitable when weighed against the violence she faced. I accept her explanation that all she wanted to do was to disengage from the fight and that this was the only way she could do so given that the Father, in the heat of his anger, would not respond to reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Father’s application for a PPO for himself is therefore dismissed. I am satisfied that the Mother is entitled to rely on the Self-Defence exception – this means that there was no family violence on her part. In any event, given that both the Father and Mother are now living apart, it would not have been necessary to grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether [A] and [B] should be granted a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I turn now to consider whether the two young sons, [A] and [B] should be granted a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The gist of the Father’s complaint was that the Mother would discipline both the sons by hitting and threatening them. He recounted the following incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The first incident allegedly took place on 18 February 2024 – the Father says that the Mother had beaten the youngest son, [A], so hard that he could make out hand marks on his face and chest. According to the Father, he had only discovered this when the Mother had left the house and the helper had shown him pictures of the hand marks on [A]’s face and chest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The second incident, according to the Father, took place on 19 March 2024. The Mother had slapped the eldest son because he did not want to go to school and was crying. The helper, Ms S, witnessed this incident. In her testimony, Ms S said that the Mother was walking from the bus stop to drop both the sons off at school. [B] was holding on to the Mother’s hand and crying. Because [B] was crying, the Mother slapped him on the cheek. [B] continued to sob and the Mother tried to console him. The Mother left the two children with Ms S and left for work. Ms S said there was a playground near the bus stop – she brought both the boys there and fed them food before sending them off to school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Mother had a different account of this incident. She claims that she did not hit [B]. According to the Mother, [B] was crying because he did not want to go to school. She also said that it was not true that she had left both children with Ms S and went off to work. The Mother’s version was that she brought both children to the playground where the Ms S had fed them. Thereafter, Ms S had brought [A] to his school, while the Mother brought [B] to his school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The third incident occurred on 23 April 2024. The Father explained that the Mother had, ever since she moved out, denied him access to his two sons. He finally managed to persuade her to let him spend some time with them on 23 April 2024, on the account that it was his eldest son’s birthday. She agreed to let him spend an hour with them, and brought both the boys over to his flat at 3pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father was delighted that he could finally spend some time with his two sons. He brought out the cake and birthday present. It was at this time that the helper noticed that there was a mark on [A]’s cheek. He asked [B] if the Mother had beaten [A]. [B] did not respond. The Father took [B] to the kitchen and recorded a video where he asked [B] if the Mother had hit him – in the video, [B] said that she had. The Father explained that because of the limited time he had with both of his sons, he decided against bringing [A] to the hospital for a checkup – instead, he went to make a police report after he had returned [A] and [B] to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In relation to this incident on 23 April 2024, the helper, Ms S, had given evidence that she had seen the marks on [A]’s face and that she knew that it had been inflicted by the Mother because she had seen the Mother mete out beatings where the blows would land near the children’s eyes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In response, the Mother’s evidence was that her dog, a chihuahua, was responsible for the mark on [A]’s face. According to her, the dog had scratched [A]’s face under the eyes. The Mother also explained that while she knew that the Father would use this against her, she did not see the need to keep evidence to prove her actions to others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Apart from these incidents, the Father also produced a video dated 13 January 2024 along with a transcription of the audio. The video showed the Mother yelling at [B].

She explained that she had done so to show the Mother that the children would tremble when she was scolding them. That [B] was in fear was clearly apparent to me from reviewing this clip – [B]’s leg was trembling as he stood in front of the Mother whilst being scolded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Mother attempted to cast a different light on the clip by providing a different explanation as to why Ms S had recorded it. She said that it can clearly be heard, in the video, that Ms S was asking her to ask [A] a question. If it were true that this video had shown her abusing her two children, then there was no need for Ms S to “sit there and instigate [her] to ask [A] questions”. In addition, the Mother also explained that the video was recorded to capture [A]’s cute facial expressions – according to the Mother, [A] would pout whenever she was using a firm tone. The Mother does not deny saying that she would “break both the elder and younger’s arms” – however, as she explained, when said in Tamil, the meaning of what she had said was “not as severe”, and in any event, she had no intention of breaking their arms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The crux of the dispute, insofar as the Father’s application for a PPO for [A] and [B] was concerned, was whether the Mother could rely on the Correction Exception. In other words, was the Mother’s methods of discipline towards her two young sons overly excessive such that they crossed the boundaries set by the Correction Exception and strayed into the realm of family violence as defined in the Women’s Charter 1961?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Having considered the evidence, namely, the testimony of the witnesses at trial, the Mother cannot, in my judgment, rely on the Correction Exception. I find it more likely than not (to use the definition of proof on a balance of probabilities) that the Mother’s attempts to discipline the children, had gone too far and strayed into the realm of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     For one, the Mother was a strict disciplinarian. That much was evident from the video clip dated 13 January 2024 in which she can be seen scolding [B]. Apart from that video clip, I had also asked the Mother some questions on her parenting style. The Mother shared that she wanted to raise her sons properly – this was because she had come from a broken family and had, in her work, seen children from different walks of life. To that end, she believed in disciplining the children to ensure that they would stay on the straight and narrow. She said that she needed to be the “bad cop” otherwise the children would not take her seriously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I had also asked the Mother if she had hit her children to discipline them. The Mother candidly admitted that she did – but she explained that she would only “tap” them on the cheek, on the back, and on their legs. She explained that she did not “tap” them with much force.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I asked the Mother to explain how the children would take her seriously if it was true that she did not “tap” them with much force. I did so because this appeared to contradict the picture she had painted of herself as a strict disciplinarian. As the Mother herself had explained, she had to be a strict parent otherwise the children would not take her seriously. Yet in the same breath, she professed to only gently “tapping” them, and that she did not hit them forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In response to my question, the Mother explained that the children understood her disciplinary style. Both her sons would know when she was angry and when she would “tap” them, and that she did not need to hit them in a way that would cause marks or bruises. The Mother’s explanation, however, skirts round the issue and does not squarely address how “tapping” the children was consistent with the picture of herself as a strict disciplinarian. I find it more likely to be the case that the Mother was trying to downplay the force she had used to hit [A] and [B] with the use of the word “tap”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Second, there was evidence from both the helper, Ms S, as well as the Mother’s aunt, Ms G, that the Mother had indeed hit both her sons forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Ms S had given evidence that the Mother would slap the elder son, [B] on the cheek – as for the younger son, [A], she would beat him on the hands and legs. Whenever the Mother beat the children, Ms S would intervene and tell her not to hit the child like this, especially on the face and eyes. However, according to Ms S, her words would fall on deaf ears – the Mother would tell her to mind her own business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I note, at this juncture, that Ms S’s account about telling the Mother not to hit the children on their face or legs was corroborated by the Mother’s own evidence. I had asked the Mother if Ms S had ever spoken to her about the manner in which she had disciplined her children. The Mother said that Ms S had told her not to “tap” the children on the face or the leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In addition, Ms S also stated that she would cry whenever she saw the children being beaten. She explained that, in an effort to convince the Mother to change her ways, she would take pictures to show the Mother after she had calmed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Finally, although the Mother claimed that the Father had pressured Ms S into giving evidence, she did not ask Ms S this when afforded the opportunity to cross-examine her, nor did she put forward any evidence to show that she had indeed been pressured by the Father into doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In any event, I would add that having watched Ms S’s demeanour on the stand, I did not get the impression that she had been pressured into testifying, or that she could be pressurised to do such a thing. Ms S had given evidence that she left her first employer after working for them for 1 year and 4 months. She explained that they had ended up mistreating her and blaming her when things went wrong. The inference I draw from this was that Ms S was not someone that could be bullied – she knew how to stand up for herself, and how to walk away. In this vein, I would also add that Ms S struck me as an honest witness who cared deeply for [A] and [B] even though they were not her own flesh and blood. That was apparent, not only from her testimony, but by her reaction to the video dated 13 January 2024 (see above at [43]) being played in court: she had broken down, sobbing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Insofar as Ms G was concerned, her evidence was that she had never seen the Mother beat the children when they visited her house – she only saw the Mother “tap” them on the leg or thigh when they were running about. However, when I asked Ms G to demonstrate how hard the Mother had “tapped” the children, Ms G demonstrated the tapping action and then went on to explain that if the Mother had “done a very hard hit”, she would correct her and tell her that “this was not the way for her to hit the child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It was therefore clear to me as well, from what Ms G had said in her testimony, that the Mother did forcefully hit her children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In summary, the picture painted by the evidence, as well as the inferences which I drew, was that the Mother had gone overboard and crossed the line when it came to disciplining [A] and [B]. It is after all, undisputed that she did hit them. What was in dispute was the <em>force</em> that she had used and whether her methods of discipline were appropriate given that [A] and [B] were but mere toddlers. It goes without saying that any correction to benefit a child must be commensurate with the child’s age and understanding. In that regard, I find that the Mother had not only hit them forcefully, but in vulnerable places such as their faces – this was not, in my judgment, an appropriate form of discipline considering the tender age of [A] and [B] (see <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [14(c)] citing Chan Wing Cheong, “Corporal Punishment of Children by Parents: Is it Discipline or Violence and Abuse?” <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Journal/101471.xml')\">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 545</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To be clear, I am not saying that the Mother had, in hitting her children, acted out of malice. Simply put, what I have found is that it is more likely than not that the Mother had hit both [A] and [B] in such a manner that disentitles her from relying on the Correction Exception – and accordingly, those acts constituted family violence as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Indeed, from the Mother’s own testimony, it was clear to me that she wanted to raise her sons to be good and honest men. I believe that she does indeed have their best interests at heart. What I have said in this judgment should therefore not be taken as an indictment of the Mother as a parent. After all, parenting is only something that can be learnt through hard-won experience. Mistakes will be made. In some cases, the severity of that mistake demands that the parent be prosecuted. In other cases, the parent may be given a chance to learn and adjust their parenting style to ensure that it does not cross the lines laid down by the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It is in this spirit that I am granting a PPO in favour of [A] and [B] for a fixed term of a year (till 13 August 2025). This is to afford the Mother the time to learn better ways of parenting and disciplining [A] and [B]. It is necessary to grant a PPO because the Mother is currently staying alone with [A] and [B], and the three of them only visit Ms G’s house twice a month. Given the present living arrangement, there is nobody else present on a daily basis that may, as Ms G has done (see above at [58]), moderate or balance the Mother’s disciplinary methods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Finally, and in addition to the PPO, I am also ordering that the Mother attend counselling. This will provide her with the necessary resources and support in her journey to improve on her parenting methods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     It was not lost on me that both the Father and the Mother had an acrimonious relationship that was fuelled by resentment accumulated over their years together. During the trial, both the Father and the Mother had angrily accused each other of adultery. At times, the cross-examination became a heated and emotional exchange between the two.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Despite the state of their relationship, it was apparent to me that both the Father, as well as the Mother, did have their sons’ interests at heart. In this vein, I emphasise that they must not drag the children into their own conflict (see also the remarks made in <em>WAG v WAH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27153-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 17</a> at [95]). I understand that both the Father and Mother are contemplating divorce but the end of a marriage does not spell the end of their parenting obligations. [A] and [B] are still young and will require the love and support from both their parents. To that end, both the Father and the Mother must learn to work together and do the very best that they can for them.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Disclosure of company – documents","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 877 of 2023 (Summons No 1978 and 1979 of 2024)","title":"XBI v XBJ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 66","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32013-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ivan Cheong, Shaun Ho, Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBI v XBJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBI <em>v</em> XBJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32013-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 66</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 877 of 2023 (Summons No 1978 and 1979 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ivan Cheong, Shaun Ho, Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff; the defendant in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XBI — XBJ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Disclosure of company</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">documents</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Husband and the Wife are British citizens. They were married on 8 December 2007 in the United Kingdom. They had four children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 1 August 2019, the entire family relocated to Singapore. They have lived here since. That they have lived here for a period of three years immediately preceding the filing of the divorce provides the basis for the Family Court having jurisdiction over their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) sets out, in detail, how the Husband had behaved in such a manner such that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Specifically, it is disclosed that the Husband was not only financially irresponsible in that he racked up enormous debts, but that he had also been cruel and unkind towards the Wife. It appears, from the SOP, that the Husband’s behaviour was, in part, fuelled by the suspicion that the Wife had been having an affair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife filed for divorce on 28 February 2023. Interim judgment was granted on 18 May 2023. Parties embarked on the road towards the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is against this backdrop that the Wife took out her application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1979/2024 (“SUM 1979”) and SUM 1978/2024 (“SUM 1978”) respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       By the time the matter had come up for hearing, counsel for the Wife had whittled down the items they were seeking in discovery and interrogatories. In the end, the Wife only pursued five items in respect of discovery. The Husband, having discharged his lawyers, was unrepresented at the hearing. I heard both SUM 1978 and 1979 on 12 August 2024 and reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I shall deal with Items 1 and 2 given that they both related to the Husband’s bank account statements. These were the requests as had been framed in Items 1 and 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Item 1:</b> the Husband’s consolidated bank statements for his accounts with DBS and POSB for May 2021 to February 2023 and June 2023 to December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Item 2:</b> the Husband’s bank statements for his Wise Account – for May 2021 to December 2022, July 2023 to December 2023 and April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As counsel for the Wife, Ms Imogen Harvey (“Ms Harvey”) had argued at the hearing, the salient issue in respect of Items 1 and 2 was that the Wife required these statements to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. This was because the Husband had been financially irresponsible, and in addition, there was a dearth of documentation evidencing his income and expenses. In addition, Ms Harvey explained that the statements were also needed to ascertain whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Ms Harvey also referred to the decision in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> where the court had, at [26(d)] and [27], affirmed the principle laid down by the court in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> that it is useful for the court as well as the party seeking discovery to have a “picture of the other party’s financial circumstances just before the marriage broke down, during the break down of the marriage, and after the filing of divorce proceedings”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, the Husband disputed that he had been financially irresponsible. He said that he did not understand why there was a need for him to disclose bank statements going back to 2021. The Husband also expressed frustration that money was being spent on lawyers to litigate the divorce when that money could be better spent on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In deciding whether to order discovery, I bear in mind the twin principles of relevance and necessity – that the documents sought must be both relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matter. The point of the discovery process, after all, is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matter has all the evidence placed before them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 1 and 2. I agree with the point that Ms Harvey had made – that it is useful for the court as well as the Wife, to have an insight into the Husband’s financial situation in the months leading up to and after the filing of the divorce. This is especially since the SOP discloses that the Husband’s behaviour towards the Wife had begun to deteriorate on or around January 2022, marking the beginning of the end of the parties’ relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The bank statements sought would also provide a clearer picture as to the Husband’s financial situation, especially in the months leading up to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I turn now to Item 3. This was a request for the bank statements of a company, XL. Although the Husband had stated in his Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that XL was a partnership, this does not appear to be the case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Wife had, in her supporting affidavit for SUM 1979, disclosed a printout from a search done on the UK register of companies which showed that XL was a private limited company that had been incorporated on 12 October 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The same printout also discloses that the Husband is one of two directors of XL, and that he owns more than 25% but not more than 50% of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Following from this, it is the principles relating to the disclosure of company documents that had been laid down in the High Court decision of <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (“<em>ACW</em>”) (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194), which are applicable in the present case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">20    More directly, a helpful summary of the relevant principles relating to discovery of documents belonging to a company of which the husband was a director and shareholder can be found in <em>B v B</em> at 193–194:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The documents of a company are in the legal possession of the company. If they are or have been in the actual physical possession of a director who is a party to litigation they must be disclosed by that director, if relevant to the litigation, even though he holds them as servant or agent of the company in his capacity as an officer of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    If the director who is a party to the litigation does not have physical possession of the documents, the question of fact of whether the documents are within the power of the director arises. “Power” in this context means “the enforceable right to inspect or obtain possession or control of the document” in the personal capacity of the director. This is in contradistinction to the right to inspect vested in a director in his capacity as a director. Without the consent of the company, the director has no right to inspect the documents. Much will depend on the share structure of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    If the company is the alter ego of such a director so that he has unfettered control of the company’s affairs, he must disclose and produce all relevant documents in the possession of the company. Where the company is not the alter ego of a director, the factors to be considered are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    the extent of the shareholding of the husband;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   whether it amounts to control of the company;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   whether the minority shareholders are adverse to him;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iv)   how the board of directors is constituted; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(v)    whether there is any objection by the board to disclosure of any of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    A very wide range of issues are relevant in proceedings relating to ancillary matters. The court has to assess what the husband is shown to have, but also what could reasonably be made available to him. In many cases, audited accounts of companies of which the husband is a shareholder will be sufficient, together with full disclosure of all the husband’s personal financial records. But there are cases when the court will go behind company accounts and order discovery of company books and documents. It is not usual, however, for the court to take this course unless there is evidence before it from accountants or other experts that the published accounts of the company cannot be relied upon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Where relevant documents in the possession of a company are disclosed by a director as being in his custody or power, the court has a discretion whether or not to order production of them. In exercising the discretion, the court will have regard to all the circumstances and balance the relevance and importance of the documents and the hardship likely to be caused to the wife by non-production against any prejudice to the husband and third parties likely to be caused by production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    It has not hitherto been the practice of the court to order production of company documents to which the board of directors objects on affidavit, provided that the court is satisfied that the objection is not contrived for the purpose of frustrating the powers of the court. The court will not in the exercise of its discretion order parties to do that which they have no power to do. The court will not order production unless it is satisfied that production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the issues between the parties or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Where the wife cannot obtain documents on discovery, she may be able to apply for leave to issue a subpoena against the secretary or other officers of the company to produce relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The principles in <em>ACW</em> formed the foundation of Ms Harvey’s argument. She argued that the statements which the Wife sought were in the Husband’s control – this is because the Husband had disclosed some documents belonging to XL. As to the relevance and necessity of this documents, Ms Harvey highlighted the possibility that the Husband was using XL’s bank account as though it were his own. These documents would therefore demonstrate whether the Husband had been dissipating matrimonial assets, and were also relevant to ascertaining the true extent of the Husband’s financial means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, the Husband said that he was willing to provide XL’s certified accounts which would give the Wife a picture as to XL’s financial transactions. Those certified accounts, however, would only be available at the end of February.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3. I agree with Ms Harvey’s arguments on the relevance and necessity of these documents. I also find that these documents are either within the Husband’s physical possession or power to obtain (see <em>ACW</em> at [20(a)] and [20(b)]). After all, the Husband had disclosed a copy of XL’s unaudited financial statement for the year ended 31 October 2022 in his XL.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This suggests that he may have other company documents, including its bank statements, in his physical possession. Even if he does not, that he was able to disclose XL’s unaudited financial statement and offer to disclose its certified accounts certainly suggests that he can obtain and produce the documents that the Wife seeks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I come now to Item 4. This was a request for the Husband to produce documents evidencing the model and registration year for his vehicle. As Ms Harvey explained – the Wife needed these documents to verify the Husband’s assertion that this vehicle was worth £1500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s response was that the Wife could have easily obtained the model and registration number of his vehicle from the documents that he had already disclosed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. If the Husband claims that vehicle is worth a certain amount, he accordingly bears the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to Item 5. This was a request for the financial statements of XL for the financial year ending 2023. Ms Harvey highlighted that the Husband had no objections to producing these statements but he had also said that they were not ready. The Wife was thus seeking an order that the Husband disclose these statements once they had been prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ms Harvey also pointed out that there was no overlap between the Wife’s request in Item 5 and Item 3. This was because the financial statements were needed to value the Husband’s shares in XL, whereas the bank statements were needed to determine if the Husband was indeed using XL as his “piggy-bank”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I allow the Wife’s request in Item 5. The financial statements of XL are certainly relevant to valuing the Husband’s shares in the company. For completeness, I would note that the court’s power to order discovery also extends to documents that will come into existence at some point in the future: <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [20] citing <em>G v G (Financial Provision: Discovery)</em> [1992] 1 FLR 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       S/N 3(a) – 3(c) (see Item 1 above at [8(a)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       S/N 3(d) (see Item 2 above at [8(b)]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       S/N 3(e) (see Item 3 above at [14]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       S/N 2 (see Item 5 above at [22])</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>of the Annex to SUM 1979, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Apart from the above orders, I also direct that the Husband file his affidavit complying with the orders that I have made for discovery by 16 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As to the costs of SUM 1978 and 1979, Ms Harvey argued that the Husband should pay the Wife costs fixed at $5000. Disbursements came in at $370. She argued that a robust costs order should be made to take into account the multiple delays occasioned by the actions of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, the Husband said that there should no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The starting point is that the successful party is entitled to costs, though the court can depart from that starting position if the circumstances of the case warrant it: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> citing Rule 852 and Rule 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife had substantially succeeded in her application for discovery. She is therefore entitled to costs. I order the Husband to pay the Wife costs fixed at $2750 (all-in). This sum is to be paid by 16 September 2024. In arriving at this decision, I take into account the fact that the Wife did not ultimately proceed with her application for interrogatories, that the matter was not particularly complex, the length of the affidavits that had been filed as well as the work done by the Wife’s counsel in filing written submissions. This quantum of costs also accounts for the Husband’s dilatory conduct, specifically, that he was habitually late in meeting court deadlines despite having been represented by counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Finally, I would add that based on the facts before me, I did not think that the relationship between the parties was so acrimonious as to warrant making no order as to costs (see <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it remains for me to commend Ms Harvey for her excellent advocacy at the hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>SOP at para 2b(i).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at para 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 1979 at pp 45 – 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at Tab 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>The Notice of Intention to Act in Person, In Place of Solicitor was only filed on 18 July 2024 – this was after the final case conference where SUM 1978 and 1979 were fixed for hearing before me.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2024-08-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1791 of 2023 (Summons No 1204 of 2024)","title":"XBG v XBH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 65","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32012-SSP.xml","counsel":["Teo Eng Thye (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff","the defendant in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XBG v XBH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XBG <em>v</em> XBH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32012-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 65</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I heard parties on 7 August, and now give my decision in respect of SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background to SUM 1204</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the facts as disclosed in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). The Husband is a Singapore citizen, and the Wife is Vietnamese. They were married in Singapore and registered their marriage on 27 February 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties welcomed a son (“A”) into their family. Aside from A, the Wife also had another son (“X”) who was born out of wedlock. A and X are aged 7 and 15 respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The SOP tells us why their marriage broke down. It sets out details of how the Husband had behaved in such an unreasonable manner that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. She filed for divorce on 19 April 2023, and interim judgment was granted on 2 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Thereafter, parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. Given that the Wife had refused to disclose certain documents and did not satisfactorily answer the interrogatories posed during the voluntary disclosure process, the Husband took out SUM 1204.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I turn now to deal first with the Husband’s application for discovery. I add that I am proceeding primarily on the basis of <em>oral</em> arguments made by both the Husband as well as counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo Eng Chye (“Mr Teo”), at the hearing before me. Although Mr Teo had, on 18 July 2024, put in a set of written submissions purportedly addressing the Husband’s application in SUM 1204, those submissions appeared to have dealt solely with ancillary matters. I could find nothing in that set of written submissions dealing with the issues of discovery or interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In deciding whether to order discovery, I am guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity. In other words, the Husband must demonstrate that the documents which he is seeking discovery of are both relevant and necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>WXI v WXJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31581-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 31</a> at [6] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10]; Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In this connection, it must be noted that a liberal view is generally taken as to what is considered relevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters – this is to ensure that the judge hearing the ancillary matters has all the evidence before them to arrive at a decision: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [23] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> was a request for the Wife to provide the monthly statements for the following bank accounts in her name for the past 2 years:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS account ending -6;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     OCBC account ending -xx1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     MayBank account ending -x5; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     An account jointly held with X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband explained that these statements were relevant and necessary to shedding light on the Wife’s earning capacity, specifically, how much money she was making from the business that she was running. Apart from this, the Husband also argued that the bank statements would allow him, and the court, to determine if the Wife had been dissipating matrimonial assets – the Husband had pointed to a withdrawal of some $20,000 from one of the Wife’s accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, counsel for the Wife, Mr Teo, argued that the Wife had already disclosed all the documents that she had, and that it was impossible to retrieve documents dating that far back. In respect of the joint account with X, Mr Teo said that X was not the Husband’s adopted son. The Wife’s position appears to be that because X is not the Husband’s adopted son, he is a third party and so there is no need for the Wife to disclose the statements of that joint account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     What Mr Teo said drew a sharp response from the Husband who argued vigorously that he was indeed X’s father. The Husband explained to me that he had signed all of X’s adoption papers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1. The two-year period of disclosure which the Husband seeks also covers the months leading up to the Wife’s filing of the divorce. The law on this is clear – it is indeed useful for the court to have a view as to the financial circumstances of parties leading up to and following the filing of the divorce: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31610-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 36</a> at [34] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a> at [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I would also add that the Wife cannot side-step her disclosure obligations by simply claiming that she does not have or is unable to produce these statements. She must provide an explanation together with the relevant supporting documents (such as a letter from the bank stating that such records are no longer available): <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> at [10] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Item 2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> was the Husband’s request for the Wife to provide the following documents of her sole proprietorship (“MD”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Supporting documentation of her business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     IRAS Notice of Assessment for the year 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The basis for the Husband’s request in Item 2 is that there is a massive discrepancy between what the Wife claims that she earns, and what she can afford. According to the Husband, the Wife had declared in her Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) that MD was suffering monthly losses to the tune of $7000. Despite this, she had somehow managed to find the money to invest in property in Vietnam and to buy a car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, Mr Teo said that according to the Wife, MD was indeed making a loss. If the Husband claims that MD is making a profit, he had to provide some proof of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s AOM, she states that MD has a deficit of $7094.78, and that she draws a salary (<em>ie</em>, her take-home monthly income) from MD of $3000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In addition, the Wife also states, but provides no further details, that she has a source of income from Vietnam that is not consistent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I note that the Wife has provided nothing by way of documentation in relation to MD. That said, she has provided her IRAS statements for the Year of Assessment in 2022 and 2023. This was her assessed income:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 2022: $11,650</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In 2023: $24,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I observe, solely from what the Wife has disclosed in her AOM, that there does appear to be some discrepancies. For example, if it is true that her monthly take home salary is $3000, her assessed income for tax purposes is markedly lower. In addition to this, the Wife claims, on the one hand, that MD, which is her business, is running a deficit of approximately $7000 every month. Yet on the other, she claims that she has a monthly take-home salary of $3000. It is difficult to see how the figures add up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request and order that the Wife disclose all financial documents relating to MD including, but not limited to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Bank statements;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     MD’s business monthly income and expenses statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Supporting documentation of MD’s business financial declaration filed annually to the Registry of Companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to allow the Husband, as well as the court, to assess the Wife’s means. This will have a direct bearing on issues such as maintenance. However, I make no order in respect of the Wife’s IRAS statements given that those have already been disclosed in her AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to Item 3.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was a request for the Wife to provide all documents to prove her claimed expenses for MD.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given the extent of the disclosure I have ordered (see above at [21]), I make no order in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I turn now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Husband is seeking documents relating to the two properties that the Wife has in Vietnam. Specifically, the Wife is asked to provide documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Showing the description of the property, the property title and value;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Relating to the sale of the properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As I understood it, the Husband has two main reasons for wanting these documents. First, to determine when these properties were bought. This had a bearing on whether these properties should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets. Second, if these two properties were sold, whether the sales proceeds should be added back into the matrimonial pool. In this vein, the Husband claimed that contributed $80,000 towards acquiring the second property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Mr Teo’s response was that disclosure should not be ordered as these two properties, having been transferred to the Wife’s mother, could not be considered as matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is well established that it is for the court hearing the ancillary matters to decide what constitutes a matrimonial asset. As I had observed in an earlier decision, parties have to strictly observe their disclosure obligations and cannot tailor the extent of their disclosure in accordance with their own views on what constitutes their matrimonial assets: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [81] citing <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [17]. In any event, it cannot be seriously disputed that the documents which the Husband seeks are clearly relevant to the disposal of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 4.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I turn now to the Husband’s request in Item 5<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and 6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Both these requests relate to the Wife’s expenses on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In respect of Item 5, the Husband is asking for documentary evidence of all expenses for A for the last 6 months. During the hearing, the Husband explained that he wanted these documents because the Wife had claimed, as part of her expenses, certain sums spent on A, but had not provided any documents evidencing the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In respect of Item 6, the Husband is asking that the Wife provide the “school fee receipt or statement of payment” to prove that she had paid [X]’s school fees of $740 as she claims to have done in her AOM. The Husband explained that he had proof that he was the one who had paid [X]’s school fees, and that the Wife was simply trying to inflate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In response, Mr Teo explained that in respect of Item 5, the Wife had already disclosed the documents in her AOM. As for Item 6, the Wife’s position was that she no longer had those documents because she would dispose of them once the school term had ended.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The golden rule of litigation, that he or she who asserts must prove their case, applies equally to the hearing of ancillary matters. Any argument that the Wife has not adduced evidence to back up claims made in her AOM is best ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In that connection, the discovery process should not be used as a means of testing the veracity of the other party’s claims (see <em>WYI v WYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31642-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 39</a> at [60]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband’s request in respect of Items 5 and 6 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I come now to the Husband’s request in Item 7.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband wanted the Wife to provide documentary evidence to show that she had paid about $1000 per month for the water and electricity bills. Again, the Husband explained that the Wife had provided no evidence to back up her claims. On the contrary, he claimed to have evidence showing that she did not pay these bills.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I disallow the Husband’s request in Item 7. As I have explained above (at [33]), if the Wife claims to have borne certain expenses, she has the onus of proving the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s final request in Item 8<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> was for the Wife to provide documents relating to her business in Vietnam which she says provides her with a source of income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As I had noted above (at [18]), the Wife had not provided any documents relating to this income which she is allegedly receiving from her business in Vietnam. She had also not stated, in her AOM, the amount of money she was receiving from this business in Vietnam. I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 8. These documents are certainly relevant and necessary to ascertaining the Wife’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The twin principles of relevance and necessity also govern when the court will order interrogatories to be answered. In addition, it is also trite law that at this stage, the court is only concerned with the sufficiency of the answers that had been given, and not the <em>truth</em> of those answers (<em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [27] – [30]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The interrogatory framed in Item 1 was a request for the Wife to state her employment history for the past decade (from 2015 to 2024) with relevant details such as the employer name and monthly gross income.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In addition, if the Wife was self-employed during this time, she was also to state the nature of the business and the duration in which she was self-employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     This was the response which the Wife had given in her voluntary response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a husband, the Defendant should know better. The Defendant would be a complete failure if he is not aware of what the Plaintiff is working as.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This is an insufficient answer. The Wife had clearly not answered the interrogatory. She had given a response that was sarcastic and insulting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, Item 1 was clearly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters hearing given what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM. While the Wife had disclosed that she was a beauty technician and had owned MD, she had provided no other details as to what she was working as before she had set up MD, and what other employment she had found after MD had closed down. It would be useful for both the Husband and the court to have a fuller picture of the Wife’s employment history – this was certainly central to assessing her means, and to determine if there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets on her part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The interrogatory framed in Item 2 required the Wife to state details of her business venture in Vietnam – this included, amongst other things, the source of funds used for the business venture.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This interrogatory stems from what the Wife had disclosed in her AOM – that she had an inconsistent source of income from Vietnam.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     This was the Wife’s response:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>A</b>.     <b>Please state the nature of the Business venture in Vietnam:</b> The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam and the Plaintiff would like to claim losses as a result of being his wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>B</b>.     <b>Business start date:</b> The Plaintiff had the Vietnam business from September 2023 to October 2023. The Plaintiff had already closed down her business venture in Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>C</b>.     <b>Business Participation:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down because as his wife, there was no time to do business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>D</b>.     <b>Business Funding Amount:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down, unless the Defendant agree to pay for the Plaintiff’s losses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>E</b>.     <b>Source of funds for business venture:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply the Defendant as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>F</b>.     <b>Income statement from business:</b> The Plaintiff had no obligation to reply and/or provide the Defendant with documentary evidence as the business venture had already been closed down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     It is clear that this response is insufficient. The Wife had not provided the details sought, except to state that the Vietnam business was in operation from September to October 2023. Apart from the fact that her answer was insufficient, it is also plainly provocative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 2. The details of the Wife’s Vietnam business are indeed relevant and necessary to ascertaining her means at the hearing of the ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I come now to Item 3. This was a request for the Wife to state all the properties in which she either owned or had an interest in, and to provide details of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff did not know which properties the Defendant were talking about.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This is not, in my judgment, a sufficient answer. The interrogatory, as it is framed, is capable of either a positive or a negative answer. It is not sufficient to claim ignorance as to which properties the Husband is referring to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 3. I am satisfied that the interrogatory is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – specifically, determining which assets fell into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I come now to Item 4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The manner in which this interrogatory was framed suggested that the Husband was asking for the Wife’s monthly bank account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     During the hearing, the Husband clarified that he was actually asking the Wife to state the amounts in her bank account from February 2023 to February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff had already provided the bank statement for her 3 banks account in Singapore, for appropriate care and upbringing given to son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that I had allowed the Husband’s request for the Wife to disclose her bank statements (see [13] above), I do not think that this interrogatory is necessary. The Husband’s request in respect of Item 4 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In summary, these are the orders which I make in respect of SUM 1204:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the documents listed at paragraphs 3, 4, 6, and 10<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her possession, custody or power, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for her explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall answer the interrogatories as set out at paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of the Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by 28 August 2024. Cost submissions for SUM 1204 are to be filed by way of letter, limited to a maximum of three pages each. This should be done no later than 28 August 2024. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I must emphasise that the interrogatory process is not an opportunity for a party to hurl snide remarks. The manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories was completely unnecessary and only served to risk aggravating matters between the parties (see above at [41] and [46]). Such behaviour is unacceptable in our family justice system. To that end, parties are to, in their submissions on costs, address me on whether any costs ordered should also take into account the manner in which the Wife had chosen to answer the interrogatories that had been put to her.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 3(c) on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>As set out at para 3(c) of the Wife’s AOM on p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Discovery at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at p 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 4 on p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at pp 8 and 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit Application for Interrogatories at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>These have been referred to in this judgment as Items 1, 2, 4, and 8.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents belonging to a third party","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories – Sufficiency of answer"],"date":"2024-08-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2161 of 2023 (Summons No 1650, 1651, 1687 and 1688 of 2024)","title":"XAY v XAZ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 60","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31974-SSP.xml","counsel":["Tan Jin Song, Deborah Ng Wan Yun and Connie Kuan (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Chew Wei En (Teoh & Co LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-08-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XAY v XAZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAY <em>v</em> XAZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 60</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

As to what is “relevant”, the cases state that what is relevant in the context of family cases is very wide – this ensures the proper delineation of issues and that all the necessary evidence is placed before the judge hearing the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [23] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although there were 9 items as set out in the annex to SUM 1650, Mr Tan confirmed during the hearing that the Husband was not proceeding with his request in respect of Item 9. I turn now to deal with the rest of the items.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I shall deal with Items 1 and 2 together. Item 1 was a request for the consolidated statements for the Wife’s bank accounts for the period February 2023 to February 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS Savings Account No. ending -48; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     DBS Unit trusts Account No ending -10.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Mr Tan explained that the Wife had only provided her bank statements from January 2023 to November 2023, and that she did not provide her statements from December 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan also highlighted that on 20 October 2023, the Wife had withdrawn the sums of $50,000 and $69,000 from her account. The bank statements which the Husband sought were therefore relevant and necessary to ascertain if the Wife had made other similarly large withdrawals from her account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 2 was a request for the bank statements for the Wife’s UOB Stash account ending -0-0 for the period February 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan explained that while the Wife had disclosed her statements from June 2023 to October 2023, she did not provide her statements from November 2023 to February 2024, nor did she explain why she had not done so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Mr Chew’s response in relation to Items 1 and 2 was that it was a mere fishing expedition. There was no need for these documents to be disclosed because it was well-established law that the court ascertains the pool of matrimonial assets as of the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     While it is true that the court should generally rely on the date of the interim judgment as the starting point in determining the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>WXW v WXX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31651-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 24</a>), this is not a rule cast in stone. The court can depart from this starting point: see <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [26] (see also <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [31]; <em>TQU v TQT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24198-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 8</a> at [35] – [38]). There was, therefore, no basis to refuse disclosure on the basis that the documents were irrelevant as the pool of matrimonial assets was ascertained as at the date of interim judgment, and these statements related to a period <em>after</em> interim judgment had been granted. The judge hearing the ancillary matters is well entitled to choose an operative date, after the grant of the interim judgment, to ascertain the pool of matrimonial assets. To that end, the documents which the Husband seeks are certainly relevant and necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the circumstances, I will allow the Husband’s request in Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Item 3 was a request for documents setting out the Wife’s CPF contribution history showing the parties which had contributed to her CPF account, the amounts contributed, and the dates of these contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As Mr Tan explained, these documents were relevant and necessary to establishing whether the Wife had been employed in Singapore. This was because the Wife does not dispute, on the one hand, that she received CPF contributions. Yet, on the other, the Wife also states that she had never been employed in Singapore. The Wife’s position was that money had been deposited in her CPF account because she had allowed the Husband’s current partner to “use her name as an employee to reach certain quotas”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Although the Wife had disclosed her income tax statements and CPF statements, Mr Tan argued that this was not enough. The Husband wanted documents showing specific details relating to the amounts that had been contributed to the Wife’s CPF account – these documents went towards the issue of whether any adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife, and the extent of such an adverse inference that should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, Mr Chew argued that these documents were not necessary or relevant because the Wife had already given her income tax statements which clearly showed that she did not have to pay taxes in the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Given the extent of the Wife’s disclosure, there was, according to Mr Chew, no further need to allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife had indeed, in her reply affidavit, produced her CPF statements from 2016 – 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> However, the statements which were disclosed only provided a summary of the transactions in the entire year. For example, in 2016, the Wife’s CPF statements disclose that a total of $4236.53 had been contributed to her CPF accounts. The statement further discloses that either herself or her employer had contributed some $4070. What the statement does not show, however, is <em>who</em> had made that contribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in Item 3. In addition, I also order the Wife to disclose any payslips that she may have, or be able to obtain. If she cannot produce her payslips, she must provide an explanation along with any supporting documents. I deem it fit to make such an additional order because it appears, from her CPF statements, that she had received employer contributions to her CPF accounts – and if this is indeed the case, it is also likely that there would be a payslip providing the breakdown of her salary including the contributions to her CPF made by her employer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Item 4 was a request for statements from the Wife’s CDP, investment, and trading accounts for the period February 2023 to February 2024. Mr Tan highlighted that the documents showed that on 19 January 2023, the Wife had received a sum of approximately $68,000 from her stock-broker. Given that this had taken place in the months leading up to the grant of the interim judgment, it raised the suspicion that the Wife was dissipating assets which rightfully belonged to the matrimonial pool. These statements were therefore relevant and necessary to determining whether there was indeed any dissipation of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In response, Mr Chew argued that the Wife was not the one who had filed the divorce – it therefore could not be alleged that she was dissipating assets in anticipation of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I could not agree with Mr Chew’s argument. The cases make it clear that it is useful for the court to have a snapshot of the parties’ financial situation in the months leading up to the breakdown of their marriage and the filing of the divorce: <em>WXY v WXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31610-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 36</a> at [34] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]; <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a> at [9]. It matters very little as to which party had fired the first shot in filing for the divorce. For example, the defendant to a divorce suit may well have, in sensing that the writing was on the wall and that divorce proceedings were imminent, taken steps to put their assets out of reach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 4.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Item 5 was a request for documents showing the amounts the Wife had received from lending her name to various friends and other people to set up companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband had asked for these documents because in the Wife’s Affidavit of Asset and Means (“AOM”), she had stated:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Apart from the online work I was doing, in order to supplement our income, I would also lend my name to various friends and other people, who needed to use my name to set up companies. This includes the [Husband] and the company known as [MX] was one such instance. The [Husband] wanted to start a side business while remaining employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The documents provided by the Wife, however, painted a different picture. The Husband points to two emails disclosed by the Wife. These emails are written by two separate individuals, [“XL”] and [“HS”]. Both emails state that they had used the Wife’s name to set up their company, but they had never given her any money for this – the Wife had helped them out as they were friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife claimed that she had already provided all the documents she had – if the Husband was dissatisfied, this was a matter to be raised in submissions at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 5. I note that parties do not dispute either the relevance or necessity of these documents. Rather, their quarrel centres over whether the Wife had indeed produced all the relevant documentation. In that vein, I add that the Wife cannot sidestep her disclosure obligations by claiming, without more, that she does not have the documents. She must, minimally, furnish an explanation as to why she cannot produce the documents along with any relevant documents in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Item 6 was a request for the annual financial statements for the Wife’s businesses in China from 2016 – 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Mr Tan argued that the Wife should provide the relevant documents to substantiate her claim that she had earned about SGD 1 million and used it to purchase 2 commercial properties during the marriage as she had alleged at paragraph 16(h) of her first AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Mr Chew stated that the Wife did not have any documents and thus was unable to provide disclosure of the same. To be clear, Mr Chew did not dispute that there were no such documents in existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     During the hearing, I had asked Mr Tan why the Husband wanted these documents. After all, if the Wife had claimed that she had used her profits from her company to purchase two commercial properties, but had not provided proof of the same, that was to her detriment. Mr Tan explained that the documents were also needed to determine if there was anything else that the Wife had yet to disclose. Mr Tan also argued that without these documents, it was impossible to ascertain how much the Wife had earnt from her business in China, let alone begin to frame any submissions on any adverse inferences that should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I agree with these points made by Mr Tan. Leaving aside the general principle that the party who asserts must prove their case, I am of the view that these documents were certainly relevant to the issue of whether any adverse inference should be drawn as well as ascertaining the Wife’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 6.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I come now to Item 7. This was a request for documents showing the monthly income received by the Wife’s rental property in China including, but not limited to, the tenancy agreements as well as bank statements to show the rental income received.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     There was some dispute, at the hearing, as to whether the Husband was going beyond his original request for documents for the period February 2023 to date. Mr Tan clarified that what the Husband was simply asking for was that if the Wife took the position that she was unable to disclose these documents, she should provide an explanation including any supporting documents (<em>eg</em>, documents showing that the tenancy had ended prior to February 2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 7. The documents sought were relevant and necessary to establishing the Wife’s means – it had a direct bearing on issues such as maintenance. I note that the Wife claimed that she had already complied with the Husband’s original request as there was no rental from February 2023 onwards.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> However, as Mr Tan rightly points out, if the Wife does not have these documents, she must provide an explanation along with any relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Item 8 was a request for documents to show the current valuation of the Wife’s rental property in China. Mr Tan argued that all the Wife had provided in relation to the valuation of this property was the screenshot of a text message from a person purporting to be the agent that had helped the Wife purchase the property. The message said that the Wife would receive 270,000 yuan if the property was sold.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan argued that this was insufficient disclosure – if she had purchased the property, there must be some documents evidencing that transaction. These documents would also disclose the value of the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In response, Mr Chew argued that any dispute as to the valuation of the property was a matter for submissions and should not be tested in the discovery process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While disputes as to the valuation of the property are, as Mr Chew rightly points out, a matter best left for submissions, there must be some evidential basis for the parties to dispute the valuation of the property. Simply put, there must be certain documents showing, <em>inter alia</em>, how the value of the property was derived. This would include documents which form part of the paper trail created in property transactions: for instance, bank loans which had been taken out or an option to purchase. In this connection, I agreed with Mr Tan that there was simply insufficient disclosure on the Wife’s part in the present case. This text message alone was simply not enough.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 8. The Wife shall disclose any documents that shed light on the valuation of the China property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1651 – The Husband’s Application for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is trite law that the twin principles of relevance and necessity govern when interrogatories are ordered. One other consideration that must be taken into account is whether the answer which had been provided is sufficient, and not whether the answer which had been provided was true. The truth of any of the answers is a matter to be determined by the judge hearing the ancillary matters. These are the principles which I apply to both SUM 1651 and SUM 1688. I note, at the outset, that parties did not dispute the relevance or necessity of these interrogatories – rather, the main dispute centred on the sufficiency of the answer which had been provided by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This was the interrogatory posed in Item 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please state the source(s) of contributions to your CPF accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     This was the answer which the Wife had provided:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The contributions are made by companies who had used our client’s name as an employee. Our client received no income other than the CPF contributions that were made by these companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     This was, in my judgment, not a sufficient answer. The interrogatory posed had asked the Wife to state the source(s) of contributions to her CPF account. While the interrogatory could perhaps have been framed with more precision, for example, by asking the Wife to list all the entities that had contributed to her CPF account, it was apparent to me that this was exactly the intent of the interrogatory which had been posed. It was insufficient for the Wife to merely state, without going into detail, that she was receiving payment from certain companies which had used her name as an employee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 1 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I turn now to Item 2. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to the allegation that apart from the online work that you were doing, in order to supplement your income, you also lent your name to various friends and other people, who needed to use your name to set up companies, please state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The names of the people and the businesses that you have lent your name to, the dates of incorporation of the companies and the names and UEN of the companies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    The income that you received for each of the business(es) that you lent your name to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     One part of the answer which the Wife had provided in her response dated 25 April 2024 contained a formatting error. The Wife’s amended response to clarify that part of her answer was provided in an email from her lawyers dated 23 May 2024. For ease of analysis, the Wife’s response to Item 2 is reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The names of the friends are [XL] and [HS]. The names of the companies are [CD] and .[SLE]. The Plaintiff is aware of the UEN number and incorporation dates as the ACRA profile of these companies are already provided earlier. The Defendant does not recall the dates and the UEN numbers in any event.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    The Defendant only received about $400 (ex gratia payment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It was clear to me that the Wife’s response in respect of Item 2(a) was sufficient. She had answered every part of the interrogatory, and disclosed the names of her friends and corporate entities that she had lent her name to. That said, I make no comment as to the <em>truth</em> of the answer provided – this is a matter to be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As for the Wife’s response in respect of Item 2(b), that was, in my judgment, an insufficient answer. The interrogatory as framed in Item 2(b) had specifically asked the Wife to state the income for <em>each</em> of the businesses that she had lent her name to. The Wife had not done this. As a consequence, it is unclear whether she had received $400 from <em>each</em> of the corporate entities she had named, or whether she had received $400 in total. In that vein, I would go further to add that an unclear or ambiguous answer cannot be considered a sufficient answer to an interrogatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 2(b) is allowed. His request in Item 2(a) is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I turn now to Item 3. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With reference to your China business that was set up sometime in 2016 and involved the buying and selling of cars as well as an internet business, please state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    details of the “internet business”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if you incorporated the business(es) in China;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    your capital for the business(es) and the source for the same;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the amount you earned from the business(es) from the time it was incorporated until the time the business “folded”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    the exact date on which the business(es) “folded”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The name of the company was [ST].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Yes. The Defendant was a franchisee from a major internet business company in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    It was from the Defendant’s savings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    The Defendant does not recall the same but estimates that it was more than S$1 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)    17 September 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     While the Husband is perfectly entitled to dispute the truth of the Wife’s response, there can be, in my judgment, no dispute as to the sufficiency of the answer. It is clear that the Wife had answered each and every part of the interrogatory posed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Husband’s request in respect of Item 3 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1687 – The Wife’s Application for Discovery </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1687.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Item 1 was a request for the Husband’s CDP statements for the years 2017 – 2021. Mr Chew explained that the statements were needed to piece together the value of any shares which the Husband had in his CDP account. In response, Mr Tan said that the Husband did not have any of these statements. Mr Tan also argued that the period of disclosure sought was too wide as it covered the period prior to the breakdown of the marriage and the filing of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Insofar as the period of disclosure is concerned, given the threadbare details provided in the Statement of Particulars, it is difficult to say with any measure of certainty when the marriage had begun to break down. What has been stated, however, is that parties had begun to sleep in separate bedrooms sometime around March 2019. In light of this, I do not think that the period of disclosure sought is an unreasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 1. If the Husband is unable to produce these documents, he must provide an explanation along with any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Item 2 was a request for the Husband to produce the statements for the years 2017 – 2021 for the following bank accounts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     DBS account ending xx-7</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     DBS account ending xx-1</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>(c)     DBS account ending xx-0; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>(d)     HSBC Advance Account ending -xx2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As Mr Chew explained, the Wife was seeking discovery of these bank statements for an extended period because the Husband had stated, on the one hand, that his salary was very low, yet on the other, he was able to make payment of some $600,000 towards the mortgage. These bank statements were therefore relevant and necessary towards ascertaining the true extent of the Husband’s financial means and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Mr Tan’s response was that the Husband had already disclosed his source of funds at para 15.6 of the Husband’s first AOM:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The current value of the Matrimonial Property is S$1,660,000.00 (Annex 6) and the loan left is S$66,366.43 (Annex 5). The nett value is therefore approximately S$1,593,633.57. I also wish to say that if I depended on my salary alone, that would be insufficient for all this payment and the family’s expenses over the years. I had actually worked as much overtime as I could, and if I could not (due to limited hours) I would find odd jobs and work on the side. Due to my skills, I did manage to save up for all this expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Mr Tan also argued that insofar as the Wife might harbour suspicions that the Husband had dissipated assets which rightfully belonged to the matrimonial pool, there was simply no such evidence that could give rise or lend credence to such suspicions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I note that the Husband had produced, in his reply affidavit to SUM 1687, an email from HSBC stating that the partial redemption of $531,000 had taken place on 15<sup>th</sup> November 2016. According to the Husband, he had managed to come up with this amount, notwithstanding his low salary, from all the side income he had earnt from doing odd-jobs. There are, however, no details in his first AOM, as to how much income he had derived from these odd-jobs, and no supporting documents to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in Item 2. In addition to this, I will also order that the Husband is to disclose any bank statements that he may have, or that he may be able to obtain from January 2010 to December 2016. If the Husband is unable to produce these bank statements, he must provide an explanation, as well as documents in support (<em>eg</em>, a response from the bank stating that the account statements are no longer available due to the passage of time).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In my judgment, these documents are certainly relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. They would allow the court to determine whether the Husband had indeed made full and frank disclosure of his financial means and resources. These documents would also shed light on whether there indeed any other assets belonging to the Husband which have yet to be disclosed, and also allow the Wife to ascertain the Husband’s means from the comings and goings of his bank accounts. I have also ordered a wider period of disclosure than what the Wife had sought because, having read the Husband’s first AOM, it appeared to me that the bank statements from 2010 to 2016 were also necessary to piecing together how the Husband had managed to not only pay off a sum of almost $500,000 towards the mortgage, but also the sum of approximately $90,000 towards his life insurance premium (see below at [76]) <em>despite</em> claiming to draw a salary of $2000 – $3000 and doing some odd jobs on the side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Item 3 was a request for the Husband to show cash payments that he had made towards the matrimonial home including, but not limited to, the HSBC mortgage loan. Given that I have allowed the Wife’s request in respect of Item 2, I make no order in relation to Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Item 4 was a request for documents to show how much the Husband had earnt including the odd jobs and work that he had done on the side. It is clear why the Wife had made this request – the Husband had declared that he paid down the mortgage with his earnings from his side income. The Wife thus wanted documents to ascertain the true extent of the Husband’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Mr Tan argued that the Wife’s request should not be allowed. He argued that if the Wife took the position that the Husband was indeed richer than he had disclosed, that was a matter to be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. There was, in any event, sufficient evidence on record to show the Husband’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I will allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. As I have explained above (at [64]), it is unclear how the Husband managed to put together the financial resources to pay off the mortgage as well as his life insurance premiums. Although I had also ordered the Husband to disclose his bank statements from January 2010 to December 2016, the bank statements may not give the full scope of the work the Husband had engaged in on the side. The Husband could well have received payments in cold hard cash for the odd jobs that he had done. The scope of the Wife’s request in Item 4 goes beyond bank statements and includes documents such as invoices and payslips. These documents, together with the Husband’s bank statements, would paint a fuller picture of the Husband’s financial means. It goes without saying, therefore, that these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I shall deal with Items 5 and 6 together. This was the Wife’s request for source documents (such as statements, valuation reports, company resolutions etc) to support various details that had been listed in the financial statement of MX the financial years 2022 and 2023 respectively. During the hearing, Mr Chew clarified that the Wife was not proceeding with her request for the documents showing the increase in the amounts owed to third parties as the Husband had provided the relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As to why Items 5 and 6 were relevant and necessary, Mr Chew explained that the source documents were needed to ascertain the legitimacy of the loans which MX had taken out. This was because the value of MX, according to the Husband, was effectively zero – the value of the properties it owned was cancelled out by its debt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Mr Tan’s response was that MX was an exempt private company and, as such, was not required to file financial statements. According to an ACRA statement which the Husband had disclosed, MX had not filed any financial statements in the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan also emphasised that while the Husband did produce some company documents, this did not mean that he would be able to produce the rest of the company documents sought. This was because the Husband was only a 50% shareholder, and one of two directors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As a matter of strict formal logic, there is much force to Mr Tan’s argument that just because the Husband could produce <em>some</em> of the company documents, this did not necessarily mean that he could produce <em>all</em> of the company documents. The point which Mr Chew made, however, as I understood it, was that because the Husband was able to produce <em>some</em> of the company documents, the inference to be drawn is that these documents were in indeed his power, custody or possession such that disclosure should be ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I agree with Mr Chew’s point. I would also add that these documents were certainly relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters – they would shed light on the valuation of MX, and also allow the court to determine whether any adverse inferences should be drawn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 5 and 6 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Item 7 was the Wife’s request for documents to prove the source of funds used to pay for the Husband’s life insurance policy. As Mr Chew explained during the course of the hearing, the Wife wanted the documents to ascertain how the Husband had been able to afford the premium for this policy given his income. In other words, as I understood Mr Chew’s argument, the Wife wanted these documents to ascertain if the Husband indeed had deeper pockets than he had declared in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, and if so, how deep those pockets were.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Husband had disclosed some details relating to this policy in his first AOM. The surrender value of the policy comes in at $106,814.48. The documents also show that the Husband had made a single cash payment towards the premium.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It also bears noting that the Husband himself had declared, in his first AOM, that his salary in 2011 was SGD $2706 and his salary in 2013 was SGD $3000. The Husband also recounts that in June 2013, he had very reluctantly, “bitten the bullet” and acceded to his Wife’s demands to purchase the matrimonial home:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…Based on what I could find, my salary was only S$2,706 in 2011 (Annex 22). My salary would have been around S$3,000 in 2013 from my recollection. I knew clearly that purchasing the property would be a heavy burden given my salary. However, I thought of the children and as I was still young, I bit the bullet and purchased the Home, since the mortgage payments would only commence in 4 years. The purchase price was S$1,007,160 and the loan was S$705,000. As explained in paragraph 15.2 above, the downpayment was paid by me alone. If I knew that the Defendant would turn back on her word to sell the property, I would have never agreed to buy it…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Given what the Husband had disclosed, the documents which the Wife seeks are indeed relevant and necessary in two ways. First, they would allow the Wife, as well as the court, to assess whether the Husband had indeed made full and frank disclosure of his income and assets. Second, these documents could well reveal whether the Husband had <em>other</em> assets which he had yet to disclose. Although I had ordered the Husband to disclose his bank statements from 2010 onwards (see above at [63]), it could well be the case that the bank statements would not disclose the source of funds which the Husband had used to pay the premiums on his life insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 7.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I shall deal with the final two items (8 and 9) together. This was the Wife’s request for documents evidencing loans of about $1 million and $464,000 which both Mr B, as well as the Husband, had made to MX. Specifically, these were the requests the Wife had made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 8: documents such as MX’s bank statements as well as Mr B’s bank statements to demonstrate that $1,090,000 was owed to Mr B as of 31 March 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 9: documents such as MX’s bank statements as well as the Husband’s bank statements to demonstrate that $464,811 was owed to the Husband as of 31 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     Mr Tan argued that disclosure should not be ordered – the issue of whether the loans which had been made to MX were legitimate was, properly speaking, a matter for submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Insofar as Item 8 was concerned, it appeared that the Wife was essentially seeking discovery against a third party. Mr Chew clarified that this was not the case – rather, because the Husband had produced Mr B’s bank statements, this suggested that these bank statements were indeed within his possession, custody or power such that the Husband could be ordered to produce them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Mr Tan countered that the Wife’s request in respect of Item 8 was, in substance, an application for discovery against a third party. Given that Mr B was a non-party to the present action, the proper thing to do was for the Wife to take out an application for discovery against a third party (see Rule 71 of the Family Justice Rules 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The obligation of a party to give discovery extends to documents which are, or have been, in their possession, custody or power. This is enshrined in Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. The definition of the terms “possession”, “custody” or “power” are neatly encapsulated by the learned authors in Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, Family Procedure in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [63.03]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Possession” refers to both a physical holding of and possessory right over the document; “custody” refers to the physical possession but not the legal rights over the document and “power” refers to an enforceable legal right over the document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The commentary provided in the White Book is also relevant (<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 vol 1</em> (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“White Book”) at [24/1/4]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power” (r.1(1))—</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">This rule in effect embodies the practice and decisions under the former O.31 in the U.K. in regard to discovery of documents. Under that Order a distinction was made (following the old Chancery practice) between the obligation to make discovery of documents and the obligation to produce documents for inspection. There was an obligation to disclose documents which were or had been in the deponent’s possession or power and in which he had a joint property with other persons or no property at all, and also, semble, documents which were or had been in his mere custody (Bray, p. 225); there was no obligation to produce them for inspection (see Edward Bray, <em>The Principles and Practice of Discovery</em> (London: Reeves and Turner, 1885), pp. 196–209, 224–227). <b>The word “custody”, included in the present rule, makes clear that the party is under a duty to disclose documents belonging to others of which he has (or has had) mere custody.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Accordingly the party must disclose under an order made under this rule (and the court has power to order him to do so under r.3(1)) the following classes of documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    Documents that are or have been in his possession. Possession is distinguished from mere corporeal holding, i.e. custody. A bailee or agent has possession of documents entrusted to him for the owner; a servant, who has no legal right to possession, as such has merely custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Documents that are or have been in his custody. Therefore documents of a limited company, held by an employee or director ordered to make discovery, are included in one or other of these two classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    Documents that are or have been in his power. These include all documents which, though they are not in his possession or custody, he has an enforceable legal right to obtain from the person who has them (see discussion in <em>Anthony Wee Soon Kim v. UBS AG</em> [2002] S.G.H.C. 206, affirming <em>Lonrho Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/14132-E-M.xml')\">[1980] 1 W.L.R. 627</a>), e.g. where he is the owner and has not parted with the right to possession. It follows that the words include also:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)    Documents which are or have been in the possession, custody or power of any agent for him (see <em>Murray v. Walter</em> (1839) Cr. &amp; Ph. 114 at 125; <em>Swanston v. Lishman</em> (1881) 45 L.T. 360; <em>Mertens v. Haigh</em> (1863) 3 De G. J. &amp; S. 328; <em>Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Co. of Europe Ltd. v. Orion Marine Insurance Underwriting Agency Ltd.</em> [1995] Q.B. 174; [1995] 3 All E.R. 211 (continuing entitlement in principal after termination of agency in absence of express exclusion to the contrary to documents relating to acts done in his name during agency)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)    Documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power jointly with or as agent or servant of some other person (see cases cited under (a) above and <em>Taylor v. Rundell</em> (1841) Cr. &amp; Ph. 104; <em>Bovill v. Cowan</em> (1870) L.R. 5 Ch. 495).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     It is therefore clear that a respondent to a discovery application can be ordered to disclose documents belonging to a third party if those documents have been in his custody. In determining whether these documents have been in the respondent’s custody, it is relevant to consider factors such as the relationship between the respondent and the third party to which the documents belong as well as the nature of the documents in respect of which disclosure is sought. If the evidence discloses that the respondent has had access to the third party’s documents – that too is a highly relevant factor (see e.g.: <em>Sterilab &amp; Santé Global v Secretary of State for Health</em> [2024] EWHC 1708 (TCC) at [7] and [21] citing <em>Public Institution for Social Security v Al Wazzan</em> [2024] EWHC 480 (Comm) at [28] and <em>Berkeley Square Holdings Limited v Lancer Property Asset Management Limited</em> [2021] EWHC 849 (Ch) at [46])).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Returning to the present case, it was apparent to me that Mr B had a close business relationship with the Husband. Several pieces of evidence point me to this conclusion. For one, the Husband had recounted in his first AOM the extent of his business dealings with Mr B.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It is also worth noting that Mr B is the joint shareholder-director of MX alongside the Husband. In addition to this, the Husband had also disclosed, in his first AOM, Mr B’s bank account statements with specific transactions highlighted to show that Mr B had paid the Wife $590,000 to acquire her shares in MX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     That being said, the documents which the Wife seeks are Mr B’s personal bank statements. Even accounting for the supposedly close relationship between the Husband and Mr B, I do not think it likely that the Husband would have had custody of Mr B’s bank statements showing the loan of $1,090,000 made to MX. While the Husband did produce Mr B’s bank statements in his first AOM, I consider that he was able to do so because he had, in all likelihood, asked Mr B for help. This, however, does not mean that the Husband has had custody of <em>all</em> of Mr B’s bank statements – these are, after all, documents of a highly sensitive and personal nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The proper thing to do, therefore, was to take out an application for discovery against a third-party pursuant to Rule 71 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. Insofar as the Wife sought disclosure of Mr B’s bank statements in Item 8 – that request is, therefore, disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     That being said, I was of the view that the documents sought in Items 8 and 9 were certainly relevant and necessary given that they would cast light on the legitimacy of the loans made to MX by the Husband and Mr B. This has a direct bearing on the valuation of assets to be included in the matrimonial pool (assuming, of course, that the Husband’s shares in MX are eventually included in that pool). The Wife’s request in respect of Item 9 is therefore allowed. As for Item 8, while I disallow the Wife’s request, I will instead order that the Husband disclose documents showing that MX had received the sum of $1,090,000 from Mr B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1688 – The Wife’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     I deal first with the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 2. This was the interrogatory posed in Item 1 of the Wife’s application:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to particularise his employment history throughout the marriage, including but not limited to fully particularising “all odd jobs and work on the side” that he has allegedly done. This shall include details such as what was the job, number of hours spent on the job, remuneration of the job, how he was paid and where the monies from such “odd jobs and work on the side” were deposited into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This was the Wife’s request in Item 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state particularise his total income earned during the marriage, including but not limited to his employment income with [FG] and ‘odd jobs and work on the side’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Husband had objected to answering both these interrogatories in his response on the basis that it was not relevant, and in any event, he had provided the details which the Wife sought in his first AOM. The Husband also objected to this request on the basis that it was vexatious and oppressive. In response to the Wife’s claims that this interrogatory was relevant to ascertain the Husband’s claim that he was the main financial contributor to the family, the Husband also said, in his response, that the Wife did not, in any event, allege that she had made any contributions during the marriage, and she had in fact claimed that she was unemployed since 2007.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     This was what the Husband had said in his first AOM in relation to the odd jobs he had worked:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.9  As mentioned above, in May 2008, parties purchased their first matrimonial property at 899B Woodlands Drive 50. Since the Defendant did not have her own income or much savings, most if not all of the funds came from the monies I saved and sent to her. During this period, I often went to the supermarket to purchase groceries after work and cooked for the family after returning home. <b>After dinner, I will take out my tools and start doing repairs for people to earn some side income.</b> I have never slept before midnight, and it was common that I had to stay up until 1am or 2am. My health has been greatly affected and I am no longer able to work like that now sadly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Apart from this mention of doing repairs to earn some side income, the Husband provides no further details in his first AOM. He does not disclose how much he had made from these side gigs, nor has he provided details as to how long he continued to do these side gigs and where the money from these side gigs had gone to. I also add that while the Husband does disclose his <em>current</em> salary and make passing reference to how his salary had increased over the years, he does not really set out sufficient detail to piece together the total income he had earnt over the course of the marriage. The Husband also makes no mention of any salary he had earnt from [FG].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     In short, the Husband’s reference to his AOM cannot be, in my judgment, considered a sufficient answer to the Wife’s interrogatory as set out in Items 1 and 2. I will therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request in Item 3:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to particularise all the transfers made by him to pay down the mortgage loan for the matrimonial home between 2017 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Wife had explained that this interrogatory was relevant to ascertaining parties’ contributions towards the matrimonial assets. The Husband, in his response, objected to answering this interrogatory on the basis that it was irrelevant, vexatious and oppressive, and that the Wife had, in any event, not claimed that she had made contributions towards the matrimonial property. The Husband also pointed out that the Wife had claimed that she had been unemployed since 2007.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 3. It was not relevant, or necessary for the Husband to particularise all the transfers made by him to pay down the mortgage. What mattered more towards assessing his contributions towards the matrimonial assets was the total amount he had contributed to paying down the mortgage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     I come now to the Wife’s request in Item 4:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state and particularise the source of funds that he used to fund the various cheques that he wrote for the purchase of the 2 commercial properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Husband responded by referring to paragraph 16.13 of his first AOM. This was what he had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Between 2015 to 2018, the Defendant spent most of her time in China, claiming to have found good investment and business opportunities, and that she even set up a company and a shop with someone. After she returned to Singapore, she took away the savings which I had in the bank and borrowed some money from our mutual acquaintance, Mr B. She also requested that I send her my remaining savings. I obliged as I did not want to argue with her. As such, on 27 November 2016, I transferred S$125,651.00 to her (Annex 23) and on 13 April 2017, I transferred S$300,000.00 to her (from the cash sales proceeds of S$308,933.67 from the sale of the first matrimonial home) (Annex 24) for a total of more than S$425,000.00. The Defendant also took some money from a Maybank account. However, as the account was closed too long ago, I am no longer able to retrieve the records. All the money which I sent/gave the Defendant over the years was what I painstakingly saved by being frugal and working overtime. To clarify, the Defendant later transferred the following sums back to me on the dates as shown but they only add up to S$392,340.00: S$150,000 on 18 December 2017, S$142,741.94 on 21 December 2017 and S$99,597.59 on 25 December 2017.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    It is clear to me, having read this paragraph, that the Husband’s response is insufficient. The interrogatory asks the Husband to state and particularise his source of funds. In essence, the Wife wants the details of how he funded the two cheques for the purchase of the commercial properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> While the Husband had referred to paragraph 16.13 of his first AOM, this paragraph does not clearly disclose the details of his source of funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The Wife’s request in respect of Item 4 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I come now to the Wife’s final request in Item 5:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to state the total amount of monies paid for legal fees prior to the date of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    The Husband had, in his response, objected to answering this interrogatory on the basis that it was a matter of legal privilege. At the hearing, Mr Tan argued that there was no practical purpose to this interrogatory. In response, Mr Chew argued that while one could indeed claim privilege in answering an interrogatory, and that this would be considered a sufficient answer (see Rule 70(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014), the Wife’s position was that costs were not covered by legal privilege.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I disallow the request. This interrogatory was not relevant or necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. This is because the approach which courts have generally taken to legal costs of matrimonial proceedings is that parties should settle their own legal costs out of their own share of the matrimonial assets after division, and that legal costs should not be taken out of the matrimonial pool: <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25220-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 109</a> at [45] citing <em>UFU (M.W.) v UFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20826-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 23</a> at [105] citing <em>AQT v AQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0138.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 138</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    In summary, these are the orders made in respect of the four applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>SUM 1650 (Husband’s Application for Discovery)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of Items 1 – 8 of Annex A annexed to SUM 1650, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In addition, the Wife shall also disclose the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Any payslips that she may have, or be able to obtain (see above at [18]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power.

The Will further contained an express provision as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot; I DO NOT wish to give any of my property or personal properties to my wife, Mdm [Plaintiff] (Passport No. xxx) as I merely 'marry' her to help her extend her stay as an accompanying person to her child who is studying in Singapore. We are unable to consummate our marriage.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The deceased passed away on 2 September 2015 and grant of probate for his estate was subsequently issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on 26 January 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 30 June 2017, the Plaintiff commenced the present probate action to revoke the grant issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the basis that the Will is invalid due to the following<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the deceased was not of sound mind and memory and was unable to understand the nature of signing and executing the Will, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     in the alternative, that the signature of the Deceased was a forgery, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     in the alternative, that the Will was prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of “someone or some people”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Plaintiff further sought for letters of administration for the estate of the deceased to be granted to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Defendants denied the Plaintiff’s claim on the basis that they were bare allegations and asserted that the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity and had executed the Will of his own accord.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After considering the evidence and the submissions made by the Plaintiff and counsel for the Defendants, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim as I found that her allegations were bare allegations, unsubstantiated by the evidence and granted order in terms of the Defendants’ counterclaim. Dissatisfied, the Plaintiff now appeals against the whole of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Plaintiff is a Chinese national. She came to Singapore to accompany her daughter who was studying here. She first knew the Deceased in 2011 as his tenant and remained his tenant, until their marriage. The deceased was a bachelor who lived in a 3-room flat at Whampoa Drive, which he owned in his sole name. The flat had two bedrooms and a utility room. As he was a retiree, the deceased relied solely on the rental from the rooms of the flat for his income. Apart from his siblings, he did not have any other immediate family members as his parents were deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Plaintiff and the deceased subsequently married on 16 October 2013. They had a simple solemnization ceremony conducted in the living room of the deceased’s flat. The solemnization was attended only by the Plaintiff’s friend and the friend’s husband who acted as witnesses for the marriage. The deceased did not invite any of his siblings, other relatives or friends to the wedding. When asked by the Plaintiff why the deceased did not invite his siblings, the deceased simply replied that he and the Plaintiff would not have been able to proceed with the marriage if he did.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> After the marriage, the deceased continued to reside with the Plaintiff at the said flat at Whampoa Drive until about a month before his demise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Sometime, on xx October 2014, the Plaintiff and the deceased were interviewed by reporters from a local Chinese newspaper (“the Chinese newspaper”) on their marriage. Soon after, in October 2014, a newspaper article was published in the Chinese newspaper <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> on the marriage between the Plaintiff and the deceased being a sham marriage, which distressed the Plaintiff greatly. According to the newspaper article, after the marriage, the deceased and the Plaintiff slept separately without consummation of the marriage. It further stated that, as the Plaintiff ceased to pay rent to the deceased after the marriage, the deceased sought to divorce the Plaintiff but the Plaintiff refused. When interviewed, the Plaintiff denied that the deceased ever raised the issue of divorce and questioned why she needed to pay rent when they were already married.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     After the publication of the newspaper article, both the Plaintiff and the deceased continued to reside at the flat but the Plaintiff started paying the deceased $400 per month in November and December 2014. In return, the deceased issued the Plaintiff signed receipts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> certifying that he had received payment of $400 from the Plaintiff as “payment for the water and electricity bill, taxes and other miscellaneous charges”. The receipt further stated that “[the Plaintiff] is responsible for the daily living activities of [the deceased], including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene and accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 18 December 2014, the deceased signed a letter authorizing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the Plaintiff to put up one of the rooms in the flat for rent. The document further stated that the deceased and the Plaintiff agreed that the Plaintiff shall:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     be responsible for all matters relating to the room rental,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     bear all expenses related to the repairs, renovations, interior decorations and additional furniture and equipment in the rental room,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     pay the deceased $600 every month with effect from the date the room was rented out,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     be responsible for the water and electricity bill and taxes every month and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     continue to be responsible for his daily living activities including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene, accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In line with this agreement, the room was subsequently rented out from January 2015 onwards at $1,800 per month. The deceased then issued signed receipts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> to the Plaintiff from January to July 2015 certifying that he had received payment of $600 from her as “payment for this month’s room rental”. The receipt further stated that “[the Plaintiff] is responsible for the repairs of the room, the water and electricity bill, taxes and purchase of various utensils. [The Plaintiff] is also responsible for the daily living activities of [the deceased], including laundry, cooking, housekeeping, hygiene and accompanying him to his medical examination and other matters”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Sometime in July 2015, the deceased experienced breathlessness. The Plaintiff sent the deceased to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was admitted until 6 August 2015. Upon his discharge from hospital, the deceased was transferred to Ren Ci Community Hospital. However, his condition worsened and he was re-admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It was during this period of time that the deceased executed the Will on 17 August 2015 without the Plaintiff’s knowledge. He subsequently passed away on 2 September 2015. It is undisputed that prior to his death, the deceased suffered from diabetes, hypertension and, from about two months prior to his death, ischaemic heart disease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Circumstances leading up to the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Sometime after the deceased was admitted into Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the deceased contacted a family friend, L to visit him at the hospital. L knew the deceased for more than forty-five years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and the deceased would approach L for help from time to time with any issues that the deceased encountered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the hospital, the deceased stated to L that his marriage to the Plaintiff was a sham. He realised that the Plaintiff did not care for him and he did not wish to leave his flat to her. Being a senior director representing Great Eastern Life, with more than thirty years of experience in the insurance industry, L understood more about the execution of Wills than the average lay person.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> At the deceased’s instructions, L, with the assistance of his senior manager at the insurance office, prepared a Will in accordance with the deceased’s wishes i.e. for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be appointed as executor and the deceased’s flat to be left to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     According to L, although the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was the deceased’s half-sister, the deceased cared more for and treated her better than his other full-blooded sisters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This was because the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had gone through a hard life and was financially poorer than the rest of the deceased and his siblings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As such, the deceased wanted to leave her with the most valuable asset he had i.e. his flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At the deceased’s request, L contacted the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to inform him that the deceased had appointed him as the executor of the Will and requested for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to find two persons to witness the execution of the Will and an interpreter to explain the Will to the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then contacted his sister-in-law, C, who was well-versed in English and mandarin and requested for her to interpret the Will to the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He also contacted his mother, who was the deceased’s sister, to assist in the finding of two witnesses for the Will. It is undisputed that the two witnesses found was J ( the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s brother) and I (J’s friend).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On 17 August 2015, L brought the Will to the hospital for the deceased’s execution. Prior to the execution of the Will, C explained the contents of the Will in mandarin to the deceased who confirmed that he understood the contents of the Will before executing it in the presence of the witnesses. The witnesses then signed the Will in the presence of the deceased. After the Will was executed by the deceased and the witnesses, L kept the Will on the deceased’s behalf.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It is undisputed that the Plaintiff did not know of the existence of the Will until after the death of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Relationship between the Plaintiff and the deceased</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Much of the dispute between parties pertains to the relationship between the Plaintiff and the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     According to the Plaintiff, both she and the deceased shared a regular marriage life where parties cared for each other. The deceased would buy the Plaintiff food that she liked to eat and also demonstrate care and concern for her daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He even volunteered to be the sponsor for her daughter’s application for permanent residency.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The deceased also introduced the Plaintiff to his neighbours as his wife. As the deceased was a retiree with little income, both of them would share the daily living costs after the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff’s claim of a regular marriage life is disputed by the Defendants. According to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, he started visiting the deceased at the deceased’s flat after he learnt about the deceased’s marriage as he was concerned for his uncle’s well-being.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> During one of his visits in 2014, the deceased informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that he regretted marrying the Plaintiff as she had ceased to pay rental to him after becoming his wife. She also failed to take care of him despite her promise to. As a result, the deceased did not have any income or sufficient monies for his own needs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     This is corroborated by the evidence of L, a long-time family friend of the deceased. Sometime in 2014, the deceased had informed L that his marriage with the Plaintiff was a sham marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Although the Plaintiff had assured him she would continue to pay rent after the marriage, she ceased paying rental leaving the deceased with no income. As such, the deceased approached L for assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The deceased wanted to let others know of his sham marriage to the Plaintiff. As such, L made arrangements for reporters from the Chinese newspaper to interview the Plaintiff and the deceased at their home (“the newspaper article incident”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The details of the newspaper article arising from the interview is set out in paragraph 10 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     L’s version of events is disputed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff denies that the deceased had any involvement in or prior knowledge of the reporters’ visit to their home. The Plaintiff claims in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when the reporters first visited the deceased’s flat, they were brought to the home by the deceased’s sister. As such, the Plaintiff was under the impression that the reporters were also relatives of the deceased. It was only later during the visit that the Plaintiff discovered that they were reporters from the Chinese newspaper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Upon discovering that they were reporters, the Plaintiff acceded to the interview. However, just before the reporters left the deceased’s flat, they told the Plaintiff if she agreed to give up her inheritance of the deceased’s flat, they would not publish the interview in the newspaper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The next day, the deceased informed her that the reporters were patrons of his sister’s and nephew’s food stall and the reporters had gone to the deceased’s flat at their request. He also stated that they had nothing to fear if they did not do anything wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the trial, the Plaintiff gave a slightly different version of events. The Plaintiff alleged that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The reporters were brought to the flat by the deceased and his sister.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff was unaware throughout the entire visit that they were reporters from the Chinese newspaper.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While she was showing the reporters around the flat, out of the blue, they requested for her to write a note stating that she did not want the house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The next day after the article was published, the Plaintiff asked the deceased why he had brought reporters to the flat.

She immediately made her way to the hospital but before she could arrive, the deceased had already passed on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Upon arrival at the hospital, the Plaintiff noted that the deceased’s personal belongings were missing, such as his ATM card, identification card, cash and wedding ring. She was also informed by a nurse at the hospital that the deceased's relatives had been visiting him every night since 14 August 2015 and assumed that the deceased’s relatives had taken the said items.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Plaintiff initially claimed that the Will was only made known to her on 16 February 2016.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> However, at the trial, the Plaintiff conceded that she first learnt of the deceased's Will on 4 September 2015, just a few days after his death.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She received a call from L requesting that they meet at Tan Tock Seng mortuary to discuss matters concerning the deceased's funeral. At the time, the Plaintiff had no knowledge of who L was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     At the said meeting, L informed the Plaintiff of the existence of the Will but no document was produced. The deceased's siblings also threatened to report her to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (&quot;ICA&quot;) and to send her back to China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> It was subsequently agreed at the meeting that the Plaintiff would be responsible for the funeral arrangements of the deceased, which included cremation of the deceased’s body. The Plaintiff made the relevant arrangements and paid for the cremation of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Thereafter, the Plaintiff closed the deceased's bank account and withdrew the remaining sum of $3,222.45 from the account as cash, which she retained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff also applied to claim the CPF monies of the deceased. On 3 December 2015, the Plaintiff received a cheque for the sum of $39,989.76, being monies from the deceased's CPF account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 26 January 2016, the grant of probate was issued to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 16 February 2016, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and another of the deceased’s nephews showed up at the deceased's flat and informed the Plaintiff to vacate the said flat by 5 March 2016 as the Court has ordered the flat to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. At the time, the Plaintiff did not know who the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was or how she was related to the deceased. The Plaintiff asked for proof of the court order but they were unable to produce any documents in support of their claim. They then told the Plaintiff that they would return and show it to her another day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     A few days later, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant returned to the flat and showed the Plaintiff what appeared to be only the first page of the Will. This is disputed by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who asserts that he had brought the complete Will with him at the time and given a copy to the Plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that as she was illiterate in English, she would need to seek legal advice on the purported Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Plaintiff subsequently engaged solicitors to request for a copy of the Will from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant but to no avail. She also requested through her solicitors for an extension of time until 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2016 to move out of the deceased’s flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Plaintiff subsequently obtained a certified true copy of the Will and the Grant of Probate from the Family Justice Courts. According to the Plaintiff, this was the first time that she had sight of the full Will. She became suspicious of the Will as she found paragraph 6 of the Will to be untrue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> She also denied the signature on the Will to be the deceased’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     On 30 June 2017, the Plaintiff commenced this action to dispute the validity of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The formal validity of a Will is governed by Section 5(2) of the Wills Act 1838, as set out below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>“Rules as to formal validity</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.—(2)    A will shall be treated as properly executed if its execution conformed to the internal law in force —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    in the territory where it was executed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    in the territory where the testator was domiciled at the time —</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(i) when the will was executed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(ii) or of his death;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    in the territory where the testator habitually resided at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in the state of which the testator was a national at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b)…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Where the Will was executed in Singapore, Section 6 of the Wills Act 1838 applies:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Mode of Execution</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.—(1)    No will shall be valid unless it is <em>in writing and executed in the manner mentioned in subsection (2).</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Every will shall be <em>signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator</em>, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, and the signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator as the signature to his will or codicil <em>in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time, and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator</em>, but no form of attestation shall be necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As such, for a Will to be validly executed, it has to be signed at the foot or the end by the testator, in the presence of at least two witnesses present at the same time and subscribed by those witnesses in the presence of the testator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Testamentary Capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is established law that the propounder of a Will bears the legal burden of proving that the deceased had testamentary capacity to execute a Will.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Testamentary capacity will generally be presumed, and will be <em>prima facie</em> established, when the Will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances i.e. where the testator was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. One indication of testamentary capacity is the rationality of the Will, having regard to its terms and the identities of the beneficiaries. If the Will is rational on its face, the testator is presumed to have had testamentary capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Once the presumption of testamentary capacity operates, the party challenging the Will may rebut this presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary, such as evidence that the testator was suffering from a medical illness that was serious enough for the court to find that the testator lacked testamentary capacity. The burden of proving the unsoundness of mind lies with the person alleging it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Knowledge and Approval of Contents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Where testamentary capacity is established, a rebuttal presumption arises that the testator knew and approved the contents of the Will and the evidential burden shifts in the ordinary circumstances to the opponent of the Will to rebut this presumption.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The presumption will not operate where there were circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the Will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the Will did not express the mind of the testator. Circumstances which have nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the Will are to be disregarded. Only circumstances that attend to or relate to the preparation and execution of the Will are relevant. Conduct after the preparation and execution of the Will may be taken into account if such conduct has a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Whether the testator approved of or had knowledge of the contents of the Will is based on whether the testator understood:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     what was in the Will when he/she signed it; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     what its effect would be</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(See case of <em>Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGCA 0027.xml')\">[2010] SGCA 27</a>; <em>ULV v ULW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22704-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 2</a><em>;</em> and <em>Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18800-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 24</a>.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Undue Influence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the context of a Will, undue influence cannot be presumed. The burden of proof is on the party alleging the undue influence and in the probate context, it means coercion i.e. the testator is coerced into making a Will (or part of a Will), which the testator does not want to make. It must be shown that the testator was not merely persuaded but was pressured into losing his freedom of choice. The persuasion or pressure must have been of such an intensity as to overpower the volition of the testator without actually convincing the testator in his or her own judgment. It must be shown that the party accused of undue influence dominated the testator to such an extent that the testator’s independence was so undermined that the accused party’s domination caused the testator to execute the Will. This is a high burden of proving undue influence to vitiate any testamentary disposition. The test for undue influence in the testamentary context is therefore coercion alone. (See <em>UWF &amp; Anor v UWH &amp; Anor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26192-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 314</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48      <em>In Rajaratnam Kumar (alias Rejaratnam Vairamuthu) v Estate of Rajaratnam Saravana Muthu (deceased) and another and another Suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0093.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 93</a>, then Tan Lee Meng J held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“This is not easy to prove as undue influence in the making of a will is usually proven by the testimony of witnesses present at the execution of the wills or by forensic analysis.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Court’s Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the deceased have testamentary capacity to execute the Will?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Plaintiff alleges at paragraph 10 of her Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1) that the deceased was not of sound mind, memory and understanding at the time he executed the Will due to the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The deceased suffered a long history of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He was critically ill at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A part of his foot below his toes was amputated on or about 12 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He was heavily sedated with medication and barely awake.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the deceased of unsound mind, memory and understanding at the time he executed the Will?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     With regards to (a), the medical condition of the deceased is undisputed. With regards to (b) and (d), I found that apart from bare allegations, the Plaintiff did not produce any evidence in support of her claims. On the contrary, the Defendants were able to produce a medical report dated 20 September 2018 from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“the medical report”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> setting out the following information obtained from the documentation in the hospital’s medical records:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The deceased underwent left forefoot amputation on 12 August 2015 with no complications. Before and after the surgery, he was found to be alert comfortable, oriented to time, place and person. He himself signed the consent form for both the anaesthesia and surgery on 12 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He was not heavily sedated and was given peripheral nerve block anaesthesia for the surgery on 12 August 2015, at 7.19 p.m. There were no documented pre- and post-operative anaesthesia complications noted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the day of surgery on 12 August 2015, including the day the deceased executed the Will on 17 August 2015, the deceased's vital signs were stable, alert and he was not in pain or distress. He was even seen by the physiotherapist on 18 August 2015 with no complain of pain and was able to ambulate with minimal assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The deceased was competent to speak and understand what was said to him on 17 August 2015. The medical records showed that he was alert, comfortable, oriented to time, place and person and with stable vital signs on that day. He was not critically ill and did not suffer from any temporary incapacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This is corroborated by the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the witnesses – C, J, I and L – during the trial that the deceased was alert, able to recognise them and spoke normally with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the contents of the Will rational?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     During the trial and from the affidavits and evidence of the Plaintiff, it appeared to me that the Plaintiff’s main concern with the Will pertained to paragraph 6 of the Will, which stated that the deceased had married the Plaintiff in order to help her extend her stay in Singapore as an accompanying person to her child. It further stated that the deceased and the Plaintiff were unable to consummate their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Plaintiff asserted that the contents of paragraph 6 were untrue. She was able to produce documentary evidence to show that her applications for her Long Term Visit Pass in Singapore from the years 2010 to 2016 were sponsored by a friend, and not the deceased.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff further asserts that parties had consummated the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While the purpose of this trial was not to determine whether the marriage of the deceased to the Plaintiff was indeed a “sham marriage”, the nature of their relationship is relevant for the purposes of assisting the court in determining whether the contents of the Will is rational. It is clear from the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L that the deceased did have some blatant reservations, doubts and misgivings about his marriage with the Plaintiff. This is evident from the deceased’s conversations with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L and the circumstances leading to the newspaper article incident and the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In relation to the newspaper article incident, I found it difficult to believe that the deceased was uninvolved or unaware of the intentions behind the visit of the reporters to his flat, given his complaints to L prior to the incident. I note further from the Plaintiff’s evidence that no introductions were made as to the identity of these unrelated persons upon their arrival and it was the Plaintiff’s own assumption that they were relatives of the deceased. As such, I found it unbelievable that the deceased himself would bring strangers into his home for a visit without prior knowledge of who they were. There were also inconsistencies in the affidavit of the Plaintiff and her oral testimony, as stated at paragraphs 25 and 26 above, which I found difficult to reconcile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I also found it unusual that the deceased would issue receipts to the Plaintiff from November 2014 to July 2015 for payments made by the Plaintiff to the deceased allegedly in the context of a regular marriage. Although the Plaintiff claims that the receipts were unilaterally issued by the deceased to prove that the Plaintiff did her part to share in the family expenses as his wife, I found that the contents of the receipt appeared to be more of a clear delineation of the Plaintiff’s responsibilities as a contractual exchange between parties. This is consistent with the deceased’s complaints to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and L at paragraphs 16 and 17 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the above, I found that the deceased did not share the same view as the Plaintiff of the marriage being a valid one. Furthermore, given the deceased’s relationship and concern for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I did not find anything out of the ordinary for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to be stated as the sole beneficiary of his estate in the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In view of the evidence above, I found the contents of the deceased’s Will to be rational.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Presumption of Testamentary Capacity to operate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Based on the evidence before me, I am therefore satisfied that the presumption of testamentary capacity operates in this case. The Will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances where the deceased was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. The Will also appears to be rational on its face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Given that the presumption applies, the burden of proving that the deceased was of unsound mind at the time of execution of the Will lies with the person alleging it i.e. the Plaintiff. However, apart from bare allegations, the Plaintiff has not provided any evidence, such as independent medical reports, to support her claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As such, I find that the deceased was not of unsound mind, memory or understanding such that he was unable to execute the Will. On the contrary, the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity required to execute the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the deceased have knowledge of the contents of the Will and did he approve it? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Since the presumption of testamentary capacity applies, a rebuttal presumption that the deceased knew and approved the contents of the Will arises in the present case. In order to reverse the presumption, the Plaintiff needs to show that the Will had been executed under suspicious circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the deceased’s signature a forgery?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Plaintiff alleges that the deceased’s signature was a forgery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> However, apart from a bare allegation, I find that there is insufficient evidence provided by the Plaintiff in support of her claim. Although the Plaintiff had submitted a certified true copy of the deceased’s Will to the Health Sciences Authority to ascertain whether the signature on the copy of the Will was the deceased’s, as some of the sample documents and the copy of the Will itself were not original documents and did not contain the original signature of the deceased, the report from the Health Sciences Authority was inconclusive on whether the signature of the deceased on the Will was forged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> No other evidence was provided by the Plaintiff in support of her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Will prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of someone?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Plaintiff alleges that the Will was prepared and executed under suspicious circumstances or under the undue influence of “someone” or “some persons”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff alleges the following particulars in support of her claims:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the purported Will could not have been prepared by the Deceased as he has no knowledge of the English language and had no access to a typewriter or computer at the hospital,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the deceased soon died in hospital about 2 weeks after executing the purported Will,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the deceased did not disclose to the Plaintiff of his intention to make a Will,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Plaintiff seldom met any of the deceased's siblings during her visits to the hospital, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the deceased's siblings have acted with hostility towards the Plaintiff including vandalising the corridor outside the matrimonial home and bringing reporters from the Chinese newspaper to the matrimonial home unannounced to report that the Plaintiff's marriage to the Deceased was a sham which is untrue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In her Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1), the Plaintiff omitted to state specifically who had exercised undue influence over the deceased. However, from her affidavit and evidence, the Plaintiff appeared to be insinuating that the persons who were against her marriage with the deceased, being L and the deceased’s relatives, had conspired against her resulting in the alleged Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As stated at paragraphs 47 and 48 above, the law on undue influence is clear. It must be shown that the party accused of undue influence dominated the testator to such an extent that the testator’s independence was so undermined that the accused party’s domination caused the testator to execute the Will. The test for undue influence in the testamentary context is therefore coercion alone. This is a high burden of proving undue influence to vitiate any testamentary disposition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I find that apart from making a stab in the dark with bare allegations, the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to show that L, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or the deceased’s siblings had exercised undue influence over the deceased in the execution of the Will for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, it is undisputed that the deceased continued to live with the Plaintiff at the matrimonial flat prior to his admission into Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 6 August 2015. It was also the Plaintiff’s position that the deceased rarely met his siblings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> If that was indeed the case, it would appear difficult for the siblings to have any influence over the deceased given their lack of involvement in his life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to show that the deceased’s independence was so undermined by any of the deceased’s siblings or relatives such that they were able to coerce him into executing the Will. On the contrary, it is the Plaintiff’s own evidence that she visited the deceased every day when he was hospitalized and that she was his emergency contact. According to the Plaintiff, the deceased did not contact any of his siblings nor did he request for her to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In this regard, I find the Plaintiff’s evidence contradictory to her pleading of undue influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I also did not find any suspicious circumstances in relation to the execution of the Will for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Although the deceased was not literate in the English language, the deceased had instructed L to prepare the Will for him. The Will was subsequently interpreted and explained to the deceased before he executed it. The deceased did not need to have knowledge of the English language nor did he require access to a typewriter or a computer to prepare the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Notwithstanding the deceased died two weeks after the execution of the Will, there is evidence to show that the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the Will prior to his death.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given my findings in relation to the nature of the deceased’s relationship with the Plaintiff as stated at paragraphs 54 to 57 above, it would only seem logical that the deceased did not inform the Plaintiff of his intention to execute a Will disinheriting her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Although the Plaintiff may not have met the deceased’s siblings at the hospital, it does not eliminate the possibility of the deceased having met his siblings in her absence. In fact, it is the Plaintiff’s evidence that on 2 September 2015, she was informed by a nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital that the deceased's relatives had been visiting him every night since after 14 August 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e\"></a>(e)     With regard to the allegations of the deceased’s siblings vandalising the corridor outside the matrimonial home and bringing reporters from the Chinese newspaper to report on the alleged sham marriage between the deceased and the Plaintiff, I find that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       there is no evidence provided in the Plaintiff’s affidavit and her testimony in relation to the alleged vandalism.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       in relation to the Chinese newspaper article, I note that the incident occurred sometime in October 2014, almost 10 months prior to the preparation and execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       none of these allegations were relevant in relation to the actual preparation and execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     For the reasons stated at paragraphs 65 to 67 above, I find that the Plaintiff has not satisfied the high bar of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the deceased had executed the Will under the undue influence of “someone” or “some persons” nor were there any suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the Will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     With regard to the counterclaim, I accepted the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, C, L and the witnesses to the Will that the Will was duly executed by the deceased:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is undisputed by parties that the deceased was Chinese educated. He spoke mainly in mandarin and Hokkien.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     From the evidence of L, the contents of the Will were drafted in accordance with the instructions of the deceased. It was the deceased who requested for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be stated as the executor and for his flat to be left to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. The deceased further instructed that he did not wish to leave his flat to the Plaintiff as he was of the view that it was a sham marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the evidence of C and the witnesses to the Will, the contents of the Will was translated and explained to the deceased in mandarin. During the translation and explanation, C would ask the deceased whether he understood the contents of the Will and the deceased would nod and answer in the affirmative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Based on the medical report, the deceased was alert and was not temporarily incapacitated. He was able to speak and understand what was said to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_e\"></a>(e)     After the Will was translated and explained to the deceased, the deceased signed at the bottom of the Will, in the presence of the witnesses and followed by J and then I, who signed the Will in the presence of the deceased and of each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     As such, I find that the deceased did have knowledge of the contents of the Will and did approve the contents of the Will before voluntarily executing it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     In view of all the reasons stated above, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim and granted the Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiff for a declaration (a) pronouncing the force and validity of the Will dated 17 August 2015 made by the deceased and (b) that the Grant of Probate issued to the Defendants on 28 January 2016 be upheld.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Submissions on costs were adjourned to be heard at a later date. Parties have since submitted.

They had a child who was 11 years of age. Their marriage fell apart with interim judgment of divorce granted in June 2024. I divided the pool of their matrimonial assets, which comprised predominantly their matrimonial flat, 70:30 in favour of the husband. I also ordered that the parties share custody of the child, with care and control to the husband and liberal access to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Prior to the hearing of these ancillary matters, the husband had agreed to pay the wife a monthly sum of $660 for the maintenance of the child. I ordered that this arrangement continue, taking account of the modest income of the wife and the need for the wife to support the child during the liberal access that she had been granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The wife has filed an appeal against these decisions. I now provide my reasons for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In January 2017, the wife left the then-matrimonial residence, which was a room in an apartment that was owned by her mother-in-law, because of her “tumultuous relationship”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> with the mother-in-law. She took the child with her and headed to Indonesia, where she remained a citizen even after she had obtained permanent residency in Singapore. She returned to Singapore with the child in July 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, to avail of the healthcare infrastructure in Singapore. She moved with the child into the current matrimonial residence, which was a flat the keys to which had been collected by the husband in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The flat had been purchased in the sole name of the husband. He had applied to the Housing and Development Board to purchase the flat in 2013. He received a notice from the Housing and Development Board to collect the keys to the flat in 2017. Following delays, he eventually completed the purchase of the flat in April 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The primary matrimonial asset between the parties was the flat, which had been purchased in the sole name of and financed solely by the husband. It was not in dispute that the market value of the flat was $420,000 and the outstanding liability under the mortgage on the flat was $67,000. These figures produced a net value of the flat of $353,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband contended that he had taken personal loans from his family that totalled $35,000. He explained that he had done so to finance the purchase of the flat and its related expenditures. He submitted that his liability to repay the $35,000 should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. The wife denied this contention and asserted that the husband had “failed to substantiate the monies he allegedly borrowed from his family to purchase the matrimonial flat”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The husband exhibited bank records of two transfers that totalled $35,000 that he had received from his family. He deposed that these transactions had taken place at or around April 2019, which was the time when he had completed the purchase of the flat,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and which evidence was not challenged by the wife. Although these bank records were silent on the purpose of the transfers, I saw no reason to disbelieve the husband that the transfers were connected to the purchase of the flat given their proximity to the time when he had completed the purchase of the flat. On the evidence, these transfers had likely been advances to the husband for his purchase of the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Further, it was likely that the $35,000 had been advanced to the husband by way of a loan rather than by way of a gift. Although the contemporaneous documentation on the nature of the advance was scant, it was not in dispute that the husband had taken advances on his credit cards at or around the same time. There was no dispute that these advances on the credit cards of the husband were loans that the husband had taken. Given the proximity in the time of the advances taken by the husband from the credit cards companies to the time the advances taken by the husband from his family, I accepted the explanation of the husband that the latter advances were likewise loans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The value of the matrimonial assets was thus $318,000. This sum took account the $420,000 market value of the matrimonial flat, the $67,000 liability under the mortgage on the flat, and the $35,000 liability of the husband under the loans from his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties were in accord that the “structured approach” in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> governed the division of their matrimonial assets and that the husband solely financed the acquisition of the matrimonial assets. The direct contributions of the parties were thus 100:0 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The marriage lasted 13 years. The child of the marriage was 11 years of age. The wife was a homemaker for the earlier half of the marriage. During that time, she cooked and cleaned the matrimonial residence and looked after the child. But she then left the matrimonial residence for Indonesia for four years and uprooted the child in doing so. By default, the wife had made herself the sole caregiver of the child during these four years. But it was difficult to award her credit by way of indirect contributions for this arrangement. For these four years, the child was deprived of the care by the husband and of the benefits of co-parenting, which has “a positive effect on [child] development and well-being” (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> at [33]). Indeed, the child was cared for less by the wife and more by her relatives for much of these four years,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> which arrangement left the wife with limited parenting to perform. These four years also disrupted the education of the child, who was then of school-going age. Even so, the husband continued to maintain the child in the weekly sum of $150. He also visited the wife and the child in Indonesia three or four times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> When the wife and the child returned to Singapore in 2020, the husband provided for them from his income as a private-hire driver while the wife sought employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> After the wife found employment as a barista, the husband cared for the child from day to day when the wife performed night shifts that necessitated her sleeping in the daytime. In these premises, I assessed the indirect contributions at 60:40 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Averaging the direct contributions of 100:0 in favour of the husband and the indirect contributions of 60:40 in favour of the wife gave a final ratio of 70:30 in favour of the husband. I thus divided the pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of $318,000 (see [10] above) in the proportions of 70% to the husband and 30% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child welfare</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In considering the custody and upbringing of a child, the first and paramount consideration was the welfare of the child. That was the statutory imperative set out in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (2020 Rev Ed). And this entailed a multi-faceted and multi-factorial analysis that recognised that “welfare” had to be understood in its widest sense (see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The wife initially sought the sole custody of the child. The husband proposed that the parties share joint custody of the child. The wife eventually agreed with this proposal.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I thus ordered that the husband and the wife share joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The wife and the husband each sought the care and control of the child. The wife submitted that she was the primary caregiver of the child and that the child was closer to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The husband submitted that he was the caregiver of the child from day to day and had provided the child with a stable and secure environment that conduced to the best interests of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On a balance of probabilities, awarding the husband the care and control of the child conduced to the best interests of the child. The husband cared deeply for the child. Moreover, he had throughout the life of the child been ready and able to care for the child. Up until the child was removed from his care in 2017, he had participated in the upbringing of the child. Even when the wife had so removed the child, there was no evidence that the husband had failed to discharge his parental responsibilities. Rather, the wife had done so because of her unhappiness with her mother-in-law. Yet the husband did not let this removal of the child deter him from discharging his parental responsibilities to the child; he supported for the child as best he could by maintaining the child in the weekly sum of $150 and by visiting the child in Indonesia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> After the child was returned to Singapore, he provided shelter and a secure environment for the child that conduced to the development of the child. He cared for the child from day to day, and especially when the wife performed night shifts and slept in the daytime. He made time for the child whenever the child needed care by leveraging on the flexibility that he enjoyed in his work as a private-hire driver. He enlisted his mother, the paternal grandmother, to care for the child while he was at work. Ultimately, the husband was a hands-on father who had been immersed in the upbringing of the child and who was a capable caregiver for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The wife, like the husband, cared for the child. But she was prone to decisions in her self-interest that could come at the expense of the child. She removed the child from Singapore after a disagreement with her mother-in-law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> She did so without regard to the disruption that it would bring to the child, who was a citizen of Singapore, and without any viable plans on the caregiving of the child. For four months, she left the child with her relatives in Batam while she “shuttled back and forth [to] Singapore for work”. Only thereafter did she bring the child to Jakarta, where her family could care for the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These events disrupted the education of the child and upended the life of the child, who was shunted first from Singapore to Batam, then from Batam to Jakarta, and finally from Jakarta back to Singapore. This volatility would have been particularly jarring for the child, who had special needs and who had been barely four years of age at the time of these events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Leaving aside this capriciousness, concerns remained in how the wife would discharge the care and control of the child after the divorce. Her living arrangements were unclear, and her caregiving plans for the child were murkier still. She provided scant details on how she would shelter the child or on how she would care for the child given her variable work schedule that required her to perform night shifts and that in turn necessitated her sleeping-in during the day. To remove the child from the familiarity of the caregiving network that had been put together by the husband and his mother and introduce the child into this uncertainty was hardly in the best interests of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     For completeness, the wife alleged that the husband had abused her physically, mentally and emotionally. She claimed that she had left in 2017 Singapore “due to the tumultuous relationship she has with the [mother-in-law] and the lack of support from the [husband]”. She added that it was the husband who “suggested that [she] leave Singapore if she was unhappy” in 2017 and who would “shout at her to return to Indonesia” whenever they argued following her return to Singapore in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I struggled to accept that the wife had been abused by the husband. There was no evidence beyond her self-serving assertions that she had been so abused. The predominant reason for her departure from the matrimonial residence in 2017 was, in her words, her “tumultuous relationship” with her mother-in-law. Even if, as she alleged, the husband had not supported her during this turmoil, that omission did not establish that he had abused her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In any event, any turmoil between the wife and the husband or between the wife and the mother-in-law was not relevant to whether the husband or the wife could better care for the child. On the evidence, the husband had been a capable parent who provided a stable and secure environment that conduced to the development of the child. This stability and security were crucial at least in the immediate future, when the child would be taking a national examination. Notwithstanding the maternal bond, the child was close to and comfortable with the husband and the paternal grandmother, who had put in place workable arrangements for his upbringing. The interests of the child would thus be best served by placing him in the care and control of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Even so, it would be in the interests of the child for the husband and wife to co-parent the child despite any disagreements that they had between themselves. I thus granted the wife liberal access (including overnight access) to the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     access every weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     access for half of the school holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     access on alternate Chinese New Year holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The wife sought monthly maintenance of $1,000 for herself and $1,400 for the child. The husband submitted that no maintenance should be ordered for the wife but promised to “fully support his son financially in Singapore”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the wife, I agreed with the husband that no spousal maintenance was necessary. The wife earned a monthly income of $1,900. That income, together with her share of the matrimonial assets (which share amounted to $95,400), equipped the wife to support herself following the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For the child, it was not in dispute that the husband had during these proceedings provided the wife a monthly sum of $660 for the expenses of the child. Having awarded the care and control of the child to the husband, there was, in principle, limited basis to order the husband to finance the spending of the wife on the child. Even so, I had granted the wife liberal access to the child, including for most of each weekend and half of the child’s school holidays. Given these substantial periods in which the wife would be caring for the child, and given the $3,500 earning capacity of the husband, I ordered that the husband continue to provide the same sum each month to the wife for the expenses of the child. This sum would alleviate, at least for the near future, the financial load that the wife would be bearing while the child was in her care during access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I thus divided the pool of their matrimonial assets, which were valued at $318,000, in the proportions of $222,600 to the husband and $95,400 to the wife. I awarded the care and control of the child to the husband, with liberal access to the wife. I ordered the husband to provide the wife with a monthly sum of $660 for the expenses of the child while the child was in her care. I finally urged the parties to work together to co-parent the child in a manner that promoted stability in the caregiving and living arrangements of the child, especially in the immediate future when the child would be taking a national examination.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [36.2]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>2HAOM23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [32]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [49]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [50] and [52]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s Submissions at [55]–[56]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]–[31]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [30]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Wife’s Submissions at [36.2]–[36.3]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Personal Protection Order – Domestic Exclusion Order"],"date":"2024-08-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Personal Protection Summons No. SS 1541/2023, SS 1542/2023, SS 1543/2023 & SS 2261/2023","title":"XAW v XAX and other matters","citation":"[2024] SGFC 27","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31931-SSP.xml","counsel":["S.

INTRODUCTION</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These were proceedings by two sisters against their sister and brother for Personal Protection Orders (“<b>PPO</b>”) and domestic exclusion orders (“<b>DEO</b>”) to exclude them from their late mother’s home where they resided (“<b>Residence</b>”) (collectively referred to as the “<b>Applications</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>a)     SS 1541 of 2023 - Complainant (“<b>Sister A</b>”) for a PPO and DEO in respect of the Residence against Respondent (“<b>Sister B</b>”).

Filed on 31 August 2023 (“<b>SS 1543</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>d)     SS 2261 of 2023 - Complainant (“<b>Sister C</b>”) for a PPO and DEO in respect of the Residence against Respondent (“<b>Brother A</b>”). Filed on 18 December 2023 (“<b>SS 2261</b>”). This was filed to make reference to other incidents that had occurred since the filing of SS 1542.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>I will refer collectively to Sister C and Sister A as the “Complainants” and to Sister B and Brother A as the “Respondents”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The applications originating from the conflict and disagreements between the siblings over the care of their late mother (“<b>Mother</b>”). The Mother became ill around 2021 and was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2022. Sister B, Sister C, Sister A lived in the home together and took care of the Mother. They were also assisted by another sister, Sister D. It should be noted that Sister A and Sister C have their own residences. Sister C normally resides in Australia with her husband and Sister A has her own home elsewhere in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       During this period, the siblings found themselves in disagreement over the Mother’s care and the running of her household expenses and finances. They were split into two factions. The first faction comprised of Sister C, Sister A and Sister D. Sister C and Sister A were appointed as deputies over the Mother’s affairs and assets in OSM 167 of 2022 by an order dated 28 February 2023. The second faction comprised of Sister B and Brother A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The conflict between the siblings who continued to live in the Residence eventually escalated into verbal and physical altercations between the parties and on 31 August 2023, Sister C and Sister A filed SS 1541, 1542, 1543. On 7 September 2023, Sister C filed SS 1594 and 1595 of 2023 (“<b>SS 1594</b>” and <b>SS 1595</b>”) against Sister B and Brother A respectively for PPOs and DEOs in respect of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 29 October 2023, the Mother passed away. On 2 November 2023, the Court gave leave to withdraw SS 1594 and 1595.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 18 December 2023, Sister C and Sister A respectively filed SS 2260 and 2262 of 2023 against Sister B (“<b>SS 2260</b>” and “<b>SS 2262</b>”), and Sister C filed SS 2261 against Brother A. In these applications they also sought PPOs and DEOs against Sister B and Brother A, but filed these applications to make reference to incidents that had occurred after the filing of SS 1541, 1542, 1543 in 31 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 8 January 2024, SS 2260 and 2262 were struck off as the Complainant’s counsel was not present for their mentions. At a subsequent mentions on 16 February 2024, the Complainants applied to reinstate SS 1594, 1595, 2260 and 2262 as they wished to refer to the facts in these proceedings to obtain PPOs and DEOs against Sister B and Brother A in the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Court declined to reinstate SS 1594 and 1595 as the Mother was already deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Court declined to reinstate SS 2260 and 2262 as the facts referred to in these matters could be placed before the Court in the hearing of the Applications by giving leave to file a supplementary affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I only make reference to these matters for context, and because I was also required to provide a decision on costs in SS 1594, 1595, 2260 and 2262. In respect of SS 1594 and 1595, I made no order as to costs as they had been withdrawn due to the demise of the Mother who was the subject matter of the application. As for SS 2260 and 2262 I addressed the issue of costs wholistically together with the costs in the Applications as the allegations in SS 2260 and 2262 formed part of the facts raised in the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I proceeded to hear the Applications on 25 and 26 April 2024. On the first day of trial on 25 April 2024, Brother A informed the Court that he did not wish to participate further in the proceedings due to stress arising from personal issues. He stayed until the cross examination of Sister C was completed before lunch and did not return after that. He did not show up on the second day of trial on 26 April 2024 either.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 26 April 2024, I dismissed the Applications against Sister B and Brother A, and ordered Sister C and Sister A to each pay Sister B $6,000.00 in costs (for a combined total of $12,000.00 in costs).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 8 May 2024, Sister C filed her Notices of Appeal against my decision in SS 1542/2023, SS 1543/2023 &amp; SS 2261/2023. For completeness, I set out below my full grounds of decision in respect of all the Applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">B. THE LAW</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.    <u>Family Violence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Section 65 read with Section 64 of The Women’s Charter defines “<em>family violence</em>” as the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     “<em>Hurt</em>” as referred to in (a) and (b) above means “<em>bodily pain, disease or infirmity</em>”. The Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”) also clarifies that “<em>family violence</em>” does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">II.    <u>Physical Violence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The spectrum of physical violence, restraint or threats that can amount to family violence is quite broad. Findings of family violence have been made in the following cases involving a single act or repeated acts of physical violence, restraint or threats. For instance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A man prevented his wife from leaving the home by pushing her and holding on to the gate so that she could not open it (<em><u>NR v NQ</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52377-M.xml')\">[2007] SGMC 4</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A man had slammed sister against a wall when she grabbed him in order to restrain him from attacking her friend (<em><u>Tan Ying Hui (Chen Yinghui) v Tan Zhi Xuan</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0049.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 49</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">III.    <u>Continual Harassment</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Continual harassment was helpfully defined in the case of <em><u>Yue Tock Him@Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“<b>Yue</b>”) at [33] as :</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause and which he ought reasonably to know would cause worry, emotional distress of annoyance to another person…”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, given the infinite ways in which people are capable of causing distress or annoyance to each other, this should not be regarded as an exhaustive definition. That was also the view of the Court in <em>Yue</em>, which noted that the above definition was <em>“not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the term but rather one that sufficiently encompasses the facts of the present case in order to proceed with a consideration of the law.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17      <em>Yue</em> also provided at [42], that the acts of “<em>continual harassment</em>” must also be of a sufficiently serious magnitude in order to be regarded as “<em>family violence</em>”. Consequently, in the case of <em><u>Chua Li Choo v Teo Swee Theng</u></em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/49514-M.xml')\">[2005] SGDC 241</a>, at [22], it was held that making a police report did not amount to continual harassment. In that case, a husband had made a police report after the wife had locked him out of the marital home and told him that she would only let him in if he called the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     This approach is understandable. At the end of the day, and given the extremely wide scope of acts that may be raised as allegations of continual harassment, a sensible and balanced approach must be taken. After all, protection orders are meant to protect people from harmful acts, and if the threshold is lowered to include acts that are merely unpleasant but without sufficient gravity, then this may result in individuals abusing the court process to settle their own petty personal disputes or vendettas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">IV.    <u>Necessity</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even after a finding of family violence is made on the facts, the Court still has to make its assessment of whether it is necessary to grant a protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a protection order is not granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     This is because a personal protection order is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if there will be no family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (<em>Yue</em>, at [64]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In determining necessity, the Court must consider all the circumstances, but it is useful to weigh up the following factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>a)     Are the parties still living together or likely to remain in contact?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>b)     What is the original cause of the conflict and has it been resolved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>c)     The severity of the incident of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will now address the facts and the application of law to the facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">C.   Allegations of Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the Applications, a considerable number of allegations were made in respect of the Respondents’ conduct towards their Mother (reprising facts raised in SS 1594 and 1595), their personal affairs, and their interactions with persons other than the Complainants. I informed parties that while their underlying family disputes provided some context for their disagreements, I would not make a determination on them. I was mainly concerned with the allegations involving alleged family violence against each other, which I will address further below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">I.   Allegations against Sister B</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Calls to the Police</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Complainants alleged that there were numerous occasions during which Sister B had escalated conflict by calling the police to come to the Residence. This was not borne out by the evidence. Sister C was only able to identify one incident in 2022 where Sister B had called the police. Sister B stated on the stand that she had only made two reports – April 2022 and 3 December 2023. There was therefore insufficient proof that the police were being called down regularly to the Residence by Sister B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Flashing her underwear</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     There was a general reference in Sister C’s evidence, mirrored by Sister A and Sister D evidence, that “in past verbal jousts”, Sister B had lifted her skirt up at Sister C and Sister A, exposing her underwear. This was done to express displeasure and allegedly humiliate them. The evidence did not state any specific occasion or date when this occurred. Therefore I took the view that there was insufficient evidence that such acts had taken place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>27 January 2023 Incident – Alleged Physical Assault</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Here, it was alleged that during an argument on 27 January 2023, Sister B had accused both Sister C and Sister A of ganging up on her, and followed Sister A into the kitchen where she had hit Sister A on the back of the head with a closed fist. During the argument, she had also accused Sister A of being a “lallang” who vacillated in her loyalties and had taunted Sister C by wagging her tongue and making odd animal noises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I made the finding there was an argument. Sister B did taunt Sister C as stated. Sister B also admitted to calling Sister A “lallang” but claimed she only stuck her finger on Sister A’s forehead when asking her to use her own mind and not be biased in her opinions. I make the finding that Sister A was hit by Sister B on the back of her head, but it is more likely to have been a push of the head from the back as Sister A confirmed that she was still able to splash water on Sister B in response. It is clear that at the time, parties did not think much of the incident. There were no police reports made on the day or close to the date. No medical report or even pictures. It was only in 27 June 2023 when proceedings were contemplated that a police report was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>30 July 2023 – the “Shaitan” incidents</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It was alleged that Sister B had called Sister C a “shaitan” (a devil) on numerous occasions. On 30 July 2023, Sister B called Sister C a “shaitan” in the morning. Later in the afternoon, Sister B told the maid to play recorded Islamic prayers as there were many “shaitans” in the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     On this, I make the finding that Sister B called Sister C a “shaitan” not just on 30 July 2023, but numerous times. I also find that she asked the maid to play recorded Islamic prayers to ward off “shaitans” in the house later in the day on 30 July 2023. Nothing was said though about the volume at which these prayers were played at and if they were intolerably loud. While Sister B stated on the stand that she played these prayers every other day, there was actually no complaint by Sister C and Sister A about how regularly these prayers were being played. Therefore I took the view that Sister C and Sister A were not really affected by the playing of the Islamic recordings on 30 July 2023, and this cannot constitute a form of harassment. I also found that to address a person by a term of abuse may be offensive, but the law on continual harassment clearly sets a higher bar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>3 December 2023 – A video recording incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On 3 December 2023, during an argument with Sister A, Sister B took out her phone and started recording Sister A. Sister B admitted to doing so. I found that making a video recording of an argument cannot constitute harassment. There was nothing offensive or insidious about the recording. Both Sister C and Sister A admitted that all the parties in the video were fully clothed and not being captured in some embarrassing or indecent situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>31 October 2023 – 1st prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     On 31 October 2023, Sister C went to pray in the Mother’s bedroom with the helper. Sister B was already in the room, and once Sister C and the helper started praying, Sister B scolded them for not praying in the correct Islamic verse. After being corrected by the helper, Sister B remained silent. Both Sister C and Sister B did not dispute this version of events, save as to the tone that Sister B used when correcting Sister C and the helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I did not think there was an issue here. Sister B made a mistake about Sister C and the helper praying in the correct Islamic verse. After being corrected, the matter ended there. There was no need to elevate it to some form of harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>4 November 2023 – 2nd prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     On 4 November 2023, it was alleged that Sister B insisted to pray in a part of the Mother’s bedroom that Sister C had chosen despite Sister C having entered the room first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     This was an incident that was blown out of proportion. On cross examination, it was revealed by Sister C that while Sister C entered the room first, Sister B was the first person to enter the praying spot. At worst, it was just a disagreement. Sister C also confirmed that there were no angry or hurtful words exchanged between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>14 November 2023 – 3rd prayer incident</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On 14 November 2023, Sister C was praying in the Mother’s bedroom with one of the helpers. Sister B was talking loudly in the adjoining kitchen. After Sister C had told a helper to ask Sister B to keep her volume down, Sister B did so for a few minutes before watching videos of her grandchildren. Sister B also asked another helper loudly where the tomatoes were stored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     While I found that all of the above had happened, it is not clear that Sister B was doing so deliberately to upset Sister C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In my view, this was another incident which was blown out of proportion. It is not clear if Sister B was even aware that Sister C was praying in her Mother’s room at the start. As for Sister B’s conduct after being told to keep quiet, she did not speak loudly in an extended conversation. She was watching her videos and it cannot be harassment to just ask a helper once where tomatoes are stored. If Sister C had wanted some privacy and quiet when praying she should simply have asked the helper to shut the door to the Mother’s bedroom and the kitchen so that the noise level could be reduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">31   Allegations against Brother A</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On 25 August 2023, while Sister B and Sister C were having an argument, Brother A came down to the Residence after being asked by Sister B to do so. Minutes after arriving, he got into an altercation with Sister C and forcefully pushed her head backwards with the outstretched palm of his right hand. As mentioned above, Brother A did not participate in the proceedings other than sitting through Sister C’s cross-examination, during which he did not ask any question of her. He did not present himself for cross examination and did not make submissions at the conclusion of the hearing. I therefore found Sister C’s version of events had occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">32    <u>Conclusions</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To summarise, I found that Brother A had inflicted physical violence on Sister C, and that Sister B had inflicted physical violence on Sister A. However, Sister B had not inflicted physical violence on Sister C or continually harassed her and Sister A. The incidents between Sister B and Sister C reflected unpleasant and rude behavior on her part but did not amount to continual harassment. It cannot be that a case of continual harassment can be mad out by aggregating every mean word or gesture that has been exchanged between two sisters who cannot get along. Therefore I dismissed SS 1543.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">D.   NECESSITY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On the issue of necessity for a PPO or DEO, I understood that parties would continue to remain in the Residence and continue to remain in conflict as there would probably be a dispute over how the Mother’s estate would be administered. Sister C, Sister A and Sister B were also joint owners of the Residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     However, I noted that in respect of SS 1542 and 2261 (between Sister C and Brother A), both of them did not live in the same residence. Sister C stayed in the Residence and Brother A had his own home. The physical altercation between them on 25 August 2023 was a one-off incident. Therefore, I found there was insufficient likelihood that Brother A would be prompted to enter the Residence and assault Sister C. So, I dismissed the applications for a PPO and DEO in SS 1542 and 2261, noting too that the Residence was not a “shared residence” as defined under the Charter, section 64 for which a DEO could be ordered in respect of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In respect of SS 1541 (between Sister A and Sister B), the same issue also arose. Both of them did not live in the same residence either. Sister B stayed in the Residence and Sister A had her own home. No serious physical harm was caused to Sister A during the incident on 27 January 2023, and I also regarded the altercation as a one off. So, I also dismissed the applications for a PPO and DEO in SS 1541, noting too that the Residence was not a “shared residence” as defined under the Charter, section 64 for which a DEO could be ordered in respect of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">E.   COSTS</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Costs will be ordered against Sister A and Sister C in SS1541 and 1543. In Sister A’s case, there was one case of family but no necessity. In Sister C’s case, there were no cases of family violence that were found. Here, costs of a more significant nature would be justified as numerous events and facts were adduced by both Sister C and Sister A on their longstanding disagreements with the Respondents, which were only of tangential relevance to the case, which Sister B had to respond to in her evidence. This resulted in a total of 9 affidavits filed by the Complainants and 7 affidavits filed by the Respondents which had to be ventilated in a 2 day trial. The bulk of this evidence and work done in respect of responding to them by affidavit was wasted and thrown away as they were only of tangential relevance and excluded from cross examination to focus on allegations that might make a real difference to my decision i.e. the actual incidents of alleged family violence. So the appropriate cost order would be as follows : for SS 1541 – Sister A to pay Sister B costs of $6,000, for SS 1543 – Sister C to pay Sister B costs of $6,000. This would be all in, including disbursements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     On SS 1542, 2260, 2261 and 2262, I made no costs orders. For SS 1542 and 2261, Brother A was acting in person. For SS 2260 and 2262, the cost issues in relation to the allegations made in these matters had already been addressed by my cost orders in SS 1541 and 1543 and there was no need to duplicate them.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Yue Tock Him@Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a>, para 33</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2024-08-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 61 of 2024","title":"XAS v XAR","citation":"[2024] SGFC 58","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31925-SSP.xml","counsel":["Complainant in person","Respondent in person"],"timestamp":"2024-08-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheela Kumari Devi","html":"<root><head><title>XAS v XAR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAS <em>v</em> XAR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31925-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 58</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Maintenance Summons No 61 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 August 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sheela Kumari Devi </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Complainant in person; Respondent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XAS — XAR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 August 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Sheela Kumari Devi:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties (whom I will refer to as the <b>“Mother</b> and the <b>“Father”</b>) were married on 14 February 2007. They have three children to the marriage namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     [Child 1], 16 years old, born in August 2007 (<b>“[Child 1]”</b>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     [Child 2], 11 years old, born in March 2012 (<b>“[Child 2]”</b>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     [Child 3], 4 years old, born in October 2019 (<b>“[Child 3]”</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(collectively referred to as the <b>“Children”</b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father moved out of the matrimonial flat sometime in 2023. The Mother has been maintaining the Children on her own and applied by way of the present proceedings for a maintenance order to be made against the Father for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties appeared in person and the trial was conducted over a half day with the Father electing to have a court interpreter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother is about 40 years old and is presently employed as a domestic worker agent. The Father is about 42 years old and is unemployed. He is a bankrupt and states that he will be starting a new job as a market stall assistant in July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       At the conclusion of the hearing, I ordered for the Father to provide maintenance for the Children as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.76%\"><col width=\"40.1%\"><col width=\"40.14%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 1] :</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 2]:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$455</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[Child 3]:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$495</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father has since applied for legal aid and filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision. I shall now set out my brief reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother’s case is that the Father has not been paying maintenance for the past one and a half years. The Mother has not been able to manage the expenses of the household and the Children due to her limited income and has racked up credit card debts and accumulated arrears on the HDB housing loan as a result. The Mother also asserts that the Father must be employed due to instances when she has witnessed him driving and doing live videos on Facebook selling frozen food. The Mother also asserts that Father is continuing with the business of selling frozen food which she used to do together with him in previous years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father’s case is that he is only able to provide maintenance of $450 per month for the Children given his current financial position. The Father states that he has been unemployed for nearly 2 years. The reasons for his unemployment are as follows: (a) he only has primary-level education; (b) he has been imprisoned on 3 occasions; and (c) he was self-employed previously before becoming a bankrupt which has led to difficulties in gaining employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In applications for maintenance for a child, s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (<b>“WC”</b>) provides that “[t]he court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for [his] child who is unable to maintain [himself], order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The threshold issue is whether the Father has neglected and/or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Children. If neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance is established, then the court considers the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid. In this regard, section 69(4) of the WC sets out the factors that the court can consider when ordering maintenance, such as the financial needs of the relevant parties, the income, earning capacity and other financial resources of the relevant parties and the standard of living enjoyed by them, amongst others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(a)   Neglect</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s evidence that the Father had not been paying maintenance since he moved out in 2023 was not disputed by the Father. In the circumstances, I do find that the Father has neglected to provide maintenance for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(b)   The Children’s Expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I accepted the Mother’s lists of expenses for the Children (after she adjusted certain expenses on the witness stand for the first child) set out as follows:</p> <p

any specific objections to the expenses set forth by the Mother apart from just stating a general objection at the trial that the expenses ought to be lesser. This was in spite of the Court informing him that he could cross-examine the Mother on the specific expenses (if any) that he took objection to. However, he chose not to do so. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In my view, the Mother’s lists of expenses for the Children (after taking into account the adjustments she made on the witness stand) were reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(c)   Father’s Income and Earning Capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father states that he will be starting a new job as a market stall assistant in July 2024 and will be earning a sum of $1,500 per month. As such, he will only be able to contribute the sum of $450 for the Children’s maintenance. The Father states that he has had difficulty gaining employment over the past 2 years as he was self-employed prior to his bankruptcy. Other impediments to him gaining employment are his prison record and low level of education. The Father also states that prior to his bankruptcy, he was in the business of import and export and was earning an income of $10,000 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Father states that he has been able to provide for his own personal expenses by way of borrowing money from his father and his friends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother disputes that the Father is unemployed. The Mother states that she has seen the Father driving around in a car<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and has also been informed by her friend that the Father has been posting live videos on Facebook selling frozen food<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also states that parties had previously run a business selling frozen food together and she believes that the Father is still continuing on with this business in light of the Father’s Facebook videos<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s position, on the stand, was that whilst he had appeared on Facebook live videos selling frozen food, it did not necessarily mean that he was making money from it and that these videos were done for entertainment and marketing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Father also stated that the car he was driving belonged to his friend.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father did not produce any evidence of his efforts to obtain employment or to demonstrate he could not obtain employment that was commensurate with his previous earning capacity of $10,000. The Father also did not produce any evidence of the loans he had taken from his father and his friends to sustain his living expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having heard the parties, I did not accept the Father’s contention that he had not been earning any income for the last 2 years. No evidence was produced of his apparent efforts to gain employment and, also, of the loans that had been extended by his father and friends to pay for his expenses over these last 2 years. There was no cogent evidence put forward to demonstrate why the Father had not been able to procure basic employment over such a prolonged period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Overall, I find that the Father has not discharged his evidential burden to show that he is unable to afford and/or pay maintenance for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Whilst it was difficult for this Court to determine what exactly the Father’s income and/or earning capacity was in light of the dearth of evidence, I note that the Mother’s position was for parties to bear the expenses of the Children equally. This was notwithstanding the fact that she was not earning a particularly high take home income of $1,400 (which was not disputed by the Father). Whilst the Mother had professed hopes of getting better paying employment, this would not raise her income very significantly. In light of the Mother’s position (which I found to be reasonable) and using a broad brush approach, I was of the view that the Father should bear half of the Children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the reasons set out above, I made my orders for maintenance as set out at paragraph 5 above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 35</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, pp 38 to 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 37</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 41</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, pp 40 to 41</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 42</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Certified Transcript, p. 37</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Section 28 Family Justice Act 2014 – examination of children – expert evidence – access – video and audio recordings of children"],"date":"2024-07-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1294 of 2023","title":"XAB v XAC","citation":"[2024] SGFC 53","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31844-SSP.xml","counsel":["SC Teh Guek Ngor Engelin with Rebecca Vathanasin (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the Plaintiff","Yap Yongzhi, Gideon with Tan Shern Wen, Joshua (Martin & Partners LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-08-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Shin Yi","html":"<root><head><title>XAB v XAC</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAB <em>v</em> XAC </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31844-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 53</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

This application directly concerns the question of whether a young child of 4 years should be examined by a psychologist or qualified therapist, and also raised issues regarding the impact of high-conflict divorces on young children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I declined to grant the application in this case, as I did not find it necessary or in the best interests of the child to subject him to a psychological assessment. It is essential to first understand the background to this application, before I explain my reasons below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties were married in January 2016 and they have a young child, A, who is currently 4 years old. The Plaintiff mother (“the Mother”) filed for divorce in March 2023, citing the unreasonable behaviour of the Defendant father (“the Father”). Interim Judgment was granted on 20 June 2023. On 31 July 2023, the Father filed a Summons application for interim access to A (SUM 2404/2023). On 16 August 2023, the Mother filed a Summons application to restrain the Father from removing A from school before the end of the school day (SUM 2579/2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Consent Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 September 2023, the parties attended mediation in court and the following consent orders were recorded:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Pending the resolution of SUM 2404/2023 for interim access, the Father shall have interim access to A:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_a\"></a>(a)       From 5-6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays; during which time the Father shall take A to the nearby playground located at B Park. Such access shall commence on 18 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_b\"></a>(b)       From 9am to 1.30pm on Saturdays. The Father shall take A to a public place, including XX Club, and there shall be no restrictions as to who will accompany the Father during his time with A. Such access shall commence on 16 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The Mother’s domestic helper shall accompany A during all access sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The Father shall pick A up from the matrimonial home located at XY (“the Matrimonial Home”) at the start of each access session and return A to the Matrimonial Home at the end of each access session.

The application is for (i) a psychologist from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) or specific therapist to examine the child, A, for “purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”; and (ii) in the interim, pending the psychologist’s report, parties to have joint custody of A, the Mother to have care and control and the Father to have interim access as per the terms of the Consent Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother claimed that the application was necessary because A started behaving differently after the commencement of divorce proceedings in March 2023, and that the Father and his family members began to treat A “differently”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Mother claimed that (i) the Father started to take A up to his bedroom to the exclusion of her domestic helper, instead of allowing A to roam freely in his parents’ home; and (ii) the Father and his family members started “speaking negatively”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> about the Mother to A, telling A that he would be living with them and they would care for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother also claimed that the Father started<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> buying more toys to “bribe and manipulate” A, and picking A up from school and “prevented” the Mother’s domestic helper from exiting the vehicle to pick A up from the school lobby or only picked the helper up after he had already picked A up from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       More significantly, the Mother claimed that the Father and his family members had engaged in what she termed as “negative stoking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, which allegedly caused confusion and distress in A. She stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> A would often return to the Matrimonial Home after access “looking very disoriented and confused” and would have frequent temper tantrums and meltdowns; and would wake up multiple times in the night crying for the Mother, which he did not do before. The Mother also claimed that after A returned from access, he began<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> bed wetting and soiling himself or on the floor when he had previously been able to use the toilet. The Mother brought A to see a play therapist, who apparently informed her that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> there was a lot of “dysregulation” in A and that A is “very high need” and needs a “high level of control due to his insecurities”. Subsequently, the Mother brought A to a second therapist in September 2023, as the first therapist apparently “did not want to be involved”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in the Summons application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Mother’s case was that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> she filed this application as A had been “severely and adversely affected by the changes caused by the behaviour of the Father and his family members following the commencement of [d]ivorce [p]roceedings, particularly the negative stoking”, and she wanted the appointed psychologist to<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (a) work with A “through his feelings and help him to manage” his dysregulation; (b) assess A and “determine if he has been destabilised and/or negatively affected” by exposure to the Father and his family; and (c) make recommendations for the Father’s access to A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father submitted that the application was another bid by the Mother to “entrench her position”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> over A’s care and control, and to reduce his access to A as the Mother was really unhappy with the Father for not parenting A “in the way that she wants”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Father objected to the psychological assessment of A because he took the view that the assessment “may cause short-term and long-term harm”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The Father also submitted that a psychologist’s report would not be helpful because A is extremely young, and it would be difficult to ascertain any factual causes for A’s mental or emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father denied that he or his parents had engaged in any “negative stoking” of A, or that A’s movements were restricted in his parents’ home during access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. In response to the Mother’s allegations that A started to behave differently due to the different treatment by the Father and his family members after divorce proceedings began, the Father pointed out that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> the Mother’s accounts of events from March 2023 onwards showed that any change in A’s behaviour may not have been due to the Father’s or his family member’s actions. The Mother claimed that A began to act up in March 2023, and in April 2023, she changed her work arrangements to pick A up earlier to spend more time with him. The Mother again adjusted her work schedule subsequently so she could spend more time with A, and A then started full-day school in mid-July 2023. She also stated that the Father’s time with A did not change much from February to June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father also denied that he had spoken negatively of the Mother to A, and had only said to A that “<em>papa can feed you”, “papa can shower you”</em> or “<em>you can stay at por por’s house”</em> or words to that effect. The Father highlighted that before the divorce proceedings, the Mother had been fine with A staying at his parents’ home, and with his parents and sister helping with A’s care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law regarding examination of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Section 28 of the FJA 2014 provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>In any proceedings before a Family Court involving the custody or welfare of a child or involving a person, the Court may, on the application of any party to those proceedings or on its own motion, appoint a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child or person (as the case may be) for the purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The accompanying subsidiary legislation is in rules 35 and 36 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“the FJR 2014”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<b><em>35.-</em></b>(<em>1</em>)     <em>Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action of proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>4</em>)     <em>Where a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional who is not appointed by the Court pursuant to an application under paragraph (1) examines or assesses the child, no evidence arising out of the examination or assessment may be adduced without the leave of the Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>36.</em></b>      <em>When considering any question relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to any child, the Court may, on its own motion and with a view to obtaining a report on the welfare of the child, direct that the child be examined or assessed by a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or has experience in matters relating to child welfare.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Purpose of appointing a child expert</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Welfare of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Before ordering a child to undergo an assessment pursuant to section 28 of the FJA 2014, the assessment must be for the “<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in”</em> the proceedings involving the custody or welfare of the child. Similarly, rules 35 and 36 of the FJR 2014 provide that the expert evidence must be required in determining questions relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Women’s Charter”) makes it clear that the <b>paramount</b> consideration in all custody, care and control proceedings is the welfare of the child. The expert evidence is just one factor to be taken into account and the judge is at liberty to depart from expert recommendations if, after considering <em>all</em> relevant factors, they are not deemed to be in the welfare of the child. Indeed, section 130 of the Women’s Charter provides that the judge is not bound to follow the advice of a person trained or experienced in child welfare, when determining questions relating to the custody, care and control of a child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“130</em>.     <em>When considering any question relating to the custody, or the care and control, of any child, the court is to, whenever it is practicable, have regard to the advice of a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or experienced in child welfare but is not bound to follow such advice.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The assessment of a child is not simply a fact-finding exercise but may be better described as a forensic one, in order to gain <em>expert</em> insight/evidence on issues which are relevant to the proceedings in which leave for such assessment is sought. It should therefore be clear why the expert evidence is required, and what questions it would answer, relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In child-related proceedings in the UK, the court’s permission is similarly required before a child may be medically or psychiatrically examined or otherwise assessed for the purposes of providing expert evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The UK Children and Families Act 2014 provides that such expert evidence must be<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> “<em>necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings justly</em>”; and includes several factors which the court should consider in deciding whether to give permission for the examination or expert evidence. Such factors include (a) the impact of the examination or assessment on the welfare of the child; (b) the issues to which the expert evidence would relate; (c) the questions which the court would require the expert to answer; (d) what other expert evidence is available; (e) whether evidence could be given by another person on the matters on which the expert would give evidence; (f) the impact on the timeline, duration and conduct of the proceedings; and (g) the cost of the expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the relevant legislation in the UK is worded differently from section 28 of the FJA 2014, the factors in the Children and Families Act 2014 provide a helpful reference when considering whether assessment of children should be ordered and whether expert evidence is required. In <em>L v. J</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4764-M.xml')\">[1999] SGHC 258</a>, which concerned the variation of access and allegations of abuse, the applicant produced two psychiatric reports to support her assertion that the respondent’s conduct had adversely affected the mental wellbeing of the children. The court found the children’s psychiatric reports “unnecessary” and stated that it was in the children’s interests to keep them out of the dispute between the parents as much as possible. The High Court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> parties in every case should first consider whether a psychiatric assessment can truly be in the interests of the child, taking into consideration that such an assessment may take a toll on a young child’s mind and “<em>exacerbate feelings of guilt, anxiety and fear arising from the break-up of the family”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> the “<em>best course of action in any custody and access dispute is for it to be resolved… without the children being taken to see any counsellor or psychiatrist at all. </em><b><em>Seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for an assessment in order for the custody and access disputes to be resolved (as opposed to seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for therapeutic purposes) may damage the child by enhancing his awareness of the dispute between his parents, making him acutely conscious that he is the center of this dispute, and giving him the idea that his responses may have some influence in this dispute, and that he must therefore bear some responsibility in respect of its outcome</em></b><em>.”</em> [emphasis is my own]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Thus, it should be asked whether such <em>expert</em> evidence is really necessary, or whether the information sought may be obtained through other means which are less intrusive to the child, for example, by instead conducting a judge-child interview, or by ordering a specific issues report which is conducted by a court family specialist from FJC’s Counselling and Psychological Services (“CAPS”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Any psychiatric or psychological assessment, while not involving a physical examination of the body, should nevertheless be treated as a medical intervention. Just as a parent would not hastily insist that a child undergo surgery with general anesthesia to repair a sprained ankle, similarly parents should not be so eager to offer up their children’s minds and thoughts to be dissected and picked over by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Divorcing parents should recognise that custody disputes do <b>not</b> warrant immediate psychological or psychiatric intervention for children without good reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Utility of assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is important to ascertain the questions to be answered by the expert evidence. If the information sought by the court can only be answered by an expert and is not merely factual, then an expert assessment may be required. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court found that the expert<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>“<em>must give an explanation which supplies the understanding of the subject which the court lacks</em>”. In <em>In re C (Fam D)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/77525-E.xml')\">[2024] 1 WLR 1</a>, it was stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> an allegation of whether a parent had alienated a child against the other parent was “<em>a question of fact for the court to resolve and not a diagnosis that can or should be offered by a psychologist</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In <em>UVM v. UVN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23230-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 56</a>, the court found that the purpose of rule 35 of the FJR 2014 was to “<em>ensure that a child is not subject to unnecessary psychological assessment which could of itself lead to issues of its own”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></em>. It was noted there that the psychological assessment was conducted when the child was aged 2 years 8 months, and it was doubtful whether the answers from, or any tests conducted on, such a young child would be reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the ages of 3 to 4, children’s speech and thinking are still in the early stages of development, and their use of speech and vocabulary is extremely limited. Their cognitive skills are not fully developed, and they may not be able to express themselves clearly. A is only 4 years old now, and it would be difficult to elicit information from him which is useful for the current proceedings, even with the assistance of a trained expert. The Mother herself admitted that she did not apply for a custody evaluation report (CER) or access evaluation report (AER) because she thought that being only 4 years old, A “<em>may not be able to express himself to a CER or AER officer</em>” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. The Mother has not shown how a trained psychologist or therapist would be in a better position to elicit more information from A than an AER or CER officer (who is usually a trained counsellor or social worker).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Not therapeutic or aimed at fault-finding or attributing blame</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It is also useful to look at the reasons for which a psychological assessment of a child should <b><u>not</u></b> be ordered. It is clear from <em>JBM v. JBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16706-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 429</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> that the court-ordered psychological assessment of children is <b>not</b> meant to be therapeutic or preventive in nature. For completeness, <em>JBM v. JBN</em> pre-dated section 28 of the FJA 2014 and concerned the equivalent rule 41 of the now-repealed Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R 4) (“the MPR”). Rule 41 of the MPR is the predecessor rule to rules 35-36 of the FJR 2014; and is drafted in a similar manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>After proceedings have been commenced under Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a party shall not, without the leave of court, cause a child to be examined or assessed by any psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor or other social work professional or mental health professional for the purpose of the preparation of expert evidence for use in the proceedings for ancillary relief involving the custody and welfare of the child.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s application sought to have the appointed child psychologist help to “<em>address and manage any negative feelings”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></em> A may have, and to “<em>ascertain the reasons for his distress”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></em>. In the specific prayers of the Mother’s amended Summons, it is stated that the psychological examination of A is for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”, to set out the “assessment of A’s mental and emotional state”, and whether he has been “destabilised/negatively affected because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>recommendations for the Defendant’s access to A in light of his/her findings above</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother goes on in the affidavits to state that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>a child psychologist needs to be appointed to assess [A] and to recommend the care arrangements moving forward since:</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take cognizance of any of the troubling evidence before him of [A]’s distress; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take into consideration my observations of [A] despite being his primary caregiver.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“I am genuinely concerned about </em> <em><u>the Defendant’s behaviour and the effect it has had on [A]</u></em> <em>.

It is clear, as explained above, that ordering a child to be assessed for the purposes of preparing expert evidence <b>cannot</b> be therapeutic in nature. If the court determines that a child in divorce proceedings requires therapeutic intervention for his/her trauma or distress, orders may be made for the child to undergo counselling or therapy, or, in serious cases, to see a psychiatrist/psychologist to undergo treatment. That is however very different from ordering a child to undergo assessment for the <em>purposes</em> of obtaining expert evidence to assist the court in answering questions that only an expert can. The former is ordered for the primary purpose of treating the child, and not for the determination of an outcome in custody proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     An application for a court-ordered assessment of a child must not be used as a means of blame-attributing or fault-finding on the part of one parent. The assessment must be an objective forensic exercise necessitated for the welfare of the child. The way the Mother’s prayers in the application are phrased, what she seeks to be determined is whether A has been negatively affected “<em>because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>” and for the expert to make recommendations for the Father’s access to A “<em>in light of his/her findings above</em>”. The proposed questions to be posed to the expert are also based on the premise or assumption that A’s current emotional state is due to the Father and/or his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, and are self-serving. Even if the questions posed to the expert are reframed from those sought in the Mother’s application, I am of the view that there is no need for expert evidence of this nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     What is important here is that we deal with the issue of how we can help A through this difficult adjustment period in his life, and not subject him to a psychological <em>assessment</em> for the purposes of determining how much access the Father should have. I do not think that the exact causes of A’s alleged dysregulation can be determined by an assessment, given A’s tender age and limited ability to express himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     After considering all the relevant factors, I am not convinced that it is necessary or in the best interests or welfare of A to order a psychological or therapeutic assessment to be undertaken. I also do not see the utility of the expert evidence sought to be ordered in this case. While I do not doubt that A has been experiencing changes such as waking up and crying in the middle of the night, temper tantrums and a certain amount of regression with respect to his toileting habits, it is important to understand the effects of divorce and parental conflict on a child of his age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A was only 3 years old when the divorce proceedings commenced. Children of this age are too young to fully understand and comprehend changes around them. They are extremely sensitive to changes in their routine and daily life and are unable to express themselves clearly. Young children are also very attuned to the moods and feelings of their caregivers and the people around them, and may react accordingly. If a parent whom the child is close to is anxious or upset, the child may mirror the emotions of the parent by crying or throwing tantrums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Effects of divorce on young children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is not unusual that A feels the stresses and impact of the divorce and custody proceedings; and is thus acting out or exhibiting regressive behaviour. Constant exposure to conflict and stressors can severely impact a child. Even the observation of conflict between parents is a direct stressor for children, and divorce is a “<em>summary variable that represents a variety of circumstances that many children experience as stressful</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     On the Family Assist website hosted by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, it is stated that a child aged 3-4 years, who is exposed to the conflict of divorce, may become “clingier and throws more tantrums by crying, screaming, or kicking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the learned District Judge opined that “<em>Children in a divorce situation may feel more sensitive to the presence or absence of a parent than children in a non-divorce situation. They may need more reassurance that the non-custodial parent is a constant presence in their lives, in order to feel secure.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Parents should also be aware of the “normal” changes a young child goes through as they are growing up, through different stages of their lives. It is not uncommon for a young child to regress in development sometimes due to growing pains, stressful stages of their lives or picking up on parents’ anxiety and trauma. Young children who have been toilet-trained may occasionally wet the bed, or wake up multiple times a night where previously they used to sleep through. How can one distinguish whether this is a phase of development, or whether the child has been truly traumatised and requires professional intervention?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     One would only have to perform a web search for “child regression” to find that thousands of books, perhaps more, have been written on this topic. This is probably because regression is a normal part of child development and is usually in reaction to a stressor. A change in caregivers, in school timings, in routine, can all be potential stressors for young children who are unable to verbalise accurately what they feel at the tender age of 4. As children develop and adapt to new surroundings, some form of regression may be expected. Highly sensitive children may be even more prone to regression as they have been shown to be more reactive to changes in their environment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Since the divorce proceedings were commenced in March 2023, the parties appeared to have engaged in one-upmanship behaviour where each was trying to show that they were the better parent, or spent more time with A. The Mother also admitted that around April 2023, she changed her work arrangements in order to pick A up from school earlier. While the Mother claimed that the Father had also disrupted A’s routine and schedule by picking A up early from school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>, she admitted that this was only done over a 2-week period. The Mother claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> A’s dysregulation was at its “peak” between 22 July and 11 August 2023. However, the Mother herself also took A out of school early, and this was evidenced in the correspondence dated 13 July 2023 from the Father’s then-solicitors to the Mother’s then-solicitors<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. During this period, the Father also claimed that the Mother had reduced his access to A, as she was picking A up from school or his parents’ home early. The parties’ conflict culminated in an incident on 24 August 2023, in the presence of A, where there was a physical altercation and the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order for herself, and a Domestic Exclusion Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is also undisputed that A started attending full-day school from July 2023 onwards, which is yet another change to his daily routine. In short, A had experienced, in the short span of just a few months, many major changes in his daily life. After the proceedings commenced, A saw less of the Father, the parties took turns to take him out of school early, and he then started full-day school. His routine and schedule also changed in that previously, after school, he would spend time at his paternal grandparents’ home and the Father would return early to play with him before the Mother brought him back to the matrimonial home. However, the Mother then started to bring him back to the matrimonial home earlier, so that he spent less time with the Father and his paternal grandparents. A was also present during the parties’ altercation on 24 August 2023. All these changes could very well cause A to feel extremely insecure and unmoored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The “negative stoking”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Mother’s evidence that the Father and his family members had been saying “negative” things about her to A consisted mainly of: (a) her observations of A saying certain things like<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> “<em>does not want to go home</em>, <em>you can stay at por por’s house, papa can take care of you, papa can feed you, papa can shower you, you don’t need stupid mama, you can sleep on papa’s bed, you can sleep with aunty xxx</em>, <em>mama wants to take papa away, please don’t take my papa away, mama please return my papa</em>”; and (b) her domestic helper C’s affidavit evidence. The Mother concluded that since A was only 3 years old at the time, he would not know how to say such things and would only say them if they had been “told to him in this manner”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother also relied on several transcripts of audio and video recordings, presumably to show the effects of the “negative stoking” on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“[00:47] Kid: Such a very hard day.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>[00:50] Woman: Such a very hard day, huh?

Even where A apparently tries to hit the Father or refuses him, and I note that these video recordings were taken in October 2023, these incidents occurred at the height of the parties’ acrimony when there were access disputes and multiple applications filed by parties. Given the upheaval in A’s life at this time, it is not unexpected that he would exhibit adjustment issues and act out. The Father has also pointed out that there was also evidence of the Mother saying negative things about him to A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>, such as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>You are scared to talk to your Papa is it? Why are you scared to talk to your Papa?</em>”<em>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It is clear from the very voluminous affidavits and multiple transcripts of recordings submitted by the Mother, that she harbours strong negative feelings against the Father. A young child’s emotional state can be significantly influenced by that of his primary caregiver. It is likely that A could have picked up on the Mother’s strong emotions against the Father, thus causing him to be clingier to the Mother. It is also possible that A is emotionally affected by the Father’s frustration at the restrictions placed on his access, and acts out due to confusion. I point this out because I do not think that it is possible for anyone to definitively point to the alleged “negative stoking” of A as the determinative factor for A’s dysregulation or regression; there could be many other factors contributing to A’s emotional state. What is clear to me is that, on a balance of probabilities, the very acrimonious relationship between the parties, their conflict and constant litigation is causing stress and confusion to A, and both parties have a part to play in this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the circumstances, while I dismiss the prayer for A to be examined by a psychologist or therapist for the purposes of preparing expert evidence in the proceedings, I recognise that there is a need for A to receive some intervention to help him to cope with the parties’ conflict and divorce. I therefore order the parties to <b>jointly</b> engage a play therapist for A, for the purposes of helping A to deal with the proceedings and the parties’ acrimonious relationship. A report is not required as the play therapy is not required for the purposes of expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Using video and audio recordings of children for proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I had on 16 January 2024 ordered that neither parent or their agent is to take audio or video recordings of A with the other parent, and save for exceptional circumstances, neither party is to submit any further audio or video recordings of A in affidavit. I had explained to both counsel that especially for young children such as A, repeatedly taking video or audio recordings of the child with one parent for the purposes of proceedings is extremely detrimental to the child’s welfare. I was concerned as the Mother had, in a supplementary affidavit filed earlier, adduced almost a hundred pages of transcriptions from video and audio recordings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. In the Mother’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she also adduced further evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> of more transcriptions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>VZZ v. WAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27115-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 11</a>, I had stated that in adducing evidence of multiple video and audio recordings, parties should really consider whether such evidence is really of assistance to the court, and more importantly, the impact of such recordings on the welfare of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. The High Court had also stated in <em>CLB v. CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27071-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 3</a> that photographs, video and/or audio recordings <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>“<em>are not always of assistance to the court – they may capture a moment (or several moments) in time</em>” but they do not capture events or interactions leading up to, or after, that particular moment. While such evidence may be relevant, it may carry weight that is “disproportionately prejudicial” to its relevance. Repeatedly photographing or filming children is also extremely intrusive and may constantly remind a child that he/she is being “used” in court proceedings. There is also the concern<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> of the possible impact of such recordings on the child in the long run: how would the child feel knowing that his/her past actions, behaviour and words were captured as evidence and used by one parent against the other? </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, I would remind both parents that while one parent may have interim care and control and the other parent has access, it is <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>“<em>erroneous and unhelpful to co-parenting for the parent with sole care and control to hold the view that he or she is the better or more important parent”</em>. It cannot be over-emphasised that effective joint or co-parenting is important in helping children to adjust to divorce and separation. As stated in <em>TAU v. TAT [</em>2018] 5 SLR 1089:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“While the parties take issue with each other’s parenting style, they must know that it is their divorce that has ultimately taken the greatest toll on the children. The parties’ acrimonious litigation and relationship have produced terrible effects on their children, psychologically, mentally, emotionally and even physically. The children are sandwiched between the parties. The adverse effects of the divorce on the children far outweigh the disadvantages of each parent’s parenting style.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     A is a vulnerable young child who is bearing the brunt of the divorce proceedings and litigation, and it is the joint responsibility of both the Father and the Mother to help him through this difficult time in his life. A child needs <em>both</em> parents to be involved in his life in order to thrive, and while it may be difficult for one parent to accept the other parent’s different parenting style, I urge both parties to set aside their grievances against each other and work together towards ensuring that A is happy and healthy.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the Mother’s affidavit in support of SUM 2985/2023 filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023 and paragraph 23 of the Mother’s Written Submissions filed on 24 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 23(d)-(e) of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 24 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 14 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 17 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 23 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 Sept 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 34 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 36 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraphs 36-37 of the Mother’s Written Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 112 of the Father’s Written Submissions filed on 21 May 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraphs 46-47 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraphs 35-39 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Paragraphs 78-82 of the Father’s affidavit filed on 6 Nov 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>See section 13(3) of the Children and Families Act 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>See section 13(6)-(7) of the Children and Families Act 2014.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>[6] of <em>L v.

SUM 1631/2024 (“SUM 1631”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1632/2024 (“SUM 1632”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. My substantive decision in respect of both SUM 1631 and 1632 can be found in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Helena Amolak (“Ms Amolak”) argues that there should be no order as to costs for two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       First, that both parties had equally succeeded in their respective applications – if one applies the trite principle that costs follow the event, this would effectively mean that the costs which the Husband was entitled to in respect of his own application would be cancelled out by the costs he would have to pay in respect of the Wife’s application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Second, there was a moderately high degree of acrimony between the parties. In particular, Ms Amolak highlights the dispute between the Husband and the Wife over care and control and access to the children, and the extensive litigation that had taken place. There was thus ample reason, according to Ms Amolak who cited the High Court decision in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), to make no order as to costs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Mr Jevan Li (“Mr Li”), who represented the Wife, took a different view as to costs. He argued that the Husband should be ordered to pay costs of $1200 for SUM 1631. As for SUM 1632, the Wife should be ordered to pay costs of $300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Mr Li justifies the sums sought on the basis that SUM 1631 was the more contested and complex summons as more time was spent on this summons at the hearing compared to SUM 1632. Mr Li also highlights that more work was done in respect of SUM 1631 as compared to SUM 1632.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, this is an appropriate case in which to apply the principles laid down in <em>JBB</em>. I agree with Ms Amolak that there is indeed much acrimony between the parties which has had an impact on their two daughters. That much is clear to me from the various documents and reports on the record. I consider that making any award of costs in this case could well, as Ms Amolak points out,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> sow further discontent between the parties and potentially have a negative impact on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       There shall therefore be no order as to costs for both SUM 1631 and 1632.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at paras 4 – 8 and 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Probate – Validity of will – Forgery – Conflicting handwriting analysis"],"date":"2024-07-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/S 16/2020","title":"WZJ v WZK and another","citation":"[2024] SGFC 49","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31850-SSP.xml","counsel":["Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants."],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>WZJ v WZK and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZJ <em>v</em> WZK and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31850-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 49</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/S 16/2020</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">29 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff; Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZJ — WZK — WZL </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Probate</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Validity of will</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Forgery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Conflicting handwriting analysis</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">29 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The central issue in this case is the validity of a will which was executed in Malaysia (<em>Malaysian will</em>) about 7 months after the testator executed one in Singapore (<em>Singapore will</em>). The testator passed away on 20 October 2019 and very soon after, there was chaotic engagement amongst family members on the validity of the Malaysian will and who should rightfully benefit from the estate of the deceased. Such engagement involved various allegations made by family members against each other including what each believed would be the intentions of the deceased based on the tenor of his relationship with each member during his lifetime. The plaintiff is the son of the deceased. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the eldest daughter of the deceased while the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a lady who lived with the deceased in Malaysia for some time prior to the latter’s demise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Having heard the matter, I found for the plaintiff and declared the Malaysian will invalid. I ordered that probate be granted based on the Singapore will instead. I however dismissed the plaintiff’s application for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be removed as executor of the Singapore will and similarly dismissed the plaintiff’s application for letters of administration with the Singapore will annexed to be granted to him (or in the alternative, that he be appointed as the sole executor). The counterclaim was dismissed in its entirety. As parties could not agree on costs, I ordered costs of $90 000 (all in) to be paid by the defendants jointly and severally. The parties appeal against the substantive orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The deceased and his wife were divorced in 2005 and appear to have shared a cordial relationship after the divorce. From the union there are 3 children; 2 daughters and a son. As referenced above, the plaintiff is the deceased’s son, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is his eldest child and daughter. The other daughter will be referred to as the younger daughter for purposes of these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that the deceased executed his first will in August 2016 which left all his assets to his brother. It was also not disputed that the deceased then executed a will on 30 May 2017 in Singapore which effectively revoked the August 2016 will. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant suggested that the deceased was influenced by his other 2 children and their mother into executing the Singapore will. The will names the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor and trustee and the plaintiff as the subsititute executor if one of many listed events were to occur. Under the Singapore will, the estate of the deceased was to be divided equally amongst his 3 children. At the time the Singapore will was executed, the deceased was living in his ex-wife’s home to enable assistance for his medical appointments in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The deceased unfortunately suffered a heart attack sometime in June 2017 and was admitted to a Singapore hospital. After his discharge, he stayed with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at her home. It was the plaintiff’s position that the deceased was asked by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to leave her residence and he then lived in Johor from December 2017. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant stated that she did not ask that her father leave.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In any event, a third will dated 28 December 2017 was claimed by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to have been executed by the deceased in Malaysia. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as the executor and trustee and the beneficiaries of the estate are the deceased’s 2 grandsons. These are the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is not disputed that the defendants are close friends. It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position however that she only knew of the existence of the Malaysian will when informed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 8 November 2019. On 16 November 2019 the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant showed the Malaysian will to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who then claimed to have returned it and not to have taken note of the contents of the will save for the fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as executor and trustee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although there was communication between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and her mother on the existence of the Malaysian will in early December 2019, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant proceeded to file an application for probate in January 2020 based on the Singapore will. She claimed that she acted in this way as she felt pressure from her mother and siblings. Further, she claimed that she was not legally trained to understand the significance of acting in the way she did.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The validity of the Singapore will</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is trite law that the burden of propounding a will lies in every case upon the party propounding the will (<b><em>ULV v ULW)</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Section 5 and 6 of the Wills Act (1838) provide the rules for the formal validity of wills and the mode of execution, respectively. The Singapore will was properly executed. There was no allegation of a lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Both the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant together with their mother were present when the deceased executed the will in his lawyer’s office in Singapore. Its execution was in the presence of 2 witnesses, one of whom was the deceased’s lawyer (<em>the Singapore lawyer</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Although there was suggestion by the 1st defendant that the Singapore will was executed under the influence of her mother and siblings, this was not a challenge that she robustly pursued. It would also be rather odd that the 1st defendant was named as the executor and equal beneficiary, if there were such influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the Malaysian will was rejected </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     After the divorce between the deceased and his wife in 2005, the 2nd defendant stated that she came to know the deceased. She was an administrative staff member at one of the deceased’s companies from 2009.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It was her evidence that the deceased lived in a house in Johor more permanently from 2013 or 2014<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and travelled to Singapore during the weekends. She also said that she looked after him in Malaysia. In fact, she was present in the house when the deceased was found dead in the early morning of 20 October 2019 when she woke up from sleep. He was found only in underclothes and remained in that state on the floor of the home till the ambulance arrived. The plaintiff and other family members expressed their unhappiness at finding the deceased in such a state and pointed to a lack of care by the 2nd defendant whether fairly or otherwise, in taking care of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was the 2nd defendant’s evidence that the deceased went to a lawyer’s office in Malaysia to execute the Malaysian will on 28 December 2017. She claimed that she was present in the room when the deceased executed the will. She was named as executor and trustee. The execution of the will was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer and a former driver of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The deceased had assets in Singapore and Malaysia, including immoveable properties and businesses. Three of these businesses were named after the plaintiff perhaps suggesting a sense of closeness to his son. The Malaysian will however made reference to specific Malaysian assets while only referring generally to all other assets in the name of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(i) The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the witnesses to the execution of the Malaysian will could not be safely relied on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was the 2nd defendant’s position that the reason why there was a sudden change of heart on the part of the deceased leading him to revoke the Singapore will was because the plaintiff stole the title deeds to the deceased’s Malaysian properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This was disputed by the plaintiff who claimed that his father had told him on numerous occasions that the same Malaysian lawyer who had apparently drafted and witnessed the Malaysian will could not be trusted and that the lawyer had taken the title deeds to one of his properties and had sold the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The plaintiff had also stated that the deceased had on one occasion, asked his children whether he should lend S$35 000 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for a coffee shop business. Only the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in favour of this. The money was lent and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant engaged the Malaysian lawyer to assist in setting up the business. The business never materialised and the money unaccounted for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The suggestion from the plaintiff was that the Malaysian lawyer and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant cannot be trusted. In my view, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is to be believed on her position that the deceased was unhappy with the plaintiff thus prompting him to make a new will with the assistance of the Malaysian lawyer, why would his other children be removed from benefitting from his estate. His unhappiness was only with the plaintiff. I accepted the plaintiff’s position that there was much more that appears to have transpired between the deceased and the Malaysian lawyer in the past and between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the Malaysian lawyer which makes the Malaysian will a document that required further scrutiny.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is also in my view unbelievable as there was no reason for her to omit to inform the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant about the Malaysian will until the deceased had passed away almost 2 years later. They were both close and supportive of each other. It is more likely that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant always knew of the Malaysian will and not as she claimed, only in November 2019. In fact under cross-examination the Malaysian lawyer met with the plaintiff and his mother on 6 November 2019 but informed them that he did not have a copy of the Malaysian will with him. Soon after the visit, the Malaysian lawyer claimed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant informed him that she had given it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the latter arriving at the Malaysian lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 already having with her a copy of the will. Even at this point, knowing that the plaintiff wanted a copy of it, the Malaysian lawyer did not retain a copy nor inform the plaintiff that he was in possession of it. To complicate matters even further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under cross – examination denied passing it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also claimed that she never brought the Malaysian will to the Malaysian lawyer on 13 November 2019 and insisted that the Malaysian lawyer was mistaken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian will did not rather strangely, appoint the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor of the will (as was the case in the Singapore will) even though the impression created by both defendants was that the relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the deceased was extremely good.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While the Malaysian will is dramatically different from the Singapore will insofar as it relates to the beneficiaries named, the deceased did not choose to change his nomination for his CPF money which mirrored the distribution of assets in his Singapore will. If the deceased was so angry with the plaintiff that he chose to change his will to provide only for his grandsons, that anger did not find expression in the way his CPF money was to be distributed. This raises concerns with the evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on the reason why the deceased wanted to remove the plaintiff from his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There are in my view large concerns with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer and the second witness to the will. The plaintiff had consistently and vehemently insisted that the deceased had informed him that the Malaysian lawyer could not be trusted. This was echoed by his younger sister on finding out from the plaintiff that there was possibly a Malaysian will that was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> An aunt of the plaintiff and his siblings who lived in Johor since 2017 and visited the deceased often, stated that she was told by the deceased that he had executed a will that distributed his estate equally amongst his children. There was never any mention otherwise including any conversation that revealed that he had gone to a Malaysian lawyer to execute another will. In particular, the deceased never spoke of leaving anything to his grandchildren.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The aunt in fact shared that the deceased said that he would give a little more to the plaintiff and his younger daughter when he spoke of specific properties in Singapore and Malaysia as he felt that he had already provided more to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The aunt was not shown to have any greater affiliation to the plaintiff. Another witness lent force to the plaintiff’s narrative. A former driver of the deceased<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> who served him from 2017 till he passed on, spoke of having driven him to many places in Singapore and Malaysia. This included places where the deceased would meet the plaintiff and his younger sister, to the ex-wife’s home and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s home, suggesting that the deceased maintained a cordial relationship with all the family members even if there may have been challenges over the years. This former driver said that he was never asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. He also shared how the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s husband asked for a share of the deceased’s estate to be given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the latter had taken care of the deceased prior to his passing. There was no reason to doubt this piece of evidence which was also spoken of by the plaintiff and his mother and which transpired a few days after the passing of the deceased. It would be odd to have the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant provided for from the estate of the deceased when this was not in the Malaysian will. There are many possible reasons why the Malaysian will does not provide for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. One is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was promised a sum of money by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and possibly the latter’s husband if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would claim that such a will existed which would leave everything to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s children without drawing attention to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have wanted to distance herself from the Malaysian will which would at some point have to surface if it were to govern distribution of the deceased’s estate as she knew her siblings would be suspicious. By having the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant stated as the executor and trustee while enabling the only beneficiaries to be the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant prevented any attack or suspicion of the motives of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The question remains - was the will in fact a forged document? I found that the Malaysian will was in all probability a product of an attempt to deny the children of the deceased an equal share in the estate of the deceased and was not executed by the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The evidence of the two witnesses to the will was rife with irregularities and inconsistencies. The Malaysian lawyer claimed he had handled many legal matters for the deceased whom he had known for decades. He described the relationship between the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as close.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He went on to inform that the deceased executed the Malaysian will with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant present and that the deceased signed with him and another individual as witnesses. This second witness he first described as a “Malay guy” and only later when prodded during cross-examination, as a former driver of the deceased. In his affidavit, he claimed that he informed the plaintiff of the second witness but in court under cross-examination, he claimed that he did not tell the plaintiff who the witnesses of the Malaysian will were. There was no reason why he would not have if a will was executed. Under cross-examination he eventually confirmed that his affidavit was correct and that he did tell the plaintiff about the witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Malaysian lawyer went on to say that “<em>my former client informed me that he wanted to impress his thumbprint on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will as well</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It was the plaintiff’s case that the deceased never used his thumbprint on documents. No document other than the Malaysian will was produced to show that the deceased had a pattern of affixing his thumbprint together with his signature. The Malaysian lawyer who had apparently acted for him on various legal matters over the years did not ask why the deceased felt the need to do this. The plaintiff had given in evidence that he had seen the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant removing the cloth that was placed over the deceased’s body during the wake and on being asked why, she tried to distract from this. It was the suggestion of the plaintiff therefore that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have used the thumbprint of the deceased as he lay dead, on this Malaysian will. While truth may sometimes be stranger than fiction, I found no evidence to corroborate this. An attempt to forensically examine the thumbprint did not point to any conclusion. I did accept however that it was unusual that the deceased would have affixed his thumbprint on the Malaysian will when this was not his practice. More relevant is the fact that this was not done for the Singapore will 7 months before the Malaysian will nor the insurance forms which was signed 9 months after the Malaysian will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was of concern in another material way. He claimed to have been asked by the deceased to prepare his will. It is unclear whether the lawyer informed him of the need for a second witness or if it was the deceased himself who decided on bringing his driver to be his witness. The lawyer claimed to have prepared the will. Yet he did not have a copy of it when asked by the plaintiff for it. He stated that he gave both the original signed will and a copy, to the deceased. The Malaysian lawyer was not merely a witness to the execution of the will. In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> v <b><em>The Bank of East Asia Ltd</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> the lack of notes or retention of a copy of a will were not seen as detrimental if the lawyer was only a witness. It is certainly different if he prepared the will in his professional capacity. This may of course be a lapse in professional judgment but one of the reasons the lawyer gave in evidence for the deceased having approached him instead of a lawyer in Singapore was that it was cheaper to get it done in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He knew he was acting in his professional capacity and what his duties were given his vast experience in matters of this nature. No good reason was offered for not having kept a copy of a will drafted by him as a lawyer. Unlike the Singapore will, it was also not registered at a wills registry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     When pressed by the plaintiff for a copy of the will on 6 November 2019, the Malaysian lawyer provided an unsigned copy to the plaintiff saying that he managed to get that from a saved soft copy. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that the Malaysian lawyer told him that the deceased did attend at his office but never signed the will. Given that there was no signed copy retained, this was probable. It was also the evidence of the plaintiff that the lawyer informed him that cultural norms dictated that the only son of the deceased should inherit the estate and that if he wanted to, he could take steps to have that done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> This astonishing evidence if true has far reaching professional consequences for the lawyer. What is clear however is that no signed copy of the Malaysian will was retained by the Malaysian lawyer. The evidence of the plaintiff that he was informed by the Malaysian lawyer that S$25 000 was owed to him by the deceased for corporate taxes seems to find support in the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant herself who said she approached the lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 (after she came to know of the existence of the Malaysian will) as she was informed that there were tax in arrears as well as another debt that their father owed. There is also evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had wanted payments to be made to the Malaysian lawyer towards taxes in arrears.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian lawyer’s motive is unclear but the evidence of the plaintiff was compelling in its suggestion that the Malaysian lawyer conducted his matters in a rather casual way, without proper records. Even his answers to questions in court were rather insouciant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness in the larger context of the Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was troubling as well. He claimed to have met the deceased in Malaysia when he was out of work. He was employed by the deceased as his driver. He worked for the deceased for about a year. Thereafter, he left to work in Singapore for about 2 years and claimed to have worked for the deceased again in early 2017. He was not clear of which month in 2017 he ceased employment. He stated that he had driven the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the Malaysian lawyer’s office on many occasions. Under cross-examination, when asked who prepared his affidavit, he stated that it was the Malaysian lawyer. When asked to clarify whether he dictated the contents to the Malaysian lawyer, he said that it was in fact completely prepared by the lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer and that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will are very similar. Given that the witnesses to the Malaysian will were both called to give evidence, the drafting of the affidavit by the Malaysian lawyer for the second witness was inappropriate. The second witness under cross-examination, was also unable to identify the ex-wife and the children of the deceased accurately but insisted in his affidavit that he was told by the deceased that the plaintiff and his younger daughter were greedy, and that his grandsons of his older daughter “deserved” to inherit his estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>Such remarks crafted by the Malaysian lawyer and not coming from the witness himself was troubling. I noted as well that he had broken down in tears when asked about the will. He seemed very nervous which can be expected in court proceedings, but the degree of his anxiety in answering the question of whether he witnessed the execution of the will by the deceased was concerning. He claimed that he was just emotional thinking of the deceased who was like a father to him. This however, together with the parroting of evidence of the Malaysian lawyer in his affidavit especially when he is not fluent in English throws up concerns about the truthfulness of what was being said. It bears repeating that it was the evidence of the new driver who started to work for the deceased sometime in 2017 as well that he had never been asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. This was at odds with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer that the deceased approached the lawyer for many matters over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(ii) Evidence and conduct of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is somewhat incongruent with human nature for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was surprised on being told by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that there was a Malaysian will, not to have asked more about it nor about the contents. This is so given that the defendants were close, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was months ago seated in a Singapore law office aware that her father wanted her to be the executor of his will. Upon finally receiving the Malaysian will from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, she did not share it with her birth family knowing that they were no longer beneficiaries. Even if she were not curious and resisted the temptation of finding out if she was to benefit from the Malaysian will just as she was to have benefitted from the Singapore will, why did she not take immediate steps to be transparent with her mother and siblings upon finding out about the Malaysian will? It did not occur to her somewhat odd as well that despite her consistent evidence of being in a very close relationship with her father, she was so quickly removed as the executor of the Malaysian will. Even when she met her mother and the plaintiff on a flight to India by chance, she showed a picture of the will that appeared on her mobile phone and not the details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     While she knew that the Singapore will had apparently been superseded by the Malaysian will, she chose to apply for probate in Singapore based on the Singapore will. The application has been granted but the grant has not been issued. It was the plaintiff and his younger sister’s position that she had not done so as her demands for payment to be made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not agreed to by them nor their mother. This appears to have prompted her to stop the Singapore proceedings. I do not accept that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant chose not to extract the order simply because she was suddenly of the view that she should honour the later Malaysian will and no longer felt any pressure by her siblings to accept the Singapore will. Her insistence as well that she would gain nothing from the Malaysian will was to draw an artificial line between gaining directly from her father’s estate and indirectly through her children. The plaintiff’s insistence that the Malaysian will be forwarded for handwriting analysis made relations strained. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she felt pressured to apply for probate on the Singapore will is hard to appreciate because she had legal counsel, and she did not feel similar pressure when she eventually aborted the proceedings. It was in fact the Singapore lawyer’s evidence that he was not informed of a Malaysian will. On being told that, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant changed her initial position on having told her counsel of this to the position that he only knew there were Malaysian properties, and she was told that she could proceed to do the needful in Malaysia after getting probate in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she was very close to the deceased, especially having taken care of him in her house for a period, while the plaintiff was not. From the evidence collectively it appeared that the deceased’s relationship with his ex-wife and all his children had its challenges at times. I could not find any evidence that he was close to one child to the exclusion of the others. In any event, who he chose to leave his wealth to may have nothing to do with whether he was close to an individual or not. If that were the case, he would have likely left something for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant went on to say that the deceased was also very close to her sons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> suggesting that it should not surprise anyone in the family that her father left his estate to them. What is of significance is that although she never knew the existence of the will until after the deceased had passed on nor was she curious about its contents when first told, she stated in her affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…<em>my father impressed his signature on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will to avoid any ambiguity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In my view, her position that the deceased must have done so to avoid ambiguity is not something a person absent at the execution would be able to categorically say. Unless of course, she knew this from those who were present. Yet she claims that even her close friend, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant simply told her about the existence of the will in the month after the passing of the deceased. Further, why would there be a need to be concerned about ambiguity given that there were 2 witnesses? The Singapore will executed 7 months prior did not have a thumbprint and the deceased never executed documents this way in the past. Any position that his hands were weak and may tremble on writing was not accepted considering the history of the way the deceased acted and very specifically, the fact that he had signed on insurance documents in 2018 without the need to affix his thumbprint. These documents were handed to the plaintiff by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant when the plaintiff arrived at the deceased’s home after the latter’s passing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The defendants’ counsel submitted that the issue of the thumbprint was raised by the plaintiff only in their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1), thereby causing prejudice to the defendants and would need to be treated as fatal to the plaintiff’s case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The reference in the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) was clearly in reply to paragraph 46 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) which referred to the thumbprint having been affixed to “<em>avoid any debate as to the validity of the will</em>”. In any event, the defendants’ case cannot be said to have been prejudiced as leave of court to address this could have been sought if felt to be material. What is clear is that as a matter of practice, the deceased never affixed his thumbprint, and this formed the roots of the plaintiff’s position on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reliance on forensic handwriting analysis – to what extent?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With advancements in technology, the contribution of experts in handwriting analysis has been very helpful in the determination of many issues before the courts, be it criminal, civil or family matters. And much like any other science, there is often conflict in opinion. It is the responsibility of a court where there is such conflict to decide if the methodologies and equipment used has produced a more robust and hence more reliable conclusion by one expert as compared to another. In some cases, of course, both may be limited such that it would be safer to turn to evidence other than the conclusions drawn by the expert witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The plaintiff called on an expert who has about 23 years of experience and has given evidence in many trials prior to this one. He was provided a copy of the Malaysian will where 2 signatures (Q1 and Q2) are found. He was also given 3 specimens (S1-S3) which he did not consider to be good specimen as they contained signatures that were made by the deceased in 2013. He informed in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> that signatures done many years ago would not provide for a fair comparison. He went on to compare Q1 and Q2 with the signature of the deceased found on the insurance forms which sought disability benefits. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant appears to have filled out this form for the deceased. This specimen (S4-1 to S4-5) were signed on 1 September 2018 (i.e. 9 months after the Malaysian will of December 2017). As mentioned previously, this specimen also does not bear the thumbprint of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Having highlighted the similarities in the signatures found on the Malaysian will and the specimen document S4 which he pointed out showed a moderate range of variation, he went on to elaborate on the significant differences which lent to his conclusion that there is “strong support” that the person who signed on Q1 and Q2 <b>is not</b> the same person who signed on S4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> One of the limitations under which the expert worked however is the fact that only a copy of the Malaysian will was handed to the expert. This prevented stereomicroscopic comparative examination of the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     After his evidence was given, the defendants’ counsel called on an expert. The decision to call this expert came after hearing dates were taken which impacted to some degree, the preparation of the plaintiff’s case. I allowed the application regardless but allowed the plaintiff’s expert a right to respond. The defendants’ expert has 40 years of experience and similarly, has experience in giving evidence in court proceedings. This expert had the benefit of the original Malaysian will, the specimens S1 to S4 and the Singapore will (S5).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     She opined that the signatures in 2017 and 2018, the wills and the insurance company forms, respectively <em>“showed unsteady pen movement and angular and less fluently made curves</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> She also stated that signatures that were made on the same day also showed significant inconsistencies. She put it down to natural variation. She also gave in evidence that Q1 and Q2 showed no hesitation and stiffness in pen movement and no laboured drawing and re-touching of strokes which are associated with manual copying or stimulations. She was of the view that no tracing had been done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> She compared S4 (just as the plaintiff’s expert did) and S5 (the Singapore will) with Q1 and Q2. She commented that the design, size, pen movement and stroke fluency were similar to the natural variation in S4 and S5. In other words, I must first accept that the variations seen in the specimen documents are natural variations. I had no reason to doubt it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The expert for the defendants believed the deceased “<b>probably” signed</b> the Malaysian will. This is a conclusion that is less than certain. In the range of certainty, the highest certainty levels would be if the signatures in Q1 and Q 2 are referred to as “is written by” or “it is highly probable written by”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The expert also made a few observations about the analysis of the plaintiff’s expert. She pointed out what was already expressed as a limitation by the plaintiff’s expert, that is, that the original Malaysian will was not provided. She then went on to disagree with the description of a particular slant that appeared on the signatures in S4-5. She further disagreed with the plaintiff’s expert that there was a clear “pen lift” in Q2. She made in my view unfortunately, a comment on the plaintiff’s expert’s carelessness in that there were typographical errors, a wrongly labelled image and wrong paragraphing in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> which I do not believe reduces the weight that can be attributed to his core work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given that the defendants called on their witness late in the day, I gave the opportunity for the plaintiff’s expert to file a supplementary affidavit after examining the original Malaysian will and the Singapore will. He was able to conduct a stereomicroscopic comparative examination. He concluded again that the <b>author of the questioned documents was not the author of the specimens in S4 and S5</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The affidavit of another handwriting analyst engaged by the plaintiff and who resides in India was filed. He did not attend proceedings and was not subject to cross-examination and hence I ascribed no value to the same. He shared the opinion of the expert of the plaintiff who did attend these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given that the core issue in this case was the validity of the Malaysian will, parties were encouraged during a case conference to consider jointly engaging an expert to analyse the signatures on the Malaysian will with the hope that matters would then be resolved amicably. Much disagreement arose on the scope of the engagement for the analysis to be done by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). When parties finally agreed and a report appears to have been produced, the plaintiff chose not to rely on it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Section 116 (g) of the Evidence Act (1893) provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>“<em>The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks is likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>By way of illustration the section provides that the court can presume that evidence which could be produced but is not would if produced have been unfavourable to the person who withholds it. Relying on the legislative provision and referring to the case of <b><em>Harmony Shipping CO.S.A</em></b><b>.</b> v. <b><em>Saudi Europe Line Ltd</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> the defendants’ counsel urged the court to accept that the HSA report was unfavourable to the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The court in <b><em>Harmony Shipping</em></b> however was referring generally to witnesses of fact and the rule that there is no property in a witness. The defendants were invited to consider applying for the production of the HSA report but during a case conference on 2 May 2023, the defendants’ counsel had confirmed that his clients did not intend to seek production of the report. Further, even as the defendants’ were of the view that the plaintiff was “expert shopping” in relying on the report that was in fact produced and omitting the HSA report, they did essentially the same by calling on their expert so close to the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> the court was of the view that it should not speculate on what any withheld evidence may contain or be. What then were the circumstances in the case before me which prevented an adverse inference? Litigation privilege is one of 2 aspects of legal professional privilege, the other being legal advice privilege. The plaintiff relied on litigation privilege by satisfying the court that there had been a reasonable prospect of litigation, and the communications/document were for the dominant purpose of litigation. Litigation privilege applies to expert witnesses. The defendants were additionally not prejudiced by the omission to produce the report. The 2 reports, from qualified local experts with sound knowledge and utilisation of accepted methods of analysis were in conflict, highlighting the tremendous challenge in relying on handwriting analysis in this case. In any event, as stated above, there was nothing limiting the defendants from applying to produce the HSA report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In light of the fact that the reports that were submitted to court contained differing conclusions and given especially that the experts themselves could not categorise their conclusions with the highest certainty level, I chose to look at all the other evidence instead of relying on the handwriting analysis in making my determination. While handwriting analysis as a growing science is certainly helpful, it remains equally very much an art allowing for different interpretations of the same documents. In some cases, like this one, it would in my view be unsafe to select one over the other in deciding the central issue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was allowed to continue as executor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having found that the Singapore will was the last valid will, I considered the application by the plaintiff for letters of administration (with will annexed) to be granted to him or in the alternative, for an amendment to the grant appointing the plaintiff instead of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The alternative prayer was not feasible given that the Singapore will provide only specific situations where substitution could occur and none of the events had transpired. The closest reference to enable substitution was in the event the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could not take care of “her” affairs as distinct from the estate affairs. Even if the request is based on the position that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is unfit to act as executor, the court cannot go beyond the intentions of the testator. Further, there can be no amendment to the grant of probate as no grant has been made. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant aborted proceedings once an order in terms of the application had been obtained, short of the actual grant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I also dismissed the application by the plaintiff to apply for letters of administration (with will annexed). While there is in my view sufficient evidence to conclude that the deceased could not have executed the Malaysian will, I could not conclude with a high level of certainty as to the extent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s involvement in this. While there was clearly evidence that she knew of the existence of the Malaysian will, the level of her culpability or knowledge that the deceased never properly executed the Malaysian will would require some conjecture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s application for probate in Singapore, the order has been made. Further, the assets of the deceased are known, and the matter can be completed quickly enabling the shares of the beneficiaries to be received. It was the plaintiff’s submission<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> that since the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had proceeded to apply for a grant seeking to propound the Singapore will when she knew of the Malaysian will and had breached her fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, she should be removed as executor with the plaintiff stepping in instead. The reference to s 32 of the Probate and Administration Act (1934)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> would be misplaced as a grant has not yet been made. Section 32 refers to the revocation of grants and not setting aside orders made, as is the case here. Additionally, both executors and trustees owe fiduciary duties to beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate in relation to the administration of his estate. An executor essentially “calls in the estate” and ensures that the assets are converted into cash and pays off all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When he has done that, his duties as an executor are discharged. As she moves to fill in the shoes of a trustee, he owes a set of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries including the important duty of keeping and providing accounts to the beneficiaries (<b><em>Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another</em></b> v <b><em>Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff and his younger sister can hold the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant accountable for the proper administration of the estate including the duty to account which is a continuing one. There has yet to be a grant of probate – once issued, this would usher in the duties of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as executor and trustee. There is no need to unwind the steps already taken in these proceedings given the ability of the beneficiaries to monitor and insist that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant remain accountable to them as the person their father trusted to execute his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The outcome of this litigation was in the plaintiff’s favour. Essentially the plaintiff had been successful in proving that the last valid will of his father was the one executed in Singapore. The fact that I did not enable him to take over the administration of the estate from his sister does not make him the unsuccessful party. The central issue was determined in his favour and he should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Costs are in the discretion of the court and reference was made to Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (2021). I gave parties ample time to agree on costs, but they were unable to do so. The hearing took 6 days. Despite numerous case conferences before the matter was fixed, the defendants chose to indicate that they wished to call an expert handwriting analyst some 10 days before the commencement of the hearing, having already known of the nature of the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert. The matter was not simple and there were many witnesses of fact called by the plaintiff to provide evidence. A cost order reflective of the complexity and effort expended was necessary. The sum of $90 000 (all in) was felt to be a fair amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I ordered that the defendants be jointly and severally responsible for the costs as they participated in material albeit different ways to this litigation, which certainly could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this case, family members knew that a will had been left by their father to govern the distribution of his estate on his passing. Any information that is known by one or more persons that there may be yet another later will must be shared regardless of any concern about how it would be received or accepted. Any lack of transparency does not lend trust as to its authenticity. It also fuels frustration, disappointment, anger and unnecessary costs fighting each other in a courtroom. The money that these parties fought over was never money that was theirs in the first place. It was a gift. It was never to have them destroy relationships but to instead come together in their father’s memory with an even stronger tone to their relationships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The defendants were not honest and transparent in their dealings with the plaintiff and the larger family and it has occasioned this litigation and caused a great rift between them. Family in probate proceedings should be mindful of the unnecessary burden they place on generations after them from disputes of this nature.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 196 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22704-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 2</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Affidavit of 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 39.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 28 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcripts (Day 3) at pages 227 to 229, 232 to 234 and (Day 4) at pages 204 to 207.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 29 of the sister’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 20 of the plaintiff’s aunt’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>For clarity this is not the same driver who acted as a second witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 23 of affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 70 of affidavit of 20 April 2022 and Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 260-261.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19733-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 66</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 197, 20-221.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of the affidavit of the plaintiff dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Paragraphs 178-179 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Transcript (Day 4) at page 11, lines 8 to 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Paragraphs 26-28 of the affidavit dated 20 April 2022 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>Certified transcript (Day 2) pages 13 to 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 137.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>Paragraph 59 of defendants’ submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>Fancini, Simone Ling, “Expert Handwriting Testimony: Is the Writing Really on the Wall?” 11 Suffolk J.

My decision in respect of SUM 1739 and SUM 1684, which were the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, can be found in <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband argues that there should be no order as to costs The broad thrust of his argument is that if one proceeds on the well-established rule that costs should follow the event, although the Wife may be entitled to costs in SUM 1739, the Husband should be entitled to costs of SUM 1684. The costs ordered in either application would offset each other – effectively, there would be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, argued that because the Wife had succeeded in obtaining orders for discovery, she should be entitled to costs. In doing so, counsel for the Wife relies on the starting position that costs should follow the event. Counsel for the Wife further argues that there are no facts which warrant a departure from this starting point. In fact, they say that the Husband’s conduct further justifies why he should be ordered to bear costs. In particular, counsel for the Wife highlights that the Husband had unreasonably denied their requests for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for the Wife’s application for interrogatories, counsel for the Wife appears to take the position, though they do not explicitly say so, that if one applies the rule the costs follow the event, it is the Husband who should be entitled to costs because the Wife had only obtained orders in respect of one part of the four interrogatories which she had sought. That said, the Husband’s conduct justifies departing from the starting point – this is because the Husband had unreasonably refused to answer the voluntary interrogatories which the Wife had posed to him. The end result is that the Husband should also be ordered to pay the Wife costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As to the quantum of costs, counsel for the Wife submitted that costs for both applications should be fixed at $3815 ($3500 as legal costs and $315 as GST).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The starting point insofar as costs are concerned, is that costs should indeed follow the event. The Wife has succeeded in her application for discovery in SUM 1739. She should therefore be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As for the quantum of such costs, I considered the fact that the application for discovery only concerned one item and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also considered the reasonableness of the Husband’s objections to the Wife’s requests for these documents at the voluntary disclosure stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband had resisted disclosure on the basis that the request was not relevant, necessary or reasonable for the fair disposal of the ancillary matters, and that the Wife’s requests were: a) broad and oppressive and amounted to fishing and b) that she had not provided any adequate reason to justify the documents requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s objections must be viewed in light of the Wife’s request. In her request dated 6 March 2024, she states that these documents relate to the Husband’s “means, earning capacity, the pool of matrimonial assets and dissipation of matrimonial assets”. It is clear, from this, that she had indeed provided adequate reasons for seeking those documents. It is also clear, from the Wife’s request, how these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, specifically, the issue of whether matrimonial assets had been dissipated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It is therefore apparent to me that these documents could have been disclosed earlier. This is especially since the Husband did not object to their production on the basis that he did not have the documents sought.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Costs of SUM 1739 are therefore fixed at fixed at $900 (all in), to be paid by the Husband, to the Wife, by 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As for SUM 1684 which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, given that Wife was only successful in respect of Item 4(a), it cannot be said that she was the successful party in respect of SUM 1684. The Husband is thus entitled to costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     There was, in my judgment, no reason to depart from the general principle that costs should follow the event. I do not find that the Husband had acted unreasonably in resisting the request. As I had found, in my substantive decision in respect of SUM 1684, the Wife’s quarrel with his answers went to the truth of those answers rather than their sufficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As to the quantum of costs, I considered that SUM 1684 involved four items, and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact. I also considered the conduct of parties. It was clear to me, from reading the Husband’s answers to the interrogatories posed, that he had provided sufficient answers. As I have mentioned above, the Wife’s basis for taking out SUM 1684 was that she disputed the truth of the Husband’s answers. But that is not the purpose of the interrogatory process (see <em>eg</em>; Rule 70 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Costs of SUM 1684 are therefore fixed at $975 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife, to the Husband, by 30 August 2024.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 1739 at p 34 and 145.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Leave to file further affidavits"],"date":"2024-07-22","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)","title":"XAD v XAE","citation":"[2024] SGFC 54","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31851-SSP.xml","counsel":["Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XAD v XAE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAD <em>v</em> XAE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31851-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 54</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">22 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XAD — XAE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Leave to file further affidavits</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">22 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Husband is a Thai national, and the Wife, a Singaporean. They were married on 2 November 2015 in Thailand. They welcomed two daughters, [A] and [B], into their family. Relations between Husband and Wife were strained and bitter. That was evident to me from the matters narrated in the respective affidavits filed by each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The present dispute stems from the Husband’s claim that the Wife had wrongfully removed the younger daughter, [A], from her place of habitual residence in Thailand in May 2023. In response, the Husband took out an application in FC/OSG 163/2023 (“OSG 163”) on 15 November 2023, seeking custody, care and control of [A], and an order that she be returned to Thailand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As with all originating summons that are filed, the Husband filed his affidavit in support of OSG 163. The Wife filed a reply affidavit. The Husband has now taken out an application in SUM 1664/2024 (“SUM 1664”) seeking leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 12 July 2024. This is my decision in respect of SUM 1664.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable legal principles governing when leave would be granted to file a further affidavit</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties disputed the applicable legal principles which governed the granting of leave to file a further affidavit. At the hearing before me, and in their written submissions, parties strenuously argued that a different legal test should apply. I have summarised the essence of their respective arguments below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Daniel Loh (“Mr Loh”) argued that the starting point was that a litigant should be allowed to put all relevant evidence before the court. The court should err on the side of caution in assessing the relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced by way of a further affidavit – if there was any doubt as to the relevancy of the evidence, it would be best to simply allow the evidence to be adduced. After all, the main concern at the interlocutory stage was to ensure that all the relevant evidence was placed before the judge hearing the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Ryan Yu (“Mr Yu”), disagreed with the applicable legal principles as had been framed by Mr Loh. He argued that there were three cumulative requirements which had to be fulfilled before leave to file a further affidavit would be granted. First, the party seeking leave to file a further affidavit had to show that there were new matters that they wished to respond to. Second, if there were such new matters, one must consider whether the party seeking leave could have responded to those matters at the time which they filed their first affidavit. Third, one must also consider whether the matters which were now being raised were relevant to the disposition of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In determining whether leave should be granted to a party to file a further affidavit, Rule 508 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 is relevant. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Supporting affidavits</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>508.—(1</b>)     <b>Unless otherwise provided in any written law, a plaintiff who intends to adduce evidence in support of an originating summons must do so by affidavit.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The plaintiff must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on every defendant not later than 7 days after the service of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Unless otherwise provided in any written law, in the case of an <em>ex parte</em> originating summons, the applicant must file a supporting affidavit or affidavits at the time of filing of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The defendant who intends to adduce evidence with reference to the originating summons served on him must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The defendant must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on the plaintiff not later than 21 days after being served with a copy of the plaintiff’s affidavit or affidavits under paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<b>6</b>)     <b>No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 508 is identical to Order 28 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2014. It provides the manner in which evidence is to be adduced where an originating summons is taken out. The rules clearly provide that the applicant must file an affidavit in support of their application, and that the respondent, if they intend to adduce evidence in response, must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is therefore clear to me that the rules contemplate that both the applicant, as well as the respondent, are only entitled to file a single affidavit each – unless, of course, the court grants them leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There are good reasons for this. The absence of a hard limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed could well encourage parties to keep exchanging salvoes via affidavit thereby preventing the matter from proceeding to a hearing: see <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> at [69].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There are, of course, cases where affidavit evidence may simply be insufficient to deal with the matter. In such cases, the court has the power to order that the matter continue as though it had been begun by way of writ, and that pleadings be filed, or that any affidavits which had been filed to stand as pleadings: Rule 512 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     While there is a limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed in the context of an originating summons, this is not cast in stone. The reason for this lies in the general right of a litigant to bring all available evidence before the court. As was noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0110.xml')\">[2010] 3 SLR 110</a> (“<em>Basil Anthony</em>”), which had been cited by Mr Loh in his written submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The right of a litigant to bring relevant evidence before the court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24    At this juncture, we would emphasise that every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence relevant to his or her case to the attention of the court. <b>This general right is so fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in support of it; in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive decision or rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial approach to fact-finding.</b> The importance of the right is reflected in the fact that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to compel, on the pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to give relevant evidence, to come forward and give it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25     <b>The general right is, of course, subject to specific limits.</b> For present purposes, the following limits are germane. A litigant only has the right to adduce relevant evidence, as defined by the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and other applicable rules; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be considered by the court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as practicable, take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose is to ensure the fair, economical, swift and orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or collateral motives in an abusive or oppressive manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26    In striking the proper balance between the general right and the specific limits, a trial judge must not only be guided by the applicable rules and decisions, but must look beyond the mechanical application of these rules and decisions, and carefully assess the interests at stake in every case to ensure that a fair outcome is reached through the application of fair processes. It should always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow from the wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful, we are of the view that it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion. With specific regard to the calling of witnesses, we would reiterate what was said in <em>Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0427.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 427</a> (at [17]), where this court allowed an appeal to introduce eleven new witnesses of fact after the summons for directions stage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules and the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary to establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to be adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before the court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If, however, it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is unnecessary, irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control and is in a position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the witness and/or by an order as to costs. It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the court is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by a strict adherence to the rules of civil procedure. [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>Basil Anthony</em>, the appellant had taken issue with the trial judge’s decision to set aside his subpoenas to witnesses which he had intended to call. On appeal, the CA ordered a retrial on the basis that the appellant should have been allowed to subpoena those witnesses as they were in a position to give evidence on the key events on which the outcome of the case turned: <em>Basil Anthony</em> at [50] – [57]. It was in that context that the CA had made those observations on a litigant’s right to bring all evidence before the court, subject, of course, to any limits imposed by law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This general rule, that a litigant is entitled to put all relevant evidence before the court is equally applicable in the context of an originating summons. The Rules do allow a litigant to file a further affidavit, on the condition that leave of court is obtained: Rule 508(6) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The decision as to whether leave should be granted is a matter of discretion. In deciding whether leave should be granted, one factor which the court will consider is whether the further evidence sought to be adduced is relevant to the disposal of the matter. In other words, the evidence canvassed in the further affidavit must have some discernible nexus to the issues in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Naturally, in assessing the relevance of the further evidence sought to be adduced, one must also consider the issues in dispute. OSG 163 was an application taken out under s 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934. In that vein, s 3 of the GIA provides that the welfare of the infant is to be the paramount consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In assessing what is in the infant’s welfare, the court will consider factors such as the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, the child’s relationship with each parent and the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents: <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22083-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 49</a> at [51] – [52]; <em>VGK v VGL and VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24205-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 25</a> at [38] – [39]. In doing so, close attention must be paid to all the facts and circumstances of the case: see <em>e.g. AWN v AWO and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0228.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 228</a> at [4]; <em>UMF v UMG and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22974-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 640</a> at [39] – [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given the fact-sensitive nature of this exercise, I agree with Mr Loh’s point that at the interlocutory stage, one should take a broad view as to the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced. I would emphasise, however, that parties should still carefully consider the evidence that they are seeking to adduce – they must ask themselves whether such evidence is <em>necessary</em> to the disposal of the matter. That the court takes a broad view as to the relevance of the evidence is not a free pass for parties to file voluminous affidavits containing evidence that is not necessary to the disposal of the case. In such a situation, adverse costs orders may be made on the basis that that party has taken an unreasonable stance in the proceedings, and that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [9] citing <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In summary, these are the principles which I apply to determine whether leave should be granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit in OSG 163. For clarity, these principles which I have articulated should not be construed as bright-line rules.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, where originating applications are concerned, evidence is adduced by way of affidavit, and both the applicant as well as the respondent, are entitled by the Rules under the FJR, to file one affidavit each. That said, litigants have a <em>general</em> right to bring all available evidence before the court – and so, the court can, as provided for by Rule 508(6), grant a party leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As to whether leave should be granted, the court will consider the relevance of the evidence in the further affidavit. In the context of child guardianship applications, given the fact-sensitive exercise of determining what is in the infant’s welfare, the court would take a broad view in assessing the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties must bear in mind whether the evidence is indeed necessary to the disposal of the case, and any unreasonable conduct such as the filing of voluminous affidavits may well be dealt with by way of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband should be granted leave to file a further affidavit </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband exhibited a draft of the further affidavit which he sought leave to file. It contained three distinct parts. The first part (paragraphs 7 – 78) dealt with the following events which took place after OSG 163 had been filed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Divorce proceedings in Thailand dealing with the custody of the children. During the hearing, Mr Loh informed me that these divorce proceedings had recently concluded, after the Husband had sought leave to file a further affidavit in SUM 1664. There was therefore nothing in the draft affidavit disclosing the conclusion of those divorce proceedings, nor was there any evidence exhibited as to any orders made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Attempts by parties to settle OSG 163 amicably. The Husband sets out the chronology of negotiations with the Wife by which they attempted to settle matters. According to the Husband, the Wife had initially agreed to return [A] to him. However, after some four months of toing and froing, the Husband realised that the Wife was dragging her feet over the matter in a bid to delay the hearing of OSG 163 and to further alienate [A] from him, as well as her sister, [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 January 2024, the Wife withdrew her application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Husband. That the Wife withdrew the application, according to the Husband, demonstrates that her allegations that he had committed family violence was without merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Refusal to renew the elder daughter’s ([B]’s) passport. The Husband had instructed his lawyers to send a letter to the Wife’s lawyers. That letter claimed that the Wife had unreasonably failed to cooperate regarding the renewal of the eldest daughter’s passport. This meant that [B] was unable to travel during the Songkram festival (Thailand’s New Year public holiday).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The “Roblox incident”. The Husband explained that he would play games on Roblox with both his daughters. He explained this made them feel as though they were a family. On the morning of 8 April 2024, out of the blue, he received a phone call from [A] who told him, whilst sobbing between words, that she did not want to go back to Thailand. The Husband later discovered that this phone call had been recorded. He believes that the Wife had orchestrated the entire episode. Later that very day, at noon, the Husband logged back onto Roblox only to discover that he had been deleted as a friend on [A]’s friend list, and was blocked from adding [A] back as a friend. Apart from this incident on the 8<sup>th</sup> of April 2024, the Husband also details other incidents that took place over the Roblox application which, according to him, demonstrate that the Wife has been attempting to alienate [A]from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The second part of the Husband’s draft affidavit (at paragraphs 79 – 109) sets out his replies to the fresh allegations of fact which the Wife had raised in her reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The third part of the draft affidavit (at paragraphs 111 to 124) sets out the Husband’s reply to paragraphs 86 – 133 of the Wife’s reply affidavit. Mr Loh points out that these paragraphs in the Wife’s reply affidavit are not in response to anything which the Husband had said in his supporting affidavit for OSG 163. In any event, as Mr Loh explains, these paragraphs of the Wife’s reply affidavit set out fresh allegations which the Husband has not had the opportunity to respond to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As to the events set out in the first part of the Husband’s draft affidavit, there can, in my judgment, be no quarrel that they are relevant to OSG 163. The events which had been set out (above at [21]) paint a fuller picture of the family dynamics, as well as the relationship between the child and the parents, and whether there could possibly be any safety concerns on the part of [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for the second and third parts of the draft affidavits, I am also satisfied that the matters disclosed therein are also relevant to the disposal of OSG 163. In particular, the matters disclosed by the Husband in the draft affidavit are relevant to determining whether there has indeed been parental alienation as well as what would be in [A]’s best interests (<em>ie</em>, whether she should be educated in Singapore or Thailand) – these are issues which have a direct bearing on the determination of OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Leave is therefore granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit. As a final point, I add that I have taken a liberal approach to assessing the relevancy of the evidence raised, especially considering that the nature of the assessment undertaken by the judge hearing OSG 163 is necessarily a fact-sensitive one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In addition to granting the Husband leave to file the further affidavit, I also order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The further affidavit should also state whether the divorce proceedings in Thailand had been concluded and what orders had been made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s further affidavit is to be filed and served no later than the 29<sup>th</sup> of July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The costs of SUM 1664 shall be reserved to the judge hearing OSG 163. I do so because while I have taken the view that the matters raised in the further affidavit are relevant to the issues in OSG 163, I make no finding or comment as to whether they are necessary to the disposition of the case. The necessity of the evidence sought to be adduced in the further affidavit could, as I have explained above (at [19]), have a bearing on costs. That is, in my judgment, a matter best assessed by the judge hearing the substantive application. In that vein, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Loh and Mr Yu for their able assistance and their well-written submissions.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s draft affidavit at paras 52 – 54.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary matters – Division of matrimonial assets"],"date":"2024-07-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce 113 of 2022","title":"WZV v WZW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 52","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31843-SSP.xml","counsel":["Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife","Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband."],"timestamp":"2024-08-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Darryl Soh","html":"<root><head><title>WZV v WZW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZV <em>v</em> WZW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31843-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 52</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce 113 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Darryl Soh </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife; Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZV — WZW </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Darryl Soh:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). By consent, the Parties agreed for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of the marriage, with supervised access to the Husband. The Parties could not however agree on the financial and children’s custody orders. In respect of the division of matrimonial assets, the Parties disagreed on the satisfaction of the Wife’s personal liabilities from the pool of matrimonial assets and the indirect contributions ratio to be ascribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 17 April 2024, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children, for the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total monthly children’s maintenance of $890.00. The Husband was dissatisfied with the orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets and filed a Notice of Appeal on 24 April 2024. In these grounds, I explain my decision on the division of matrimonial assets in greater detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties are in their 40s and they were married in 2004 after they first met as colleagues. The Husband is presently employed in the security industry and the Wife is in an administrative role. After they were married, they temporarily resided in the home of the Husband’s parents. The Parties subsequently purchased their matrimonial home (“Matrimonial Home”) a year later and they moved into it together with the Husband’s family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Parties are blessed with two children, both of whom are in or around their teenage years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Difficulties in the marriage arose sometime a year after their marriage and the Parties had numerous disputes that led to heated quarrels. Years later from February 2017, the Parties ceased living together as husband and wife. They however continued to reside in the Matrimonial Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 10 January 2022 on the basis that the Husband behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. The Husband subsequently filed his Defence and Counterclaim on 4 February 2022. The Parties subsequently came to an agreement and the divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis on the fact that the Parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ. The marriage was dissolved, and Interim Judgment was granted on 6 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues in Dispute and Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Parties filed the following affidavits in respect of the ancillary reliefs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 6 June 2023 (“WAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 June 2023 (“HAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 22 September 2023 (“H2AM”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 25 September 2023 (“W2AM”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The hearing of the ancillary reliefs took place over three days, on 22 January 2022, 9 January 2024, and 17 April 2024. In respect of the children’s care orders, I recorded the Parties’ consent for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of marriage, with supervised access to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children. In respect of the financial orders, I ordered the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, no spousal maintenance for the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total of $890.00 monthly for the two children’s maintenance. To achieve a division as close to the said ratio of 63.82:36.18, I made the following consequential distribution orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    The [Matrimonial Home] … shall be sold on the open market within 9 months of the Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows: -.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    To make full payment of the outstanding housing loan to the bank (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    To pay the HDB resale levy (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">c.    To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">d.    The balance net sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 78% to the [Wife] and 22% to the [Husband];</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">e.    Each party shall pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to party's respective CPF accounts from the party's proportion of the balance sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">i.    In the event the [Husband] is unable to pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to his CPF accounts from his proportion of the balance sale proceeds, the [Wife] shall transfer from her CPF account to top-up the said shortfall CPF monies into the [Husband’s] CPF account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">ii.    After the completion of sale of the matrimonial flat, the [Husband] shall transfer back the said shortfall CPF monies from his CPF account to the [Wife’s] CPF account</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">f.    The [Wife] shall have sole conduct of the sale of the [Matrimonial Home].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband was dissatisfied and appealed against the orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets on 24 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Pool of Matrimonial Assets Not Disputed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Parties did not dispute the pool of matrimonial assets.

mortgage on the Matrimonial Home ($144,245.72) was to be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife also did not object to the Husband’s personal liabilities ($33,109.58) being satisfied from the same. The Parties however could not agree whether the same treatment was to be extended to the Wife’s substantial liabilities in her name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s Personal Liabilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     According to the Wife, she owed a total of $425,320.94 to creditor financial institutions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Wife explained that the Husband suffered a slipped disc in 2007 after carrying a heavy load during his then employment in logistics.

liabilities, the Husband did not accept the quantum stated. I found this to be a somewhat curious position to take because of the clear documentary evidence in support.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband bore the consequent evidential burden to rebut the evidence put forward by the Wife, but the Husband had no evidence to the contrary. In light of this absence, I accepted the Wife’s case that she had personal liabilities of $375,012.17 as at the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For completeness, I refer to the Husband’s specific line of defence that his medical treatment was covered by insurance. This defence was used to address whether liabilities were in fact incurred by the Wife. I found that this line of defence did not assist the Husband in light of the clear document evidence tendered in the Wife’s supplementary affidavit of 21 February 2024 confirming the extent of her liabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Whether the Wife’s Personal Liabilities are to be Deducted from the Pool of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband took the position that the Wife’s personal liabilities should not be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets. No reasons or submissions were advanced in support of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As articulated by Choo Han Teck J in <em>WNR v WNQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30472-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 43</a> (“<em>WNR v WNQ</em>”), affirming the observations in <em>WAS v WAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27228-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 7</a>, the key issue is whether the spouse’s debts are proven to have existed as at the Interim Judgment date. If so, the spouse’s liabilities should rightly be accounted for when calculating the net matrimonial assets available for division. Further, there was no allegation whatsoever that the liabilities were incurred inappropriately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was therefore unsustainable in light of the observations in <em>WNR v WNQ</em>.

relative to the opposing party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be 60:40 in his favour. The Husband broadly relied on the following in support: (a) various indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister, (b) the Husband’s monthly contributions towards the family’s household expenses (<em>i.e. $</em>50.00 for household items and $1,300.00 towards the then family vehicle), (c) <em>ad hoc</em> past payments he made towards the family (<em>i.e.</em> purchase of an air conditioner and a laptop), and (d) various acts he had done in the past (<em>i.e.</em> ferrying the children to engagements and medical appointments).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be either 70:30 or 80:20 in her favour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Wife argued that she was the primary caregiver of the children and that the Husband was an absent father as he was totally involved in his drinking. The Wife additionally argued that she was the sole provider for the family and the household expenses were borne by her. To this end, she had to deplete her savings to ease the family expenses and took loans to pay for the Husband’s medical expenses following his injury. The Wife also alleged that the Husband was financially irresponsible and engaged in a cavalier attitude where he spent much time drinking outside with his friends after work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I adopted a broad-brush approach as articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>USB v USA</em> at [43] – [46] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions. Having considered the evidence and submissions in this case, I set the indirect contributions ratio as 60:40 in favour of the Wife given her relatively higher indirect financial and non-financial contributions. There were four material points that I considered when arriving at this finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     First, I gave no credit to the Husband for the various alleged indirect financial and non-financial contributions by the Husband’s family. Assuming that these contributions did in fact occur, the Husband failed to show that these contributions were the result or product of his own personal efforts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I did not take into account the Wife’s personal liabilities that will be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, towards her indirect contributions. To do so would be double counting her efforts. If it had not been deducted, I would have agreed with the high indirect contributions ratio that she submitted in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Third, I accepted the Wife’s case that she was the primary caregiver and I accept that she provided for a substantial portion of the family expenses following the Husband’s injury. Based on the Husband’s own evidence, he was generally unemployed between 2009 and 2012, with intermittent employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The overall relatively lower levels of the Husband’s CPF accounts were also consistent with the Wife earning a significantly higher relative income between the Parties over the years. Additionally, and ironically, the Husband’s own submissions on indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister disclosed the lack of such contributions emanating from his own personal efforts. Similarly, the Husband’s submissions on his personal contributions, if assumed to be accurate, also revealed his relative lack of involvement and efforts. When considered holistically, the Husband submissions validated the Wife’s arguments that she should be credited with a higher ratio of indirect contributions <em>between the Parties</em>. For completeness and to avoid doubt, I did not accept that the Wife’s submissions that she was the <em>sole</em> provider for the family as I accepted that the Husband provided <em>some</em> contributions such as the purchase and maintenance of the then family vehicle and made some minor contributions towards the family expenses over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, I rejected the Husband’s case that his insurance payouts would have covered all related contingencies and expenses arising from his injury. He provided no evidence whatsoever and he bore the burden of proof. Be that as it may, it could not be disputed that the Wife was in debt and the Husband was unemployed for a material period. This resulted in him minimally contributing towards the family’s finances, and the Wife having to make up for the lack of family income. Further, there was no evidence whatsoever that the loans that the Wife took was inappropriately incurred. When the facts and circumstances were considered as a whole and on a balance of probabilities, I accepted that the loans taken and serviced by the Wife prior to Interim Judgment were for the family expenses, which included the Husband’s medical treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     When the above-mentioned circumstances were considered, I was of the view that an indirect contributions ratio leaning in favour of the Wife amounting to 60:40 was merited. It could not however amount to the high ratio submitted by the Wife because a significant amount of her personal liabilities would be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, and it would not also reflect the various indirect contributions made by the Husband over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Concluding the issue of indirect contributions, I wish to observe that taking the Husband’s case as its highest, I found his submissions on indirect contributions to be unreasonable and without basis. The points made in support showed no objectivity as to why they would merit a ratio that is relatively higher in his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Step 3 – Overall Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The average ratio of direct and indirect contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets was consequently <b>63.82:36.18</b> in the Wife’s favour.

SUM 1631/2024 (“SUM 1631”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1632/2024 (“SUM 1632”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This is my decision in respect of SUM 1631 and SUM 1632.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1631</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife sought disclosure of the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Statement of Accounts for the Husband’s sole proprietorship (&quot;GC&quot;), for the years 2020 to 2023 (including but not limited to the profit and loss account and balance sheet); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Documents evidencing the estimated valuation of GC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Li, cited, in both oral, and written submissions, Rule 25 of the Matrimonial Proceedings Rules.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> As I pointed out to Mr Li during the hearing, this was clearly wrong. It was the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) that applied to this set of proceedings. That much is made clear by Rule 2 of the FJR 2014 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Application</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, these Rules apply to all proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court, the Family Courts and the Youth Courts, whether such proceedings are commenced before, on or after 1 January 2015, in so far as the matters to which these Rules relate are within the jurisdiction of those Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Insofar as discovery in the context of ancillary relief was concerned, this is governed by Rules 63 – 68 of the FJR 2014. In particular, Rule 63 states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">63.—(1)    Subject to paragraphs (7) and (9) and rule 73, the Court may, at any time, on the application of any party to an action or matter (called in this rule the applicant), make an order requiring any other party (called in this rule the respondent) to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application, or any class of documents so specified or described —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Upon making an order under paragraph (1), if a document or class of documents is stated by the respondent in his affidavit to be in his possession, custody or power, the Court may order the party to exhibit a copy or copies of the document or class of documents in the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    An application for an order under this rule must be in the relevant Form, and be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the party from whom discovery is sought under this rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, custody or power, the document or class of documents specified or described in the application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the document falls within one of the following descriptions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(i) a document on which the party relies or will rely;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(ii) a document which could —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(A)    adversely affect his own case;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(B)    adversely affect another party’s case; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(C)    support another party’s case;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   a document which may lead the party seeking discovery of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information which may —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(A)    adversely affect his own case;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(B)    adversely affect another party’s case; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(C)    support another party’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Before an application under paragraph (1) may be filed, the applicant must serve a written request on the respondent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    seeking discovery of the said document or class of documents, in the relevant Form;

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    which document or class of documents he is not willing or not able to provide discovery of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the document or class of documents which the respondent is willing to provide discovery of under paragraph (5)(a) must be provided or made available, as the case may be, within 28 days after the service of the written request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    No application under paragraph (1) may be made unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the time specified in paragraph (5) to serve the notice has elapsed, and the respondent has not served such notice;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the time specified in paragraph (6) to provide or make available the document or class of documents that the respondent has notified he is willing to provide discovery of has elapsed, and he has not provided or made available such document or class of documents; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the respondent has notified that he is not willing or not able to provide discovery of the document or class of documents specified in the written request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(8)    In deciding whether to grant an order under paragraph (1), the Court must take into account —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the extent of discovery which the respondent has stated that he is willing to provide under paragraph (5)(a); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any offer made by the respondent to give particulars or make admissions relating to any matter in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(9)    An order under paragraph (1) must not be made in respect of any party before the granting of the interim judgment, or before the Affidavit of Assets and Means has been filed by the plaintiff and the defendant, unless, in the opinion of the Court —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the order is necessary to prevent the disposal of a party’s assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the order is made in conjunction with an order preventing the disposal of a party’s assets; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    there is any other exceptional circumstance necessitating the making of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In the context of orders for discovery, the twin principles of relevance and necessity are also important and apply in the present case: <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> citing <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9];

Mr Li argued that these documents were relevant and necessary to determining the issue of the division of matrimonial assets, as well as maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The thrust of Mr Li’s arguments was that these documents were needed to place a value on GC. In that vein, Mr Li cited the cases of <em>ULH v ULI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21690-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 39</a> (“<em>ULH</em>”) at [23] – [25] and <em>UPU v UPV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22378-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 99</a> (“<em>UPU</em>”) at [25] to illustrate the point that assets belonging to a spouse’s sole proprietorship could be included in the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Mr Li also made the point that every sole proprietorship had to prepare a statement of accounts for the purposes of filing taxes – this meant that there was a basis to order discovery as the statements sought did, in fact, exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In response, counsel for the Husband, Ms Helena Amolak (“Ms Amolak”) explained that her client took the view that the documents sought were not relevant, and in any event, the Husband did not have the formal statement of accounts for GC or any documents evidencing the valuation of GC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Ms Amolak also explained that GC was merely a consultancy services business, and so there was no place of business because the Husband would work remotely from home. The business also had no equipment and no machinery. There were therefore no assets belonging to the sole proprietorship that could be valued. In any event, Ms Amolak also argued that discovery should not be ordered as the accounts of GC contained business-sensitive information relating to the Husband’s clients.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     These documents are, in my judgment, clearly relevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters claim. As illustrated by the cases of <em>ULH</em> and <em>UPU</em>, the value of assets under a sole proprietorship belonging to a spouse is a relevant consideration when it comes to ascertaining and dividing the matrimonial pool of assets. I would also add that the statement of accounts would shed some light on the Husband’s earning capacity – this would have a direct bearing on the issue of maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For completeness, I deal with the point that the Husband had made: that disclosure should not be ordered because the documents which he did have were internal records, and those contained “business-sensitive” information relating to his clients.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not think that this was a bar to ordering discovery in the present case. It was not open to the Husband to attempt to side-step his obligation to provide disclosure with the mere assertion that the documents sought contained “business-sensitive” information. If there is indeed any confidential information contained within the documents that are to be disclosed, it was open to the Husband to provide redacted copies, or to request that he be allowed to redact any sensitive client information from those documents. In any event, safeguards exist (in the form of the <em>Riddick</em> principle) to prevent the misuse of documents which have been disclosed in an action under compulsion: see <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> at [30] citing <em>Third Eye Capital Corp v Pretty View Shipping SA and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31294-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 96</a> (see also <em>Marcel v Commissioner of Police</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/69130-E-M.xml')\">[1992] 1 Ch. 225</a> at p 237).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1631 is therefore allowed for the reasons I have stated above. If the Husband is unable to produce these documents, he must provide an explanation in his affidavit, together with any supporting documents. To account for the Husband’s concerns over disclosing any business-sensitive information, I allow the Husband to redact, from the documents that are disclosed, information relating to client particulars. The Husband is also given liberty to apply to redact any additional information. In doing so, he must state, on affidavit, what additional information he seeks to redact, and the prejudice which would be suffered if redaction is not allowed (see <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> at [34] – [35]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1632</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband sought the following documents in discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Bank statements for the POSB account ending XX-7 for the past 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ms Amolak argued that the bank statements were relevant to the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance. She further explained that SUM 1632 had been taken out because the Wife had yet to provide these documents which could easily be downloaded from the online banking portal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, Mr Li stated that his client was not resisting the application for discovery. He explained, at the hearing, that the Wife had been informed by the bank that it would cost $1080 to obtain the bank statements for the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Mr Li also urged me to “rule more creatively”, in a manner that would be in line with therapeutic justice (“TJ”) and save parties’ time and costs, by either ordering the disclosure of quarterly statements, or ordering that the cost of obtaining the statements be split between both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will allow the Husband’s request in SUM 1632. The Wife is to disclose the bank statements for the POSB account ending XX-7 for the period January 2021 – January 2024. There can be no dispute as to the relevance and necessity of these bank statements. It is indeed useful and relevant for the court to have sight of the Wife’s financial affairs in the period before the filing of the divorce, and after the divorce had been filed (<em>Tan Bing Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]). In the present case, the Statement of Particulars discloses, at paragraph 1(d), that the marriage had broken down as early as November 2018. The Husband had eventually filed for divorce on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of March 2023. The period of disclosure which I have ordered would provide both the court, as well as the Husband, an insight into the Wife’s finances following the breakdown of the marriage and in the months leading up to, and after the divorce had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Insofar as Mr Li had suggested that I should rule creatively in a manner that was in line with TJ, he did not go further to flesh out this point and explain how ordering the disclosure of quarterly statements or that the costs of discovery be split between the parties would accord with the principles of TJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I could not, in any event, accept this argument. One cannot simply quote TJ, without any reference to the applicable rules and principles that form part of our family law and expect to persuade the court to grant an order in terms of the prayers sought. The notion and practice of TJ must necessarily operate within the confines of existing legal principles. As the court in <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> had stated at [28]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28     <b>The notion of therapeutic justice operates within the framework of the law and does not prevail over the law</b>. Judges apply the law and legal principles in a system that is non-adversarial and conducive to problem-solving. Our family law is rich in legal principles and jurisprudence that promote therapeutic outcomes, and all legal actors in the family justice system would do well to apply the law to achieve therapeutic justice for our families.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In that vein, it is clear that the costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery. The court can, in the exercise of its inherent powers under Rules 958 and 959 of the FJR 2014, order the party entitled to discovery to “bear a whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such order for the giving of discovery”: Family Justice Courts Practice Directions para 81(35) and (36); Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at p 945.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I saw no reason, in the present case, to depart from the starting position that the party giving discovery is to bear the costs of doing so. For one, the Wife had not exhibited, in her affidavit, any evidence that she was unable to download digital copies of the bank statements free of charge. The Wife had also failed to exhibit, in her affidavit, evidence that she would have to pay $1080 to obtain these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     That being said, while the Wife has not produced evidence before me to show that it would cost $1080 to obtain the bank statements, there was equally no evidence before me to show that the Wife would <b><em>not</em></b> incur such costs in obtaining the bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Given this set of circumstances, I might have been inclined to provide for a situation where the Wife did indeed incur disproportionate costs in obtaining the bank statements. However, because no arguments as to whether I should make such an order were advanced, either at the hearing before me, or in the course of written submissions, I decline to make such orders in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I would, however, observe that in a future case, it may well be open to the party giving discovery to seek liberty to apply for an order that the party entitled to discovery is to bear the entirety, or a portion of the costs that may be incurred in complying with the order for discovery. In doing so, that party must articulate their legal and factual basis for seeking such an order. Naturally, in deciding whether it is appropriate to make such an order, the court will consider all the relevant circumstances. This could include factors such as the quantum of such costs that had been incurred or were likely to be incurred, and whether there was any reasonable way to avoid incurring such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I therefore make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>SUM 1631</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in SUM 1631, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is granted leave to redact, from the documents that are disclosed, information relating to client particulars.

In the years that followed, they welcomed two sons into their family. During this time, however, cracks were forming in their relationship. Matters reached a point of no return where the Husband filed for divorce on 17 November 2022. Interim judgment was obtained on 14 December 2023, and parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife has now taken out an application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1739/2024 (“SUM 1739”) and SUM 1684/2024 (“SUM 1684”) respectively. I heard parties on 24 June 2024 and now give my decision in respect of both summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery (SUM 1739)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife sought disclosure of bank statements, specifically of the following bank accounts in the Husband’s name:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     OCBC 360 account ending -XX1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     OCBC Easisave account ending -XX1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     POSB Passbook savings account ending -XX-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The period of disclosure sought was from September 2021 – September 2022 (<em>ie</em>, a year prior to the commence of divorce proceedings). The Wife argued, in written submissions, that disclosure was relevant and necessary to establishing whether the Husband had indeed been dissipating matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the course of oral hearings, counsel for the Wife, Mr Muhammad Hasif Bin Abdul Aziz (“Mr Hasif”), and counsel for the Husband, Mr Alain Abraham Johns (“Mr Johns”) crossed swords on whether the facts of <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> were similar to the present case such that discovery should be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I would observe that in the context of discovery applications, the decision whether to allow disclosure, while guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity, is necessarily a decision that must turn on the facts of the case at hand, taking into account all relevant circumstances. To that end, precedent is useful only insofar as they lay down guiding principles and provide an illustration as to how those principles are applied. Attempts at analogising or distinguishing precedent by close reference to the facts are, therefore, of limited utility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       While I have said that close attention must be paid to the facts of the present case in deciding whether discovery should be ordered, one must also be careful not to stray into the realm of matters that can only be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. I make mention of this because at times, it appeared to me that both Mr Hasif, as well as Mr Johns, were trying to establish whether the Husband had indeed dissipated assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In my judgment, the documents which the Wife sought was indeed relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters. It is useful for the court, as well as the Wife, to have a picture of the Husband’s financial circumstances in the period shortly before the divorce was filed: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [25] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Furthermore, having perused the various affidavits filed, it was clear to me that one issue in dispute was whether the Husband had dissipated assets which should rightfully be accounted for in the matrimonial pool of assets. The statements which the Wife sought would clearly show if there were any unusual transactions in the months leading up to the filing of the divorce. Without these statements, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish whether the Husband had indeed disposed of assets prior to his filing of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As a final point, I add that I could not agree with the Husband’s argument that the Wife’s application for discovery should be dismissed for procedural irregularity because he was never served with a request for the documents in the form stipulated by the Family Court Practice Directions (see Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This is because, in her first Request for Discovery dated 6 March 2024,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> the Wife had indeed sought monthly bank statements for all bank accounts in the Husband’s name for December 2021 to November 2022. I do note, however, that the period of disclosure which the Wife seeks in SUM 1739 appears to be different from that set out in her first Request for Discovery. I will therefore only order that the Husband disclose the bank statements for the period December 2021 to November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Subject to this slight change in the period of disclosure which I have ordered, the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1739 is allowed for the reasons I have set out above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Interrogatories (SUM 1684)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to consider the Wife’s request for interrogatories. Parties do not dispute that in deciding whether to order the Husband to answer the interrogatories posed, I must consider the relevance and necessity of the interrogatories. In addition, I must also consider whether the Husband had, in his Notice-in-Response to the Wife’s Request for Interrogatories, provided sufficient answers to the interrogatories (see <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [28] – [30]). Indeed, parties had, during the hearing, summarised the crux of their dispute over whether the interrogatories should be ordered, as focussing on the sufficiency of the answers which the Husband had provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I start with Item 1. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    I aver that the Plaintiff had bought one Rolex watch sometime during parties’ trip to Switzerland on October 2018, which is during the marriage (the “Rolex Watch”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    The Plaintiff is to provide the value of the Rolex Watch?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This was the same interrogatory which the Wife had posed in her Further Request for Interrogatories dated 7 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband had provided a response in a letter dated 28 May 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">i.    Yes. The trip was sometime in April 2018. The Plaintiff used pre-marriage assets to purchase the Rolex watch.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">ii.    The value of the Rolex Watch is about SGD18,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I am satisfied that this is a sufficient answer to the interrogatory that had been posed. It is clear that the Husband had answered the question. If the Wife has any quarrel with the <em>truth</em> of the Husband’s answers, she must take that up at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I would go further to add that it was also clear to me that this interrogatory was not necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters. I arrive at this conclusion having considered the interrogatories which the Wife had posed in her first Request for Interrogatories:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2a.    Does the Plaintiff has a watch collection? If the answer is yes, what is the total value of the watch collection?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This was the Husband’s response in the letter from his lawyers dated 11 April 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff owns 3 Rolex watches with a total value of about $40,000. These watches were purchased before the marriage and are pre-marriage assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In short, the Wife had already asked the Husband whether he did have a watch collection, and if so, the value of that collection. The Husband had given a sufficient answer. He disclosed that he owned three Rolex watches worth $40,000. Taking this into account, it was quite clear that Item 1 was not necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 1 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn now to Item 2. This interrogatory related to certain insurance policies which the Husband had with [Y]. The Wife wanted the Husband to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Explain why these policies were “no longer valid”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Provide the amounts received when these policies were “no longer valid”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     State the accounts to which these amounts had been disbursed to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     This was the Husband’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">i.    The Plaintiff was unable to afford the high premiums of Policy No. XXXXX177 and the Plaintiff had surrendered Policy No. XXXXX944 as he required funds to pay for personal and business expenses. This was stated at S/No. 3 in the Plaintiff’s Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 11 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">ii.    The screenshots from the Plaintiff’s [Y] Insurance Account show that Policy No. XXXXX177 and XXXXX944 are no longer valid, as they no longer appear. Please refer to Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 16 February 2024 at pages 54 to 57.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iii.  As stated at paragraph 2 e.iv. of NIRI, the amount received from the surrender of Policy No. XXXXX944 was $668,031.17. There was no surrender value for Policy No. XXXXX177 as the Plaintiff was unable to make payment of the high premiums and accordingly, the policy had lapsed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iv.    As stated at paragraph 2 e.iv. of NIRI, the amount was received into the Plaintiff’s POSB No. XXX-XXXXX-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am satisfied that this is a sufficient answer. The Husband had clearly explained why he had to give up both policies. He had also stated the sums received from surrendering these policies, as well as the bank accounts into which the proceeds had been deposited. If the Wife believes that the Husband’s answer is untrue, the proper place to ventilate this is before the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 2 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I come now to Item 3. It was a rather lengthy interrogatory comprising several parts. In essence, the Wife wanted the Husband to explain and provide details of several transactions. The Wife also queried the Husband on his business expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the outset, I observe that the Wife had also asked, in her request for interrogatories, that the Husband produce various documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">b.    Based on the NIRI, the Plaintiff seems to allege that he paid $445,000.00 ($150,000.00 + $150,000.00 + $20,000.00 + $10,000.00 + $20,000.00 + $40,000.00 + $5,000.00 + $50,000.00) in legal fees. The Plaintiff is to provide the documents to show that the Plaintiff has paid $445,000.00 to his divorce lawyers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">c.    With reference to paragraph 2.d.ii. of the NIRI,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">i.    The Plaintiff is to provide the full particulars and withdrawal documents for the investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">ii.    The Plaintiff is to provide the particulars of the payments for the new matrimonial home and renovations? The Plaintiff is to provide the documentary evidence for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">iii.   The Plaintiff is to provide the details of what happened to the amounts that were not used for the payment to the new matrimonial home and / or renovations? The Plaintiff is to provide the documentary evidence for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife had also, in her written submissions, argued that documents should be disclosed as part of any orders made in relation to interrogatories:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10.    Further and specifically to S/N 2 and 3 of the Interrogatories, the Wife highlights and reiterates (with reference to <em>VTQ v VTR</em>) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    It would be in the Husband’s interest to provide full and frank disclosure of relevant documents as this would help dispel any notion or suspicion that he might have dissipated or concealed matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given this request for documents (see above at [25]), at the hearing, Mr Johns raised an objection on the grounds of legal privilege. He argued that the invoices might be “impacted by solicitor-client privilege” and the Husband should therefore not be ordered to disclose those invoices. Mr Johns, however, took the position that legal privilege was not a bar to ordering that the Husband answer the interrogatories in the event that his answer was found to be insufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Leaving aside the question of legal privilege, I do not allow the Wife’s corresponding request for the disclosure of these documents simply because she had not asked for these documents in her application for discovery in SUM 1739. As the court in <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9] (see also <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21]) had made clear, there is a difference between discovery and interrogatories. A request for discovery cannot be smuggled in under the cover of an application for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As for the sufficiency of the Husband’s answers in response to Item 3, having read those, it was clear to me that he had replied to every part of the interrogatory which had been posed, and provided ample details. The Wife may well dispute the <em>truth</em> of these answers, but in my judgment, the Wife can have no quarrel with the <em>sufficiency</em> of these answers (see <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [27] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, I note that the Husband had, in response to the Wife’s interrogatory on his business expenses, disclosed a business agreement. That agreement set out the sums which the Husband claims to have incurred, and was, in my view, a sufficient answer to the interrogatory which had been posed. While I have noted above (at [28]) that a party may not, in their request for interrogatories, demand that the other party disclose documents, I would take the tentative view that a party who is responding to an interrogatory can disclose a document as their answer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 3 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I turn now to Item 4. This Item contained interrogatories pertaining to the Husband’s income. The Wife sought details as to the lump sum payments which the Husband had or would receive from his work in April and May 2024 (Item 4a), as well as whether he had won any awards (Item 4b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In relation to the lump sum payments, this interrogatory had been posed in the Wife’s request dated 6 March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She had asked whether the Husband would be receiving a lump sum bonus to the tune of $80,000 to $100,000 for work done in April/May 2024. This was the Husband’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iv.    In relation to Interrogatory 6(d), the numbers should be accurately reflected in the income statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     This was, in my judgment, not a sufficient answer. The Husband had not directly answered the question. He provided no confirmation as to whether he would indeed be receiving a lump sum bonus, or the quantum of such a bonus.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the interrogatory relating to whether the Husband had won any awards at work, he had not provided an answer. The Wife argued that this interrogatory was relevant and necessary to assessing the Husband’s financial capacity and income ability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     This interrogatory was, in my judgment, not necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. The Husband had already disclosed his IRAS statements for the years 2021 – 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was no need for the Wife to establish the Husband’s “financial capacity and income ability”, by this rather roundabout means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I will therefore order that the Husband answer the interrogatory that had been framed in Item 4a. The Wife’s request in respect of Item 4b is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out at paragraph 8 of the Wife’s affidavit filed in support of SUM 1739 for the period December 2021 to November 2022, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall answer, on affidavit, the following interrogatory to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With reference to paragraph 2.f.iv. of the NIRI, whether the Plaintiff has and / or will receive lump sum payments in April and May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband’s compliance affidavits are to be filed by 2 August 2024. As for costs, parties are to write in with their submissions, which shall be no longer than 3 pages each, by way of letter. This is to be done no later than 22 July. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To avoid doubt, nothing I have said in this judgment shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Hasif and Mr Johns for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife did file a request, but the request was not set out in the form as dictated by the Practice Directions.

I relieved the husband of his obligation to maintain the wife forthwith but declined to vary his obligation to maintain the child. The husband is dissatisfied with these decisions. I now provide my grounds for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The spouses married in 2014 and divorced in 2018. They had a child in 2015. During the divorce, they agreed that the husband would provide monthly maintenance of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child. The total sum of $1,500 was to be paid to the wife on the first calendar day of each month. This agreement was recorded in an interim judgment, FC/IJ 3930/2018, which was made final in FC/FJ 5140/2018 (the “Consent Judgment”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The husband fell behind on these maintenance payments. In June 2020, the wife filed a Maintenance Summons, MSS 1613/2020, to enforce the arrears that had accrued. This summons was determined in October 2020 through a consent order, EMO 1054/2020. Thereunder, the husband acknowledged that the arrears totalled $37,500 and agreed to pay them in instalments of $500 per month. This consent order also clarified that the monthly maintenance payments of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child would continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The husband again fell behind on his payments of the arrears under EMO 1054/2020 and of the ongoing maintenance under the Consent Judgment. In December 2021, the wife filed another Maintenance Summons, MSS 2680/2021, to enforce these arrears. This summons was determined in April 2022 through an adjudicated order of enforcement, EMO 284/2022. Therein, the court found that the arrears totalled $60,500 and ordered the husband to pay them in instalments of $1,000 per month. This order also confirmed that the monthly maintenance payments of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child would continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In May 2023, the wife filed a third Maintenance Summons, MSS 1097/2023. Therein, she alleged that the husband had once again fallen behind on the payments of the arrears under EMO 284/2022 and of the ongoing maintenance under the Consent Judgment. According to the wife, these arrears totalled $63,000 as of May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In August 2023, the husband commenced these proceedings to vary his obligations to maintain the wife and the child under the Consent Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband sought to be relieved of his obligations in the Consent Judgment to maintain the wife in the monthly sum of $300 and the child in the monthly sum of $1,200. He asked that this relief be back-dated to “a date to be determined by the Court”. He deposed that he had agreed to these sums during the divorce because “the [wife] wanted it and I gave in to her request”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and even though he would struggle to pay them. He claimed that he had entered into the Consent Judgment because he had been “psychologically troubled” and “depressed” during the divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Further, during the divorce proceedings, I was psychologically troubled and felt depressed. I had failed to make sound choices and did not address my difficulties in making monthly maintenance payments due to my state of mind. I was also unrepresented then and felt pressured by everything was that ongoing. These factors contributed to me agreeing to the maintenance sums ordered in the [Consent Judgment].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue estoppel </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the outset, the orders of enforcement of arrears of maintenance in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 (see [3] and [4] above) complicated the attempts by the husband to vary his maintenance obligations with retrospective or back-dated effect. In making these orders of enforcement, the court had determined the accrued arrears and the quantum of arrears that were due from the husband (insofar as cause had been shown as to why any other part of the arrears should not be enforced under r 116(9) of the Family Justice Rules 2014). These determinations crystallised the quantum of arrears as of the time when the order of enforcement was made. Unless these determinations were disturbed, whether on appeal or otherwise, they were final and conclusive judgments on the merits that created issue estoppel between the spouses (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0157.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157</a> at [14]–[15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This issue estoppel, which was part of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, produced at least two consequences in subsequent proceedings between the spouses to vary orders of maintenance (including orders for the maintenance of children of the marriage). First, it prevented the spouses from challenging the quantum of arrears that were due at the time of the order of enforcement. Second, and by implication, it prevented the spouses from challenging the reasonableness of the substantive orders of maintenance that underlay those arrears as of the time of the order of enforcement. Further, this issue estoppel applied even if the earlier determinations had been erroneous because of the private and public interests protected by the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> (see Sundaresh Menon CJ, “Transnational Relitigation and the Doctrine of Transnational Issue Estoppel”, paper delivered at the 8th Judicial Seminar on Commercial Litigation (14 March 2024) at paras 15–16). The private interest lay in the right of the spouses to be free from vexation by re-litigation of the issue of maintenance in respect of the same timeframe, which freedom enabled them to move on from the divorce, to heal, and to re-cast their futures. The public interest lay in upholding the integrity of the court process by securing the end of litigation that conduced to the efficient adjudication of disputes and that protected the authority of the judicial decisions from unceasing challenges.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     That said, issue estoppel was subject to a qualification known as the “<em>Arnold</em> exception” (see <em>Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/69027-E-M.xml')\">[1991] 2 AC 93</a>). This <em>Arnold</em> exception enabled a litigant to, in exceptional cases, reopen an issue that had been previously determined. Nevertheless, stringent conditions governed the application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception. To invoke it, five conditions had to be met: (a) that the prior decision directly affected the future determination of the parties’ rights; (b) that the prior decision had been clearly wrong; (c) that the error in the prior decision had arisen because a point was not taken before the court that made the decision, and the point could not reasonably have been so taken; (d) that any rights accruing under the prior decision would not be clawed back, and any effects of the prior decision would not be undone; and (e) great injustice would arise were issue estoppel to apply (see <em>The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18226-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 1104</a> at [103] and [139]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As between the spouses in these proceedings, the quantum of arrears of maintenance for the wife and for the child had been determined in October 2020 (in EMO 1054/2020) and again in April 2022 (in EMO 284/2022). These determinations were final and conclusive judgments on the merits. Hence, and unless the husband could avail himself of the <em>Arnold</em> exception, issue estoppel applied in these proceedings to preclude him from challenging the quantum of arrears and the necessity of the substantive orders of maintenance that underlay those arrears as of October 2020 and April 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The husband claimed that the wife had been in a “stable financial position even during the Covid period when [he] was jobless and suffered an income loss”. He added that she did not need further support because her monthly income was $4,000 while his monthly income was only $3,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I agreed with the husband that the wife had sufficient earning capacity to maintain herself and that it was no longer necessary for him to maintain her. The wife confirmed that her monthly income ranged between $2,780 and $4,500 depending on overtime, commissions, and bonuses. She also deposed that the monthly sum of $300 in maintenance for her under the Consent Judgment was to her a “token” amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As the Family Court had repeatedly observed, “a spousal maintenance order is not to be regarded as a meal ticket for life and should not be intended to create life-long dependency by an ex-wife on the ex-husband” (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>UHK v UHL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29612-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 12</a> (“<em>UHK</em>”) at [39] and <em>VOX v VOY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25643-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 11</a> at [38]). Here, the marriage lasted only four years while nearly six years had passed since the divorce. The income of the wife equipped her to support herself. It was thus justified to relieve the husband of his obligation to maintain her. As eloquently put by District Judge Kenneth Yap in <em>UHK</em>, the wife “should look towards this improvement positively, and draw satisfaction from her ability to be self-reliant and enjoy greater independence from her former husband’s support” (at [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Nevertheless, I did not rescind the wife maintenance with retrospective or back-dated effect. The husband initially prayed that the recission should be “backdated to a date to be determined by the Court”. He later deposed that he sought a recission from the date of these proceedings, <em>ie</em>, August 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Given the relatively short period of time between August 2023 and the conclusion of these proceedings in April 2024, most of which time was spent on mediation, I did not find such a back-dating of the rescission necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I noted that the husband also sought to “set aside any arrears of [wife] maintenance” that had accrued. In my view, this was a request that had to be made to the court hearing the pending application to enforce the arrears of maintenance, MSS 1097/2023 (see [5] above). In any event, the bulk of these arrears had accrued between the divorce in August 2018 and EMO 284/2022 in April 2022. These arrears had been determined and crystallised in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 (see [3] and [4] above). Issue estoppel to prevent the re-litigation of these arrears in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance of child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The husband began by complaining that he had not been granted access to the child and thus knew little about the life and expenses of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He then claimed that the monthly expenses of the child had fallen below $1,200 since the making of the Consent Judgment, and referred to the tables that had been exhibited in MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021 (the “Expense Tables”) in support of this claim.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He added that he was in any event unable to pay the arrears of maintenance that had accrued since the Consent Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I did not agree with the husband that the maintenance for the child should be reduced or rescinded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The complaints of the husband about his access to the child were not germane to his obligation to maintain the child. Issues about the access of a parent to a child were analytically distinct from issues about the obligation of that parent to maintain the child. Still, directions for the husband to exercise access to the child had since been made in related proceedings (see Summons No 2376 of 2023), and those directions appeared to have assuaged the concerns of the husband about his access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The claim by the husband that the expenses of the child had fallen below $1,200 after the Consent Judgment was based on the Expense Tables. The Expense Tables reflected the expenses of the child as of June 2020 and December 2021, when MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021 respectively were filed. Yet those proceedings concluded in orders of enforcement that recorded the monthly arrears of maintenance at $1,500, including $1,200 for the child, as of October 2020 and April 2022 (see EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022). The quantum of child maintenance for which the husband was liable as of October 2020 and April 2022 had thus been determined to be $1,200. Further, issue estoppel precluded the husband from challenging that determination, regardless of whether it had been erroneous, unless the <em>Arnold</em> exception applied. And it was unclear how the <em>Arnold</em> exception could apply when the Expense Tables had been exhibited in MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021, in which this determination had been made. Despite these Expense Tables, the husband <em>consented</em> to EMO 1054/2020 and did not challenge EMO 284/2022. It was no longer open to him to rely on the Expense Tables or to dispute his liability as of October 2020 and April 2022 to maintain the child in the monthly sum of $1,200. This constraint arose because of the public interest in upholding the integrity of the court process by securing the end of litigation (see <em>Kho Jabing v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19124-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1273</a> at [2])) and operated regardless of whether such an objection had been taken by the wife in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In consequence of this issue estoppel, I was constrained to consider only the circumstances after October 2020 and April 2022 for the purpose of this application to vary the obligation of the husband to maintain the child. On the evidence before me, the monthly income of the husband had been $3,000 since November 2021 and had remained “stable” thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Similarly, there had been little change in the monthly expenses of the husband, the wife, and the child since April 2022. Specifically, the husband adduced no evidence on the monthly expenses of the child after April 2022, and the wife deposed that those expenses amounted to $1,476.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> There was thus no material change of circumstances to justify a variation of the obligation of the husband to maintain the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Ultimately, the issue estoppel that flowed from EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 meant that the only circumstances that were relevant in these proceedings were those after April 2022. During this period, there had been little change in the earning capacity of the husband or in the expenses of the child. Even if the Expense Tables could have shown that the expenses of the child had decreased, it would have been unjust to have recourse to them. The husband had, by his consent to EMO 1054/2020 and his non-challenge of EMO 284/2022, forewent his right to rely on the Expense Tables and or to dispute his liability to maintain the child in the monthly sum of $1,200 as of April 2022. Insofar as the determinations in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 on the quantum of the arrears and the liability of the husband to maintain the child had been erroneous, the husband had ample opportunity to challenge them. Yet the husband did not avail himself of that opportunity. As a result, the public and private interests protected by issue estoppel and the wider doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> constrained me to proceed on those determinations in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     For these reasons, I relieved the husband of his obligation to maintain the wife but not of his obligation to maintain the child. This order was to take effect forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I made no order on the costs of this application.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 37.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 43.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit at para 91.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-07-11","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2741 of 2020 (Summons No 1298 of 2024)","title":"WYV v WYW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 47","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31733-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Sarah-Mae Thomas and Larissa Mira Balmadres (Sarah-Mae Thomas LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYV v WYW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYV <em>v</em> WYW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31733-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 47</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2741 of 2020 (Summons No 1298 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">11 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Sarah-Mae Thomas and Larissa Mira Balmadres (Sarah-Mae Thomas LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYV — WYW </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">11 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision in respect of costs for SUM 1298 of 2024 (“SUM 1298”). My substantive decision in respect of SUM 1298, which was the Father’s application to strike out the Mother’s application for a variation of access orders in relation to the children of their marriage, can be found in <em>WYV v WYW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31695-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 44</a> (“<em>WYV</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard parties on 11 July 2024 and made no order as to costs. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Arguments </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Father, Ms Sarah-Mae Thomas (“Ms Thomas”), argued that her client, having succeeded in his striking out application, should be entitled to costs. As to the quantum of costs, Ms Thomas submitted that it should be fixed at $4500, plus disbursements of $577.52. In calibrating the quantum of costs, Ms Thomas urged me to take into account the Mother’s conduct, specifically, that it was clear that there was no basis for taking out SUM 893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In response, the Mother argued that she did have a basis for taking out SUM 893. She explained that she could not, as a mother, sit idly by in the face of what the children had told her. The Mother urged me to, in considering whether there was a basis for taking out SUM 893, account for the fact that she was a self-represented person. The Mother also asserted that she was currently unemployed and did not have any resources to spare – while she did have a licence as a property agent, it was difficult for her to close any deals because she had to look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In response, Ms Thomas pointed out that the Mother had provided no evidence that she was in dire financial straits. What was in evidence, however, was that the Mother was renting out her HDB flat. Ms Thomas further argued that the Mother should not be allowed to escape without paying costs, especially since the Father had to engage counsel to deal with SUM 893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At this juncture, I asked Ms Thomas to address me on the case of <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”) and whether the proposition of law, that it was appropriate to make no order as to costs in a situation where parties had an acrimonious relationship, should be applied in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ms Thomas argued that the proposition in <em>JBB</em> cannot be taken as a shield for abusing the process of court. There could not be a blanket exception for every litigant who takes out a vexatious claim or tries to abuse the court process. There was bound to be acrimony in divorce cases, but her client should not be harassed by applications of this nature and the cost consequences had to reflect that. Ms Thomas also highlighted the point that insofar as the court might make no order as to costs to avoid aggravating relations between the parties with an order of costs – this was to facilitate co-parenting arrangements. However, in the present case, the co-parenting arrangements had been frustrated as Father had not been able to see his daughter for the past two years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I allowed the Mother to respond to the points which Ms Thomas had made. She stood by her assertion that finances were tight on her end, and that she had no income at all despite having a property agent licence. The Mother also further argued that the Father’s allegations of alienation had not been established.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       To this, Ms Thomas raised one final point in reply – that DJ Amy Tung (“DJ Tung”) had, in her decision for MSS 1384/2022, rescinded DJ Yong’s orders in relation to the Mother’s maintenance. Ms Thomas highlighted that DJ Tung had found that the Mother had misrepresented that she had not passed her real estate examination. In this vein, Ms Thomas characterised the Mother as a person who would misrepresent facts time and time again to the court, and urged me to assess all that the Mother had said in this light.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Mother’s reply was that she had only misrepresented the fact that she did not have a real estate licence – she did not make any misrepresentation as to the earnings she had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The principles relating to costs are summarised in <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [9]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7    Insofar as the principles governing costs are concerned, they can be found in Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. In essence, if the court does award costs, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event. The court can, however, depart from this starting point, taking into account factors such as the conduct of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8    One reason for departing from this starting point, and ordering that each party is to bear their own costs, or making no order as to costs, is to “minimise acrimony and discontent between parties” (see also <em>VJL v VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24701-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 59</a> at [135]; <em>TIJ v TIK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18469-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 147</a> at [23]). That was the point which had been made in <em>JBB</em>. There is much sense to taking such an approach. From a practical perspective, an order to pay costs may well create the potential for further discontent between parties. For instance, one party may well be tempted to, in an attempt to spite the other party, refuse to pay costs. This would spawn further applications to enforce the costs order (see <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26685-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 107</a> at [134] – [135]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9    It bears noting that what had been said in <em>JBB</em> is not a hard and fast rule – it does not mean that parties should always have to bear their own costs in matrimonial proceedings (see <em>WQR v WQS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30388-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 41</a> at [88]). Ultimately, costs are in the court’s discretion, and in certain cases, for example, where a party has acted unreasonably in the proceedings, that party may very well be ordered to bear the other party’s costs: see <em>UHG v UHH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21040-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 116</a> at [63] – [68]; <em>UTN v UTO and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23424-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 18</a> at [107]; <em>TNX v TNY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18869-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 50</a> at [51] – [60]. This may also be the case where a party has taken an adversarial stance in proceedings – an award of costs would reflect that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the present case, as I had observed in my written grounds for SUM 1298, both the Father and the Mother did have an acrimonious relationship (<em>WYV</em> at [89]), and there was a risk that the children would be triangulated into their dispute. I had also encouraged both parties to set aside their differences and to find ways to work together in the best interests of their children (<em>WYV</em> at [94]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is with this in mind that I deemed it fit to make no order as to costs. The children are at a stage of their lives where they will need the support and guidance of both their parents (<em>WYV</em> at [89]). That can hardly be achieved if both parents continue to wage war against each other in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     To avoid doubt, the time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents showing the value of assets under a trust fund","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents not yet in existence"],"date":"2024-07-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1420 of 2023 (Summons No 1269 of 2024)","title":"WZF v WZG","citation":"[2024] SGFC 46","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31712-SSP.xml","counsel":["Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","Jasmine Yan (Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WZF v WZG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZF <em>v</em> WZG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1420 of 2023 (Summons No 1269 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">05 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; Jasmine Yan (Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZF — WZG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Documents showing the value of assets under a trust fund</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Documents not yet in existence</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">5 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married on the 26<sup>th</sup> of June 2015 in Perth. Almost three years later, they welcomed their son into the family. Beneath the surface, however, cracks were forming in their relationship. The details of how the relationship between Husband and Wife had broken down are set out in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). They tell the tale of how the Husband had behaved in such an unreasonable way that the Wife could not be expected to live with him. That was the ground of divorce which the Wife relied on when she eventually filed for divorce on 27 March 2023. Interim judgment was subsequently granted on the 29<sup>th</sup> of November 2023. Parties then proceeded to exchange their voluntary requests for both discovery and interrogatories. Dissatisfied with the Husband’s response, the Wife took out SUM 1269 of 2024 (“SUM 1269”) seeking discovery in respect of 15 categories of documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard oral arguments from parties on 24 June 2024. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision in respect of SUM 1269</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The twin principles of relevance and necessity govern when discovery should be ordered: <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9]; <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>; <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a>. These principles are not in dispute in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Item 1 was a request for the statements of the Husband’s bank account with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ending - XXX) from January 2022 to November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Counsel for the Wife, Ms Looi, explained during the hearing, that the Husband had only disclosed the statements from June to November 2022 after SUM 1269 had been taken out. Ms Looi had also explained that the statements sought were for the period shortly before the breakdown of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The only response which Ms Yan had was that the Husband did not have the documents which were asked for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There can be no quarrel as to the relevance, or the necessity of the documents that the Wife seeks. It is indeed useful for the court, as well as the Wife, to have a picture of the Husband’s financial affairs in the period leading up to, and shortly after the breakdown of the marriage: <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19]. I will therefore allow the request in respect of Item 1. The Husband is to disclose these documents. If he cannot produce them, he must state his reasons, and provide the relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I turn now to address Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. These were statements of the Husband’s other bank accounts from January 2022 to the present date. Ms Looi explained that the Wife took the view that there had been no full and frank disclosure by the Husband in respect of these accounts. That was because in the Husband’s Notice in Response (“NIR”) to the Wife’s request for voluntary discovery, he had stated that there were no such accounts. However, in response to SUM 1269, the Husband had stated that these accounts had been closed. The Wife takes the position that if these accounts had indeed been closed, then the Husband should provide documentary evidence of the account closure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In response, Ms Yan said that in respect of Items 2 and 5, the bank accounts were not in existence. As for Items 3, 4, 7 and 8, the Husband had called the bank but was still unable to get the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 is allowed. If the Husband does not have these documents, he must provide an explanation together with any relevant supporting documents. He cannot sidestep his obligation to provide disclosure with the mere assertion that these documents do not exist: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75]. Finally, I add that there can be no quarrel as to the relevance and necessity of these documents – they would shed light on the Husband’s financial affairs in the period leading up to the filing of the divorce, and the period after the divorce had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As for Items 6 and 9, these too were requests for statements of the Husband’s bank accounts for the period January 2022 to January 2023, and January 2022 to February 2023 respectively. Ms Looi argued that while the Husband claimed that he had requested for the documents, he had yet to produce them, and there was no visibility as to when these documents would be produced. The Wife therefore had to seek disclosure of those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In response, Ms Yan explained that the Husband had called the bank to ask for the account statements, but he had been told that more time would be needed before the statements could be sent to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 6 and 9 is allowed. Parties did not dispute the relevance, or necessity of these documents to the ancillary matters hearing. The real dispute was when the Husband could produce these documents. As I have explained above (at [7]), if the Husband cannot produce these documents, he must provide an explanation together with any relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I come now to Items 10 and 11. These were requests for the Husband’s income tax statements in Singapore and Australia. Ms Looi argued that these documents were relevant and necessary because the Husband had only stated that he was earning $7500 per month, but he had not produced any documents evidencing his income. These documents were relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters because child maintenance was a live issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ms Yan stated that the Husband had not filed any income tax since 2020. He had, however, instructed his auditors to help prepare and file his income tax returns in Australia, but his auditors had told him that some time would be required before that could be done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 10 and 11 are allowed. The Husband’s income tax statements are indeed relevant and necessary for determining the Husband’s income. Although both Ms Yan and Ms Looi had crossed swords on whether the Husband had not filed any income tax statements for a long time, this was not a material consideration in deciding whether discovery should be ordered. The point is, and Ms Looi had alluded to this in her oral arguments, that if the Husband indeed had not filed any tax returns, there would be some evidence from the tax authorities to that effect. The Husband must therefore disclose his income tax statements. If he cannot produce them, he must explain why, and provide documentary evidence from the tax authorities in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I turn now to the Wife’s request in Item 12. The documents which the Wife sought were in respect of the Australian and Singapore corporate entities of the [A] Group of Companies (the “Companies”). She wanted the audited financial statements or unaudited profit and loss statements of the Husband’s companies for the period 2020 to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Ms Looi argued that the Husband should be able to produce these documents because he was the sole director and shareholder of the Companies. Ms Yan did not dispute this point. She explained that the Husband’s instructions were that he did not have the audited statements that the Wife had asked for, and that he was currently waiting for the auditors to prepare the statements. In any event, as Ms Yan argued, the period of disclosure should only be from 2022 to the present date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The applicable principles relating to the disclosure of company documents in discovery are set out in the High Court decision of <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery)</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194) (see also <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [41] – [44]; <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31611-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 37</a> at [23] – [26]). Given that the Husband is indeed the sole shareholder and director of the Companies,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I am satisfied that the documents sought are either within his possession, or within his power to obtain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Insofar as Ms Yan had stated that the Husband was still waiting for the statements to be prepared, this was not a bar to ordering discovery. I note that the court in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> had stated, at [64], that a “prerequisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some evidence that the document requested is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power. The standard of proof is that of a <em>prima facie</em> case”. I would go one step further and add that the court can order discovery if there is <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought will come into existence at some point in the future. This point was illustrated in <em>G v G (Financial Provision: Discovery)</em> [1992] 1 FLR 40. In that case, the husband had recently joined a firm of solicitors and the partnership deed, which the wife sought disclosure of, had yet to be drawn up. Bracewell J ruled (at p 42) that that the court’s power to order discovery was not merely limited to documents that were already in existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As for the period of disclosure, I could not agree with Ms Yan that the period of disclosure should only be from 2022 till the present date. It was, in my judgment, necessary to order a wider period of disclosure given that it had been stated, in the SOP, that the Wife had no clear picture of the Husband’s “financial ability” despite their years of marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the above reasons, I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to Item 13. The Wife was seeking documents relating to the [B] Family Trust account and documents stating the value of the trust account. Ms Looi argued that I should order disclosure because pursuant to cl 6.3 of the trust deed, the Husband could, as the sole beneficiary of the trust, obtain a valuation of the assets held by the trust. While Ms Looi acknowledged that the trust deed was governed by Australian law, she made the point that there was no need to refer to Australian law to establish the proposition that a beneficiary of a trust is entitled to ask the trustee for an account. That was because cl 6.3 had very clearly set this out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>6.3 Accounts, Records, Information and Documents</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The Trustee will keep complete and accurate records of all receipts and expenditures on account of the Trust Fund</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Promptly after the close of each Accounting Period, the Trustee will prepare a written accounting report (prepared in accordance with the accounting practices and standards generally accepted in Australia) for that Accounting Period consisting of a:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    Statement of income and expenditure; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    List of assets and liabilities at the close of that Accounting Period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Without prejudice to any right of the Trustee to refuse disclosure of any document, the Trustee will not be bound to disclose to any person:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    A document disclosing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(A)    the deliberations of the Trustee as to the manner in which the Trustee should exercise a power vested in, or discretion conferred on, the Trustee by this Deed; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(B)    the reasons for a particular exercise of or failure or refusal to exercise, a power or discretion by the Trustee, or the material upon which those reasons were or might have been based; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Any other document relating to the exercise or proposed exercise of a power or discretion conferred by the Trustee (not being legal advice obtained by the Trustee as an expense of the Trust Fund).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response, Ms Yan stated that the Husband’s position was that he had disclosed the trust deed and that there were no other documents in his possession. Insofar as the Husband could, pursuant to the trust deed, request for the documents, some time would be needed for those documents to be prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 13. Documents disclosing the value of the assets held on trust were certainly relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters, specifically, the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets. For completeness, I note that cl 6.3 did not expressly state that the Husband could, as the sole beneficiary, ask for documents disclosing the value of assets held on trust for him. All that cl 6.3 stated was that the Trustee would prepare written accounting reports. There was <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents which the Wife was seeking did exist. Given that the Husband did not dispute that he <em>could</em> obtain these documents, I did not see the need to interrogate whether the Husband had, pursuant to Australian law, the power to ask for those documents as the sole beneficiary of the trust.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I turn now to the penultimate item on the list: Item 14. This was a request for the Husband to disclose documents evidencing the current surrender value of an endowment fund which the Husband had taken out for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The real dispute in relation to Item 14 was when the Husband could disclose the documents sought. Ms Looi explained that the Wife wanted clarity as to when the Husband could provide the documents. Ms Yan, on the other hand, pointed to an email sent by the Husband, showing that he had put in a request for the documents, but was currently awaiting a response.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     There was no dispute between parties as to the relevance or necessity of the documents sought. Rather, the quarrel was as to when these documents could be produced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 14. If the Husband cannot produce these documents, he must provide an explanation in his compliance affidavit, together with any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I come now to Item 15. This was a request for the Husband to disclose the Husband’s superannuation account in Australia. Ms Looi argued that because these documents could be easily obtained online, it was difficult to accept the Husband’s explanations as to the delays in obtaining those documents. The Wife thus took the view that the Husband was attempting to evade her request for those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Ms Yan stated that the Husband’s instructions were that he was currently waiting for his advisor to provide him with the necessary documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 15 is allowed. There can be no dispute as to the relevance and necessity of these documents to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I therefore order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in Items 1 – 15 of the Schedule annexed to SUM 1269, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband’s compliance affidavit is to be filed and served by 7 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for costs of SUM 1269, Ms Looi argued that the Husband should pay costs to the Wife, fixed at $2500 (all in). In response, Ms Yan argued that it was the Wife who should have to pay costs to the Husband, though she made no argument as to the quantum of costs payable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I fix costs at $2400 (all in), to be paid by the Husband to the Wife within 14 days of this judgment. In doing so, I take into account the fact that the Wife has obtained orders for discovery in respect of all the items which she had prayed for in SUM 1269, as well as the fact that the matter was not particularly complex.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Looi and Ms Yan for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 1269 at p 35 and pp 40 – 41.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 1(o).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1269 at pp 20 – 21.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2546 of 2023 (Summons No 1346 of 2024)","title":"WYX v WYY","citation":"[2024] SGFC 45","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31691-SSP.xml","counsel":["Sabrina Wong Xue Yun (SC Wong Law Chambers) for the plaintiff","Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan (Murthy & Co) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYX v WYY</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYX <em>v</em> WYY </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2546 of 2023 (Summons No 1346 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sabrina Wong Xue Yun (SC Wong Law Chambers) for the plaintiff; Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan (Murthy &amp; Co) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYX — WYY </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SUM 1346 of 2024 (“SUM 1346”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. I heard oral arguments on 24 June 2024. At that hearing, counsel for the Wife, Mr Thirumurthy, confirmed that his client was not seeking discovery in respect of all the items set out in the list annexed to SUM 1346. Instead, she was seeking discovery in respect of the following documents as had been set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 of her supporting affidavit for SUM 1346:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Passport details and copies of the Husband’s travel history to other countries for the years 2021, 2022 and up to November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Payslips for the years 2020, 2021, 2022 up to November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This was procedurally irregular. None of these documents which the Wife was seeking had been prayed for in SUM 1346. Mr Thirumurthy explained that there was no prejudice to the Husband because he had, in a letter dated 6 May 2024, informed the Husband’s lawyer, Ms Sabrina Wong (“Ms Wong”) that he would be pursuing discovery in respect of these two items. Although Ms Wong confirmed that she was aware of this request, she raised the objection that SUM 1346 was indeed procedurally irregular as the two items which the Wife sought had not been prayed for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that Ms Wong was prepared and able to deal with the Wife’s request, I proceeded to deal with the Wife’s request on the merits, notwithstanding this procedural irregularity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Insofar as discovery is concerned, Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">63.—(1)    Subject to paragraphs (7) and (9) and rule 73, the Court may, at any time, on the application of any party to an action or matter (called in this rule the applicant), make an order requiring any other party (called in this rule the respondent) to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application, or any class of documents so specified or described —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power;

<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>; <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a>. These principles are not in dispute in the present case. Parties, however, dispute that I should order discovery in respect of the two categories of documents which the Wife has sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In relation to the travel documents (above at [1(a)]), Mr Thirumurthy explained that these issues were directly relevant to the issue of child maintenance. This was because the Husband had, apparently, only offered to pay $400 per month in child maintenance. Mr Thirumurthy explained that if the Husband could travel, he could well afford to pay a higher amount of maintenance for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In response, Ms Wong argued that the travel documents were irrelevant to the issue of child maintenance. She argued that, as a matter of law, the quantum of child maintenance was to be determined by what the needs of the child were. The frequency of the Husband’s travels should have no bearing on the quantum of maintenance for the child. In any event, this was, according to Ms Wong, a fishing expedition because the Wife had only asked for the travel documents at the first round of voluntary disclosures and not the second.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While Ms Wong is right in that child maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, the quantum of child maintenance is something to be assessed having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case. Parties are expected to show how their projected expenditure for the child’s expenses is reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances including the child’s standard of living <b>and the parents’ financial means and resources</b>: <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) at [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       That being said, I did not see how the records of the Husband’s travels were relevant to showing his financial means and resources. At best, these records would show the number of countries which the Husband had been to, and the duration of each trip. It would not show how much the Husband had actually spent on each trip. For instance, as I pointed out to Mr Thirumurthy during the hearing, the travel records would not show whether the Husband had flown in first class, or by budget airline.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In any event, it appeared to me that the Wife may have had <em>other</em> reasons for seeking disclosure of the Husband’s travel documents. In her counterclaim re-dated 19 October 2023, she had, at para 2(j), said that the Husband would disappear from the matrimonial home on Sundays and Public Holidays. She had eventually discovered that on these occasions, the Husband had travelled to Malaysia and other countries on his own. The Wife suspected that the Husband had “sexual associations” with females whenever he went on these trips, although the Husband had, when confronted, denied it. The Wife’s request for the Husband’s travel documents, when read in light of what she had set out in her counterclaim, suggests that she may well have had a collateral purpose, which were unrelated to the hearing of the ancillary matters, for seeking those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Therefore, for the reasons which I have set out above, I disallow the Wife’s request as set out above at [1(a)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request for the Husband’s payslips (above at [1(b)]). Again, as Mr Thirumurthy had explained, the Wife wanted the payslips to show that the Husband was actually able to afford more in terms of child maintenance. As the Wife had set out at paragraph 8 of her affidavit in support, she wanted the payslips to show that the Husband was being reimbursed for internet and telephone bills. These payslips were also, as Mr Thirumurthy had explained, relevant to showing the Husband’s income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In response, Ms Wong once again argued that the Wife was on a fishing expedition. The Husband’s IRAS statements had already been disclosed. The Wife was thus well aware of the Husband’s salary. Even if the payslips were required to show the amount of reimbursements, the extent of disclosure sought had to be circumscribed by the amount in dispute. Disclosure of the payslips should therefore not be ordered given that the reimbursements came in at about $230 each month. Ms Wong had also pointed out that the Wife had not asked for the Husband’s payslips in her voluntary request for disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the arguments, I disallow the Wife’s request for the Husband’s payslips. Rule 63(4) and 63(7) make it clear that before a summons for discovery can be taken out, the documents which are sought must first be asked for during the voluntary disclosure process. In the present case, it is clear that the Wife had not asked for the Husband’s payslips in both her first,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and second requests for discovery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was therefore not open to her to now seek discovery in respect of those documents in SUM 1346.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In any event, the payslips were, in my judgment, not necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters. For one, the Husband had already disclosed his income tax statements. Those statements would clearly allow his income and means to be assessed. Insofar as the Wife had claimed that she wanted the payslips to show that the Husband could clearly pay more as a matter of child maintenance, our jurisprudence makes it clear that parties should, in seeking to quantify what are a child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an “overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure”: <em>WBU</em> at [10]. It was therefore not necessary for the Wife to have the Husband’s payslips in order to propose a suitable figure in respect of the quantum of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1346 is therefore dismissed. Parties are to file their written submissions on costs by 12 July 2024, limited to a maximum of 3 pages each. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Wong and Mr Thirumurthy for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1346 dated 13 May 2024 at p 23 – 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1346 dated 13 May 2024 at p 149.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)","title":"WYA v WYB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 43","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31690-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff","Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYA v WYB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYA <em>v</em> WYB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31690-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 43</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff; Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYA — WYB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on costs in respect of SUM 1063, which was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories. My written grounds in respect of the Wife’s application can be found in <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31611-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 37</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that because she had substantially succeeded in her application, the Husband should have to pay her costs fixed at $3500 (including disbursements of $570).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband, on the other hand, argued that there should be no order as to costs. Two reasons are given. First, that both parties were equally successful in SUM 1063.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Second, that such an order is necessary to minimise “the acrimony and discontent” between the parties. In this vein, counsel for the Husband asserts that there is a significant degree of acrimony between the parties, and that parties have a strained relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> There has, however, been no reference to specific examples of such acrimonious behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The principles relating to costs are well-established and not disputed in the present case. The starting point is that costs shall follow the event, though the court can depart from this, taking into account factors such as the conduct of parties: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> citing Rule 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I order that costs be fixed at $1350 (all-in). I consider this to be an appropriate sum taking into account the complexity of this application, that it was heard in a half-day slot, as well as the fact that the Wife had only partly, and not substantially, succeeded in her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As a final point, I add that I could not agree with the argument made by counsel for the Husband, that there should be no order as to costs because there was a significant degree of acrimony between the parties who both had a strained relationship. This appeared to be a mere assertion. Counsel had not referred to any specific instances which evidenced such a significant degree of acrimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having perused the various affidavits and pleadings, I was hard pressed to find instances of such conduct. In this vein, I add that it would be useful for counsel to, if they are taking the position that no order to costs should be made to avoid aggravating relations between the parties, to point to specific instances demonstrating the bad blood between the parties. This could include, amongst other things, applications for personal protection orders, or communications between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I conclude with one final observation. I do not think that the proposition of law laid down in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>, can or should be used as a pretext to avoid having pay costs to the other party who has succeeded in their application. In other words, I did not think it is open to a party to simply assert, without more, that relations were acrimonious and so there should be no order as to costs. While one may expect a certain degree of acrimony in divorce proceedings given that it represents the end of a life once shared in love and joy, not every party to a divorce will react badly. Some may find, within themselves, an inner strength to move on. Others may also be able to see past their hurt, and even remain on talking terms with their former spouse. On the other end of the spectrum, however, are those who find themselves unable to let go of past hurts. It is in such situations, where it is clear to the court that there is indeed acrimony between the parties, that it might be appropriate to make no order as to costs. Such matters are, however, an assessment the court must make in the exercise of its discretion as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions on Costs at paras 3 and 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at para 8.</p></div></content></root>"}]
