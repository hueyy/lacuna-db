They are largely non-verbal and need help with daily living. The offspring of the mother, (“M”), a South African national and the Father, (“F”), a French national working in Singapore since 2015, the twins presently reside in France with the M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In 2018, while the family was still residing in Singapore, the M obtained a maintenance order (“MO”) in favour of the twins. The MO provided for a monthly maintenance sum of $1,600 in total for both children. In addition, the F was to bear all school related expenses as well as a sum of $1,500 as accommodation/rental expenses. Eventually, the M would move to France with the twins shortly after the MO was issued while the F remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In February 2024, the M filed for enforcement of the said MO <em>vide</em> MSS 454/2024, alleging to have received only one payment thereunder, and sought to enforce arrears from May 2018 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       A few months later in July 2024, the F applied for variation of the MO to ‘zero’, <em>vide</em> MSS 1672/2024 and for the variation to be backdated to 2018 when the children started living in France as they were enjoying government benefits which presumably exceeded their needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Eventually I found that the M was entitled to arrears of <b>$105,600</b> from 2020 onwards. As for the F’s application, I ordered that he pay a reduced amount of maintenance of $1,091 from July 2025 onwards and rejected his request for backdated variation to 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       These grounds of decision set out the court’s views on how social welfare benefits may be considered in the context of applications for enforcement and variation, and in particular whether they can amount to showing good cause for a payer defaulting in his maintenance obligations, and merit a reduction in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It also suggests general considerations in assessing reasonable expenses for a special needs child and seeks to elucidate the threshold of the legal burden on respondents in enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The names of the children in these grounds of decision are pseudonyms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties had resided in Singapore from 2015 onwards when the F’s work brought him here from France. Unfortunately, parties’ relationship broke down. In 2018, when the twins, Madeline and Antonio were three years old, the M applied for maintenance and obtained the MO on 6 April 2018. A few days later on 11 April 2018, parties entered into a consent order in an application launched by the F under the Guardianship of Infants Act (“the OSG orders”). Under the latter, parties had joint custody of the twins, and the M was allowed to relocate to France with the children while the F would be allowed to visit them annually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Shortly after the OSG orders were granted, the M went to Cameroon to work and the children were cared for by her mother. Here and there, she got some financial support from her family members as the F did not send her maintenance. In the enforcement proceedings, the F would explain he had refused to do so as his payments into the designated bank account stated in the MO had bounced in September 2018, and he did not trust the alternative bank account number the M later personally furnished him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The twins were only diagnosed with autism sometime in 2019-2020. As the health authorities in Cameroon were unable to care for the twins, the M moved to France where the children could receive the necessary interventions and social welfare benefits. In the meantime, her request to the F to pay the maintenance into her French bank account was ignored. Between seeking government assistance for early intervention for the children and searching for appropriate school placements, the M would state that claiming maintenance arrears from the F was not her top priority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In 2020, the M informed the F via Whatsapp that the children had severe special needs that required intervention. Her message was, according to the F, a bolt from the blue. In his own words<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[35]  Eventually, I received a Whatsapp message from [the M] saying that she had relocated to France with the children and that I should continue transferring the monies to a new bank account in France. I did not adhere to this as this was not what was in the said order. I was also not sure whose [account] this was as [the M] was only informing me about the account at that time. Following this, [the M] stopped communicating with me and she refused to give me details about her and the children’s whereabouts and deprived me from accessing or communicating with the children once again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[36]  Then suddenly in 2020, when the children were about 5 years old, [the M] sent me many photographs of the children and was sharing with me contacts from their school in France. I contacted the school shared by [the M] and a specialist in the school informed me that both the children, Madeline and Antonio were exhibiting verbal autism, with serious developmental delays. I was devastated upon receiving the said information and it made me wonder what [the M]’s intention was, for her to get the school to share this information with me at this point in time. <b>I was emotionally drained and eventually, I stopped communicating with [the M] and blocked her on Whatsapp and I was also trying to focus on my life and my employment here in Singapore.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<b>37</b>]   <b>Since then she did not communicate with me nor update me about the children. For the reasons as set out in the narrative above, I did not contact her and she did not contact me and we just proceeded with life.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     This appeared to be the general state of affairs between parties until the M filed for enforcement. The F then appointed a registered French lawyer practising in a firm in Singapore, who attempted negotiations with the M to no avail. The said counsel then rendered an expert opinion on the benefits the M was potentially receiving in France. Suffice to say, parties were unable to resolve both applications out of court and both matters were fixed for hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The court’s findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter apply and if so, were there special circumstances?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     A preliminary issue was whether the M was entitled to enforce more than three years’ worth of maintenance given the restriction under section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit <b>unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Women’s Charter (“Charter”) does not specify what qualifies as “special circumstances” under section 121(3). Generally, these are circumstances which are sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would do great injustice to the party receiving maintenance (see <em>Koay Guat Kooi (mw) v Eddie Yeo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6511-M.xml')\">[1997] SGHC 197</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The purpose of the time bar is to ensure that a respondent is not blindsided by a sudden and large amount of arrears that might cause hardship to him. This however, must be balanced against the hardship the applicant suffers if the time bar were to apply, and the principle that a respondent should not be permitted to profit from his/her own wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I find that there were special circumstances in the present case. Taking care of a pair of young, non-verbal autistic twins on her own while also desperately seeking intervention for them, it was understandable that enforcing maintenance was not the M’s priority. This is especially given the opportunity cost of having to fly to Singapore or appointing Singapore lawyer(s) to take out the necessary legal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     That said, I only allowed the M to claim unpaid maintenance from 2020 onwards. I accepted that there had been poor to almost no communication between the parties and insofar as the F’s reason for defaulting was because he was unaware of the children’s whereabouts, by 2020 it would have been patently clear to him that the children were residing in France when the M messaged him over Whatsapp and shared with him a list of specialists in Singapore he could reach out to in order to secure intervention for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     From January 2020 till June 2025 (the month of the hearings), this was a period of 66 months. The arrears for this period came up to $105,600 based on the fixed monthly maintenance of $1,600. I disallowed the M’s claim for arrears in relation to the children’s therapy and related expenses as I agreed with counsel for the F, Mr Dodwell, that these fell outside the scope of the MO as they did not appear to be required by the children’s school. The court can only enforce what an order provides for. Arrears for accommodation expenses were also excluded from enforcement at the M’s request – she candidly pointed out that her accommodation was being paid for by the French government.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has the F ‘shown good cause’ for failing to pay maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established the quantum of arrears that was enforceable under section 71 of the Charter, the next inquiry was whether the F had furnished good reasons at law, for failing to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">To ‘show cause’ and ‘show good cause’</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Section 71 enforcement proceedings are commonly known as ‘show cause’ proceedings. In <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [10], it was held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is the opportunity that is made available to the Respondent to “show cause” (which is the term found in the summons that is served on Respondents generally…)…or in simple language, “show reason” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full…or in part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, P.3, r.15(3) provides that if the enforcement court intends to impose a sentence of imprisonment for arrears owing as of the time of the enforcement application, the court must, before imposing the sentence of imprisonment, require the respondent’s personal attendance in court and -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    give the respondent the opportunity –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the respondent has made the payment or payments required to be made under a maintenance order; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   to <b>show cause</b> for the respondent’s failure to make the payment or payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></em>, the learned author observes that the expression “show cause”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… does not imply that a mere opportunity of submitting an explanation is enough. It implies that adequate opportunity of leading evidence in support of the contentions raised against his [<em>sic</em>] must be given and where necessary, opportunity of cross-examining witness of the other side and of addressing arguments be afforded. <em>Shyamlal v State of UP</em> AIR 1954 All 235 at 234.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     From the above definitions of ‘show cause’, it can be gleaned that it is an important <em>procedure</em> where a respondent explains his/her default and to that end, the respondent is to be allowed to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     That the term ‘show cause’ in the context of maintenance enforcement proceedings has historically been used in subsidiary legislation rather than primary legislation, may give rise to the perception that ‘show cause’ is primarily a matter of procedure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     But ‘show cause’ also has a substantive dimension to it, which is that the respondent’s explanation must persuade the court that there was good reason for his/her conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     This requirement for the explanation to satisfy the court is rather implicit and it may not be readily apparent to parties in enforcement proceedings what the content of the burden to ‘show cause’ consists of. Indeed, if the casual excuses respondents in enforcement proceedings often give are any indication, some exposition on the content of this obligation could be helpful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the case of <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a>, the court listed some examples where the court found that a respondent had shown cause, and I gratefully reproduce [21] of the judgment here:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg.,<em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg.<em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is not difficult to appreciate in the scenarios outlined above why the court found that the respondent had shown good reasons for not paying maintenance. Less intuitive for respondents though, is why the court refuses to accept a lack of a respondent’s access to his/her child, or a respondent’s unilateral deduction from the fixed maintenance sum expenses which the respondent incurred for the child on his/her own volition (and without the care and control parent’s consent or knowledge), as amounting to ‘showing cause’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Why do such reasons not amount to ‘showing cause’? It is this court’s view that how enforcement proceedings have proceeded in the courts thus far is for the respondent to show ‘<em>good</em> cause’ that would excuse his default in paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The term ‘good cause’ appears in section 72 of the Charter, which sets out the threshold for the rescission and variation of a maintenance order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay monthly sums under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, <b>or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</b>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Section 91O of the recently amended Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> also requires a respondent to “show good cause” as to why he defaulted on his maintenance obligations under a show payment order, failing which, the default term of imprisonment takes effect:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">91O.—(1)    Where a court has specified a term of imprisonment under section 81(2)(d) or (4)(a)(ii) in respect of a respondent, the court may sentence the respondent to imprisonment if —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the respondent fails to prove to the satisfaction of the court, by any date specified under section 81(2)(c) or (4)(a)(i) in respect of an amount to be paid, that the respondent has paid that amount by the date specified in the order under section 81(2)(b) or (4)(a)(i)(A) (as the case may be) for payment of that amount; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the court is satisfied that the respondent has shown no good cause for his or her failure mentioned in paragraph (a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     While not defined in the Charter, ‘good cause’ is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (12<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2014)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A legally sufficient reason. <b>Good cause is often the burden placed on a litigant (usu. by court rule or order) to show why a request should be granted or an action excused</b>…Also termed good cause shown; just cause; lawful cause; sufficient cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is: “Reason which is found to be adequate or proper and justified by a court or a competent authority dealing with the matter.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002 ed) defines ‘good cause’ as: “a cause or reason sufficient in law, or that is based on equity or justice or that would motivate a reasonable man under all the circumstances.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     If ‘good cause’ is required before a maintenance order can be varied or rescinded, and to avoid imprisonment for breaching a show payment order, then it seems only logical that the same threshold be imposed when there has been a default in maintenance. Indeed, the intrinsic importance of maintenance demands as such. It is not enough for a respondent to simply “show reason” – he/she must “show good reason” that satisfies the Court. As Sachs LJ put in <em>Jones v Jones</em> [1970] 3 All ER 47 at 55:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…‘good cause’ …is a phrased adopted by Lord Denning MR both in Baker v Bowkett’s Cakes Ltd [1966] 2 All ER 290…’[g]ood reason’ is a phrase used by Lord Goddard in Battersby v Anglo-American Oil Co Ltd [1944] 2 All ER 387; [1945] KB 23. For my part, I would prefer that <b>no gloss be put on these two phrases, which have a precisely similar meaning.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     A respondent in enforcement proceedings needs to proffer good reasons that are established at law or founded in equity, buttressed by sufficient and cogent evidence, as to why he or she should be excused from the default in maintenance. This is the burden of proof the respondent bears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Whereas the traditional term of ‘show cause’ may appear to litigants to refer primarily to the procedure of allowing a respondent to provide an explanation for his default and to challenge opposing arguments and evidence made against him, the phrase ‘show good cause’ renders it expressly clear that the respondent also produces legally sufficient reasons for his request in order that his conduct is excused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     So while an enforcement application may often be referred to as a ‘show cause’ proceeding, it is this Court’s view that the burden is really for a respondent to ‘show good cause’. This is consistent with the prevailing practice in the Family Justice Courts and aligns with the burden of proof in the Charter for variation proceedings, and a respondent explaining his default under a show payment order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s reasons for defaulting on the maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The F in his affidavit spoke of how the M had not given him access to the twins and how he was unable to see the children despite having joint custody of them. I found that even if this were true, it was irrelevant. A child’s basic needs require no articulation – it is a matter of common sense that a child needs food, shelter, clothing and education provided for them because they are unable to provide for themselves. As the High Court in <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a> remarked at [48]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A parent ought to be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     While the Court’s remarks above were in the context of an application for a maintenance order, the same reasoning applies equally in enforcement proceedings. Every child needs to be maintained regardless of whether there is an order in force, and whether the parent has access to the child. Such is the duty of a parent enshrined under section 68 of the Charter – it exists independently of an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Where a maintenance order has been made, it is expected to be complied with regardless of a parent’s subjective feelings. It is worth iterating that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All court orders must be complied with. A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(at [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22373-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 15</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The F’s alleged lack of access even if it were proven, was irrelevant to the F’s liability to pay. It was not a reason that can be sustained at law or equity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For completeness, I add that if the F genuinely had concerns over access, it was always open to him to take out proceedings in Singapore where he is based, or in France, for access to the children. After all, he appeared to have easy access to French counsel and affordability of counsel was not an issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     It appeared that the F’s alleged difficulties with access was a smokescreen - he simply did not want to maintain the twins. This as much was clear when he stated that he blocked the M when she reached out to him in 2020 about the children’s condition. Instead, he “just wanted to focus on his life in Singapore (see [12] above).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     It is this court’s view that the F had wilfully shut his eyes towards the needs of his children and his maintenance obligations under the MO. He appeared to have accepted that the children were living in France when he blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020, yet he refused to pay the maintenance into a French bank account which details the M had provided back in 2018. His basis for not doing so because it was a different account number from that in the MO was with respect, rich. On one hand he was expecting of the M a fastidious adherence to the MO down to a technical detail of a bank account number, yet on the other hand, he was blatantly breaching the MO by refusing to pay maintenance despite the M herself providing an alternative bank account. Clearly, he was contravening the spirit and substance of the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Another ground the F had relied on to preclude enforcement, was that the children were being maintained in France and receiving generous benefits from the government. The M was receiving the following benefits based on her own evidence:</p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col

id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The children’s school fees, medical, dental and insurance were free, due to the children’s condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In view of the foregoing, the F submitted that the MO not be enforced against him, especially since it had been made in the context of Singapore’s standard of living as reflected in the judge’s brief grounds of decision when it issued the MO. Mr Dodwell stated in his submissions, “the order was contextually and geographically specific, reflecting the financial demands of raising children in Singapore without state support.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The F submitted that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the relocation of the Mother and children to France combined with their access to comprehensive, ongoing, and state-funded support under the French social welfare system renders the continued enforcement of [the MO] unnecessary, unjustified, and inequitable. The French government, through the Caisse d’Allocations Familiales (“CAF”), provides a robust system of family-related welfare benefits, including monthly cash transfers and subsidies covering housing, education, childcare, and healthcare.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The family’s eligibility for these entitlements is directly linked to the Father’s nationality and status. As a result, the Mother and children receive substantial and regular public financial assistance that directly meets the essential needs for which [the MO] was originally intended.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my view, the above reasoning was <em>ex post facto</em>. When the F ceased to pay maintenance, he was unaware of the specific benefits the children and the M were receiving. He simply was not interested in maintaining the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Would the M be “profiting” if the MO was enforced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     But leaving aside the F’s subjective basis for not paying maintenance, objectively speaking, should the fact that the French government was financially supporting the children during the period of default amount to good cause for not paying the maintenance? Would the fact that the children had received government benefits since 2020 mean that the M will be receiving a windfall or profiting somewhat should the MO be enforced against the F, a point alluded to in the F’s submissions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     There are three considerations at play in this context. The first is that court orders are to be adhered to unless and until varied or discharged by law. In <em>Madison Pacific Trust Limited and ors v PT Dewata Wibawa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24926-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 184</a> at [73] the High Court cited Mark S W Hoyle, <em>Freezing and Search Orders </em>(Informa, 4th Ed, 2006) at para 9.17 (cited with approval in <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0518.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518</a> at [82]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is no defence to contempt proceedings to allege that the order should not have been made, or has been discharged. <b>An order of the court must be obeyed while it stands</b>, and a breach is still contempt even if, at a later stage, the order is in fact discharged. <b>The same principle applies if the original order was wrongly made; the defendant’s remedy is to apply for its immediate discharge while keeping to its terms.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Court orders are to be obeyed, until varied or discharged at law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Second, the law does not assist the indolent. The F has been based in Singapore since 2018 and has had access to local lawyers. In fact, he was legally represented in the maintenance proceedings and could have easily obtained legal advice on his ongoing maintenance obligations. This he could have done as early as September 2018 when his transfers to the M’s Cameroon bank account bounced and she had furnished him her French bank account details, or in 2020, when he received the M’s Whatsapp messages of the children suffering from severe autism and being in France. The F could have then taken out an application to vary or rescind the MO to cease his maintenance obligations owing to the benefits the children were receiving from the French government. He did none of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Last but not least, it is to be emphasised that “A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order” (see [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the principles outlined above, it is my view that the M having received government benefits on behalf of the children, whether they were equal to or even exceeded her entitlement under the MO during the period of default, did not amount to good cause as to why the MO ought not to be enforced against the F. And on this note, I rejected the submission that any variation of the MO be backdated to 2018 for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For completeness, I add that I find it unlikely that the M would be “profiting” from the enforcement of the MO. She explained having to refund the French government the Family Support Allowance once the F pays up the arrears. This was also alluded to by the F’s own French lawyer, who prepared an expert opinion on the benefits the M was likely receiving in France. Therein, the said French lawyer mentioned that a recovery claim may be filed against the debtor (the missing/defaulting parent). This would not be inconsistent with the M’s claim that the government can claw back such monies from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, the M testified (and this was undisputed) how she would be out of pocket for the utilities by some 322 euros each month and additionally, how she has paid for therapeutic interventions for the children (which she has not been allowed to claim as arrears in these enforcement proceedings). Ultimately, it was apparent that the M has been out of pocket for the children’s expenses all these years, and the enforcement monies will go some way towards addressing this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders made on the enforcement application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The arrears from January 2020 to date (including June 2025) stood at $105,600. The aggregate amount appears staggering, but is only so because of the long period of default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The F’s nett pay exceeded $20,000 per month and based on his latest notice of assessment, his average monthly income was some $30,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Taking these figures into account, the long period of default, and the large amount of arrears, I ordered that the arrears be paid off in monthly instalments as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 October 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 November 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     Sum of $10,000 by 20 December 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_v\"></a>(v)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 January 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 February 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The F was ordered to show payment online for each of these payments. The remaining arrears were to be paid off in monthly instalments of $5,000 with effect from 20 March 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The variation application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ respective positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As adverted to earlier, the F had applied for the MO to be varied to ‘zero’ and such variation to be backdated to when the children started residing in France and started receiving government benefits. Mr Dodwell submitted that the “children’s welfare is adequately provided for without reliance on contributions from the Father.” Additionally, he pointed out a “financial surplus” for them as they were being maintained at a standard of living that is “comparable, if not superior, to what was envisaged when [the MO] was originally made in the context of Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Counsel also contended that there was no financial hardship demonstrated by the M in relation to the children’s upkeep. Imposing maintenance on the F would thus be “an unnecessary and duplicative financial obligation, which is inconsistent with the principles of proportionality and equity underpinning Singapore’s family law regime.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The M on the other hand stated that at the time the MO was made, the children were not yet diagnosed with autism, and that the F’s variation application was a red-herring designed to confuse. It would be unjust if the F was allowed to escape his maintenance obligations by applying for backdated variation. He also ought not to rely on the French government for the children’s maintenance when he was more than capable of supporting them as their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The M thus asked that the current clauses in the MO remain, save for the clause pertaining to accommodation as this was provided by the French government. She submitted having to pay for the children’s food, specialists, clothes, toys and holidays, and their needs can be expected to evolve as they grow up. She also has to top up 322 euros for utilities each month. She was unable to work as she needed to care for them and ferry them to their various therapies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has there been a change in circumstances or good cause to vary the maintenance order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Section 72 empowers the court to vary a maintenance where there has been a change in circumstances or good cause to do so. There was indeed a change in circumstances, given that at the time the MO was made, the children were undiagnosed and parties were residing in Singapore with the judge stating that her determination on the MO was “premised on the children remaining in Singapore and incurring expenses in Singapore.” Now that the M is residing in France and receiving benefits, this also amounts to a change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The F’s objections to the children’s expenses </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Some of the twins’ needs were disputed by the F as seen

desire for the children. In particular, it was the various therapies and intervention that the F objected to, because he had not been consulted and there was no proof that these were medically necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">‘Reasonable maintenance’– an objective-subjective approach and its application to ‘special needs’ children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In assessing reasonable maintenance for a child, the court is largely concerned with the reasonableness of the nature and quantum of such expenses (<em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a>). This is largely an objective exercise, but concurrently one that requires a value judgment of the court as to what is reasonable against all the circumstances of the case. Hence, the High Court observed at [47]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Suppose, hypothetically, the mother of a child does not consult the father about enrolling the child in horseback-riding classes that cost $1,500 a month. The father is of the view that their family of five, with a monthly household income of $9,000, cannot afford such an expense, and such expenses are in any case not the more common ones such as those arising from academic tuition classes or music and swimming enrichment classes. If the father refuses to pay for the horseback-riding classes, can he be said to have refused to provide reasonable maintenance? Another hypothetical example is where a mother purchases a car for their 19-year-old child and requests the father to pay for the car, being the child’s “transport expenses”. Some disagreement or resistance to less common and reasonable expenses is not inevitably a refusal to provide maintenance. <b>Naturally, this assessment of reasonableness is dependent on all the facts and circumstances of the case including the standard of living enjoyed by the child and the family.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     There is thus in my view, an objective-subjective approach that the court adopts when assessing what <em>type</em> of expense is reasonable for a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Likewise, with the quantum of expenses, there is similarly an objective-subjective approach. Hence, the court does not require receipts to assess what a reasonable quantum for groceries would be for an average Singaporean household – the universal, shared experience or knowledge of how much bread, milk costs etcetera is needed by an average family and how it is necessary for daily living – means that receipts are not strictly required:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. ([13] of <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     However, where the family in question enjoys a higher standard of living than the average Singaporean family, then for the same type of expense, it can be contemplated that a higher quantum may be reasonable to align with or approximate towards the family’s standard of living, insofar as this is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. There is thus the element of subjectivity that still hews to the requirement of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Hence, where more extraordinary expenses are concerned, these should be proven. Even so, the court may find that while such expenses are being incurred, they do not necessarily fall within the ambit of reasonableness. In <em>WLE v WLE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a>, the High Court remarked at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The fact that an item of expenditure has been paid for does not necessarily mean that it is a reasonable expense for which maintenance must be ordered under the Charter: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [9]. Moreover, these payments were made post-divorce and the decision to incur this expenditure is, in my opinion, a unilateral decision of the Husband based on his parenting style. The law does not hold back the Husband from indulging the daughter, but it also cannot compel the Wife to contribute to such indulgence. In the unfortunate breakdown of a family, the question of maintenance is limited Version No 2: 05 Apr 2023 (17:15 hrs) <em>WLE v WLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a> 15 to a test of reasonableness. Accordingly, the court will only order divorcing parties to pay what is reasonable for the child, and no more. The reasonable expenses of the daughter, as calculated, is $1,941.67 but I will round it to $2,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In the present case, the children’s expenses were certainly not run-of-the mill. The F submitted that the intervention and therapy were not proven to be medically necessary and hence he ought not to pay on them (aside from the fact that he was not consulted).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     While indeed there were no reports produced by the M stating the medical necessity of these interventions, what was available however, were reports speaking of the twins benefitting from such therapy and intervention and the positive progress they had made. The F did not challenge the veracity of such reports nor produce any expert report rebutting the utility of such intervention and therapy for the twins.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The High Court at [67] of <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> observed, a care and control parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...is in a far better position than [the access parent] to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The F’s objection grounded on the lack of consultation would have held more sway had he not chosen to deliberately distance himself from the children. Indeed, it appeared that he was determinedly uninvolved in the children’s lives since the consent order in the OSG proceedings was entered into on 10 April 2018 where it had merely provided that the F, a France national, “shall endeavour to visit [the children in France] on an <em>annual</em> basis and have reasonable access” to them. During the proceedings, it emerged that it was the M who had insisted on this clause to ensure he could be involved in the children’s lives. Yet, there was no evidence in the proceedings or rebuttal of the M’s account, that the F had never carried out this thin obligation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Further, no response was forthcoming from the F when the M wrote him a letter seeking specialist intervention for the twins and furnishing him the contact details of various specialists in Singapore; he had also blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020 to focus on his life in Singapore despite his claim that he was heartbroken upon hearing their diagnosis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The F’s actions – and inaction – made it patently clear that he wanted nothing to do with the twins. In my view, his deliberate failure to exercise his custodial rights means he cannot now rely on those same rights to insist on being consulted on the children’s therapy and intervention before he is made to pay on them. While this Court will not go so far as to suggest there is an estoppel by conduct, it is hard to see how the ends of justice would be served if the M, the sole caregiver of special needs twins, was to be penalised for giving up on engaging the F.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Pertinently, for the F to now raise objections to the children’s therapy, means that if such objections are allowed, the M will have to alter the children’s routines and lifestyles after having single-handedly raised them for the last seven years, devoid of the F’s input. This would indubitably be detrimental to the children’s interests, especially when they have made progress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     All this said, it would be desirable for the F to consider playing a more active role in the children’s lives as he remains their father and the children can only benefit from his care and concern of them. If he had been an absent father before, he can choose to be an active one today which the M stressed she was always desirous of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     Where special needs children are concerned, it is this Court’s view that the element of subjectivity may necessarily have to be take on a broader role while still being subject to the touchstone of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     There is no universal definition of ‘special needs’, though the OCED (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) has described this as “…a term used in many education systems to characterise the broad array of needs of students who are affected by disabilities or disorders that affect their learning and development. There is a wide range of policy responses to provide support to students with special education needs.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Indeed, with special needs children, their needs can be varied and multifarious, particularly in terms of the intervention and therapies required. In assessing what is reasonable for a special needs child, it is this Court’s view that the Court can accord <em>greater latitude</em> to the care and control parent in deciding the type of care and therapy the child receives because <em>generally</em>, it will be the care and control parent who is most uniquely placed to understand the child’s needs. This already is the general position (see [77] above) and must apply with greater force where special needs children are concerned, especially where they are uncommunicative or have certain dispositions which only their caregiver understands. The experience of caring for special needs children is less amenable to generalisation and there should be some leeway afforded to the care and control parent’s assessment which may have to take into account even the child’s own subjective preferences and predilections.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     How would this play out? Suppose the following hypothetical. Parties are residing in Singapore and the care and control parent seeks to secure intervention in the UK for their 8-year-old son who is autistic. Objectively speaking, the nature of the intervention and the quantum of the expenses involved would unlikely be reasonable. This is because local intervention is quite readily available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     What if however, the parties had relocated from the UK to Singapore six months ago and the child had already been undergoing intervention before the family arrived in Singapore whereupon parties’ marriage immediately broke down? The stress of the divorce proceedings has adversely impacted the child and the care and control parent strongly believes that their son needs a familiar environment. Progress in Singapore has also been much slower than in the UK. In these circumstances, the care and control parent’s claim for the expenses incurred in flying the child to the UK for intervention, does not appear <em>wholly</em> unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Of course, the court will also have to consider parties’ financial positions against the total expenses for such intervention, amongst other factors. After all, section 69(4) of the Charter provides that the court “shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In another hypothetical, what if a care and control parent seeks out an experimental therapy or intervention for a condition with no medical opinion evidence of its benefits? In this regard, the court may have to assess the reasonableness of the parent’s belief that the intervention is likely to work on the child and to this end, subjective considerations may be taken into account such as the child’s proclivities and behavioural traits. While an experimental therapy unbacked by clinical trial results may sound like claptrap to one, if a special needs child is refusing conventional therapy and the untested therapy represents a sliver of hope of successful intervention, is it wholly unreasonable to give it a try?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The assessment of what is reasonable for special needs children thus cannot be viewed through a simple, singular lens of whether a particular expense is objectively reasonable in nature or its quantum – what is <em>un</em>reasonable for an average child may be reasonable for a special needs child. For instance, it may be reasonable for a special needs child who is non-verbal or devoid of social skills to undergo animal-assisted therapy. This may not, <em>without more</em>, be reasonable for children who do not have special needs, and the court may be slow to allow for animal-assisted therapy if conventional therapy is available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     And even as there is the requirement of reasonableness, it should not be forgotten that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The paramount consideration in all proceedings involving children is the welfare of the child. This principle is the “golden thread” that runs through all proceedings directly affecting the interests of children</b>: <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> at [19]). The welfare principle ensures that the children’s interests are not side-lined while their parents litigate over their various disputes. Parental responsibility is crucial in upholding the welfare principle and is a serious<em> legal</em> obligation not to be taken lightly. (at [1] of <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     All this said, in assessing the reasonableness of the type of intervention, there must be a modicum of evidence that: (a) such intervention is required; (b) is ongoing and benefitting the child, or (c) has not yet commenced but is likely to benefit the child. Where there is little objective evidence suggesting an intervention’s utility or benefit, the Court may have to be more circumspect in allowing such expenses to be claimed, whilst being sensitive to the fact that the care and control parent is likely to have more insight into what the child requires. The absence or lack of evidence does not necessarily mean the intervention or therapy is unreasonable; its presence <em>generally</em> militates towards its reasonableness, unless the other parent can prove otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     At this juncture, it is apposite to address a frequent contention often raised by payers of maintenance, which is that the care and control parent is artificially inflating expenses. This often rears its head in maintenance, variation and sometimes, enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Certainly, it is not uncommon for expenses to be inflated and exaggerated in such proceedings. However, to cynically run such an argument in relation to therapy and intervention expenses for a special needs child, ignores the realities of raising and caring for a special needs child and is rather affronting to the care and control parent. Most such parents act in good faith; they genuinely believe in the need for intervention and are anxious for early and successful intervention. Almost always, the care and control parent also bears part of the costs of the intervention and therapy. Such intervention thus comes at a personal cost as well – there is no pecuniary gain from this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     At the same time, it is recognised that there is a wide spectrum of ‘special needs’ in terms of type and severity and one cannot discount the <em>possibility</em> of the care and control parent being overzealous in “diagnosing” or “labelling” their child. That said, an official diagnosis may take too long to obtain and the care and control parent may be acting on little more than one’s parental instincts. The parent should not be prejudiced simply for not producing an official report or memo, but each case ultimately turns on its unique facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Ultimately, the burden still rests on a parent claiming maintenance (or seeking a variation or enforcement as the case may be) to prove the reasonableness of such expenses and there is no presumption that any therapy or intervention a parent <em>unilaterally</em> decides upon is reasonable for the purpose of claiming or enforcing maintenance for a special needs child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">To what extent should state benefits be considered in assessing maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The benefits received by the M are a financial resource for the M and should be factored into the calculation of maintenance that is needed. However, I do not imagine state supported schemes or benefits to be munificent in the same way that parents themselves can be expected to be with their children. Social welfare benefits usually cater for a baseline standard of living – this is apparent from how <em>none</em> of the state benefits the children receive appear to be dedicated towards therapy or intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     If the benefits the M and the children are receiving appear to be on the high end, this underscores the severity of the children’s disabilities and the M’s predicament as a single mother who is the twins’ sole caregiver. Put another way, it is the unenviability of their situation that allows them to claim this amount of benefits, not that they are enjoying a “comparable or superior standard of living, to what was envisaged by the MO”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     Maintenance is a fundamental, parental responsibility. Government benefits, like any other financial resource (eg. savings, inheritance, donations, sponsorship), do not and should not absolve a parent altogether from paying maintenance. The Court has repeatedly iterated the “equal but differentiated responsibilities” of parents, and the fact that one parent is able to fully financially support a child does not mean that the other parent is then allowed to abdicate his/her responsibility to maintain the child – see <em>AUA v ATZ</em> [2016] 4 SLR 690 at [41] and [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[41]  Section 68 states that a parent’s duty is to provide what is “reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life”. This is buttressed by s 69(4) of the Charter, which specifically directs the court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”, including, among other things, the income and earning capacities of the wife and child in deciding what sum to order in maintenance. Undergirding these provisions is the principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: <b>both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities</b> (see <em>TIT v TIU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> at [61]). The Charter clearly contemplates that parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[45]  …the welfare of the child was best advanced if both parents played an active role in the upbringing of the child, even if they might not continue to live together. We affirm this principle and we hold that it applies with equal force to the area of material provision<b>. Even if one parent were fully capable of providing for the child’s material needs, it would still be in the best interests of the child, and consistent with the scheme of the Charter as a whole, that the law recognises and enforces the joint responsibility of both parents to maintain the child. This is I keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities</b>…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Court is not the child’s parent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Neither is any government. To suggest that the government is fully supporting a child and hence maintenance need not be paid, makes a mockery of one’s parental duty and responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Eventual variation of the maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    Given that it was only after the making of the MO that the children were diagnosed with autism, the order ought to be varied such that their special needs can be catered for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The children’s basic living expenses are provided for by the government benefits. The therapy and interventions are the main source of divergence in parties’ estimates. After factoring in the state benefits the M was receiving, the M had a deficit of 738.18 euros according to her estimates, while the F’s estimates yielded a surplus of 1060.56 euros.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    In the present case, it was evident that the therapy the children had been attending was benefitting them. Given the circumstances of the case and how they had been raised by the M single-handedly, I saw no reason to vary the maintenance order to ‘zero’, which would effectively exclude the therapy and intervention expenses, finding that to do so would be inimical to the twin’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Instead, the sum of $1,600 in the MO should be replaced with the sum of $1,091 in total for both children – this is the equivalent of 738.18 euros based on the exchange rate stated on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website as of 18 June 2025 ($1.4776 to 1 euro). This was to take effect from 25 July 2025 onwards. By addressing this deficit through a reduced sum of maintenance, this ensures that the children’s needs are not compromised whilst at the same time sufficiently taking into consideration the benefits the children are already receiving. I had considered the high-income earning capacity of the F and the children’s standard of living which was adverted to by the judge who issued the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I further varied the order to provide for a clause that allows for therapy/intervention options not covered under the MO or by insurance, to be discussed between parties. This was to promote the F’s right as a joint custodial parent. The M readily agreed to such a clause and this was welcomed by Mr Dodwell as well. The F would not be liable to pay on such expenses if he was not consulted but if he was and there was no agreement, he would bear 50% of such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Costs of $1,000 was ordered to be paid by the F to the M for the enforcement application and each party was to bear their own costs for the variation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Despite their geographical distance and emotional baggage, I hope the F and the M can find a way to coparent and for the F to be involved in his children’s lives.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[35] – [37] of the F’s affidavit of evidence in chief, affirmed on 30 September 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Anandan Krishnan, <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined</em>, Vol. 8, (2008 Ed, Lexis Nexis), p 664.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Charter as of 16 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Black’s Law Dictionary, Chief Editor Bryan A.

In some cases, the parties use incorporated legal entities to carry out the business, while some maintain unincorporated business structures or organisations, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       While the use of the business structures during the marriage is often up to the spouses’ choice (which could be motivated by personal or commercial reasons), how these businesses were dealt with in the context of the ancillary proceedings following the spouses’ divorce may bring about some interesting legal questions, including what parts of these businesses constitutes matrimonial assets and how they ought to be valued. Indeed, these questions may be further complicated when both spouses treated the ownership of the family business informally throughout the marriage. These were some of the issues which the Court had to address when determining the ancillary matters (“AM”) for FC/D 3654/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The present case involves a marriage of approximately 21 years. The Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Wife”) have one daughter, [E], born in 2014. Interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was granted to the parties on 7 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the AM proceedings on 24 July 2025 (“AM Hearing”), during which, both parties’ counsel confirmed that the following AM issues were disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the division of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the maintenance payable to the Wife and [E], post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>There were no live disputes in relation to the [E]’s custody and/or care arrangements as a consent order was recorded as part of the IJ (“Child Care Orders”), and these matters were <em>not</em> adjourned to be determined as part of the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In these grounds of decision, I will first address the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, followed by the Wife’s claim for maintenance for both herself and [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial Asset Pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I start by considering the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets (“Matrimonial Pool”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As I had alluded to above, this issue took on some significance in the present proceedings given the manner in which the parties’ managed the family’s business. In particular, the parties had disagreed over the treatment of several key assets, including what the Wife referred to as the Husband’s “Fruit &amp; Vegetable Business”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This is, in fact, a reference to the sole proprietorship business, <em>viz.</em>[EFVT] (“Business”), currently registered in the Husband’s name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It arose, in the course of the AM hearing, that the nature, and valuation, of the Business was a serious point of contention between the parties. At the Wife’s counsel’s request, I directed both counsel to file further written submissions on these matters. Both parties duly did so on 14 August 2025,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and I took the same into account in coming to my determination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       For present purposes, I first set out below the matrimonial assets which were largely undisputed between the parties. These were the items listed in the summary of assets set out in the Wife’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 1 – Matrimonial Pool (Undisputed)</u></b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"31.9%\"><col width=\"21.28%\"><col width=\"23.4%\"><col width=\"23.42%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Asset</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Matrimonial Flat</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$605,000</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">PS at [5]</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF Monies</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$167,233.74</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$89,935.86</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Bank Accounts</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$18,177.65</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(<em>including</em> Business account)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$23,677.20</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     With respect to the parties’ Housing and Development Board Flat property located at the northern region in Singapore (“Matrimonial Flat”), their respective valuation figure deferred by approximately $5,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As neither party provided clear evidence to support their claim (save that counsel submitted that their respective figure was based on recent transaction prices), I used the figure of $605,000 put forward by the Wife (which the Husband’s counsel did not seriously challenge).

It remained in the Husband’s possession as at the IJ date, and was only sold thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In fairness, the Husband did not challenge the fact that the vehicle was part of the Matrimonial Pool. Instead, the parties mainly disagreed on the value to be ascribed to the said vehicle. The Wife’s case was that a value of “<em>at the very least $100,000</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> should be used, whereas the Husband asked that the vehicle’s actual sale price of $60,000 be adopted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s principal point was that this asset was sold by the Husband at an undervalue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> To substantiate her case, she exhibited screenshots of online car sales listings and websites showing similar vehicle models (ie. Mercedes-Benz GLC 250) where the asking price exceeded $100,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, the asking price for a vehicle as listed on these websites do not necessarily reflect its actual value. Different considerations and factors affect the value of a motor vehicle, including the condition of the vehicle, its detailed technical specifications, and its mileage. The use of screenshots of online platforms as a means of valuation was thus too speculative. I therefore could not agree with the Wife’s arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On the Husband’s part, he provided a sale and purchase agreement with one “RJ Leasing” showing that the car was <em>in fact</em> sold for the sum of $60,000. In the absence of any evidence showing any impropriety with the transaction, I accepted that the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle represented its market value at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For completeness, the Wife also alleged that the Husband had failed to “account” for the sale proceeds was a separate matter he had received. In my view this was a separate matter and was not relevant to question of the asset’s value. In any case, the Husband had clearly indicated that he was prepared to “split” the proceeds with the Wife as part of the division of their matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The question of accountability did not arise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I thus added the amount of $60,000 back into the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Luxury Watches</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The next dispute pertained to the parties’ luxury watches. Their dispute was two-fold: (i) they disagreed on who was holding on to these watches. The Wife claimed that the Husband was holding on to several watches, while the Husband argued that it was the Wife who had held on to them; and (ii) they disagreed at to the value to be ascribed to these watches.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I begin by answering the more important <em>anterior</em> question – <em>ie.</em> how many watches there were in the first place. The parties each took a different position – the Husband claimed that there were two such watches whereas the Wife claimed that there were four. To answer this question, I am ultimately guided by what was in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To support his claim, the Husband provided the sales invoices for two watches purchased from one “[J] Boutique” in December 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These invoices were separately addressed to the Husband and Wife, with the total cost being $34,500 for both watches. The Wife, on the other hand, provided no evidence as to when the other two watches were purchased to substantiate her assertion that there were four watches in total.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the above reason, I found that only two luxury watches (<em>ie.</em> those purchased in 2020) would be part of the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Next, I valued these timepieces at their purchase prices. I did so as there was a lack of clear evidence by both parties as to the watches’ current market value. The only alternative offered by the Wife was to ascribe what she called a “conservative” value of $15,000 per watch.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>However, I declined to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even on its face, the Wife’s approach did not satisfactorily explain why her own watch (purchased for $10,500) would have increased in value by $42%, while the Husband’s watch’s value (purchased at $24,000) would have decreased by 40%, in the same period. As no evidence was tendered to buttress these claims, the Wife’s approach was both speculative and arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, insofar as the possession of the watches was concerned, I am prepared to accept the Wife’s case that, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband had possession of the watches. It was not disputed that the Wife had left the Matrimonial Flat to stay in a shelter in June 2023, and that a personal protection order as well as a CPS safety plan were made to ensure the Wife’s and the Child’s safety shortly thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     During this time, the Husband had sole occupation of the Matrimonial Flat but there was no documented claim that he had lost his Rolex watch until August 2023 (through his solicitors’ letter).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Accordingly, given the surrounding circumstances and the inference drawn from the Husband’s contemporaneous conduct at the material time, I found it more likely that the Husband had kept the watches in his possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cash on Hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife next alleged that the Husband had a habit of keeping a significant amount of cash at home (up to $100,000), in light of the cash-dependent nature of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Her counsel submitted that I should infer that the Husband likely had such an amount of money kept at home at any one time, which ten should be added to the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Having considered the evidence, I was not prepared to find that the Husband had a sum of $100,000 in cash stashed at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife supported her claim by reference to a message sent on 19 September 2022 where reference was made to existence of monies kept at home. In my view, the actual reference in the 19 September 2022 message was vague and unhelpful. The Wife merely mentioned in her message that “[e]<em>ven though you said that whatever amount I wanted, it’s in the drawer, but I know these are hard-earned money…</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> There was no specific description of where the “drawer” was located, nor was there any indication of the amount of money present therein. Importantly, there was also no written response from the Husband to the Wife’s assertion in her message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife submitted that since the Husband did not actively deny this statement <em>made by her</em>, it meant that he acknowledged the truth of her statement. With respect, I am not persuaded that she had discharged her burden to prove this asset’s existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In any case, even if that was true that there was some money in a “drawer” at home <em>in 2022</em>, there was insufficient evidence to justify the Court making an assumption that there was, as at the IJ date (2 years later), the same sum of $100,000 lying at home. It is trite law that what falls within the Matrimonial Pool ought to be determined as at the IJ date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties’ Business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I turn now to address the nature, and relevance, of the Business and its impact on the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On its face, the parties’ dispute appeared to be over the value which ought to be ascribed to the Business. The Wife claimed that the Business was worth at least $200,000,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>while the Husband submitted there was no market value to the Business whatsoever (although he acknowledged that the Business’ net profits for 2023 were $35,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She also submitted that the Business must have been a valuable one as a third-party had previously offered to purchase the Business for $150,000 some years earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As noted at [8] above, I had raised my concern to counsel that in light of the Business being a sole proprietorship, it would have had no separate legal personality from the Husband. In such a situation, how did the Wife envisage this “asset” to be divided between the parties?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To put matters in context, the present situation was unlike cases where the spouses’ business vehicle an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company) where what was to be divided in the divorce were the shares they held in the said company. In such cases, the question before the court would be the value <em>of these shares</em> (which are clearly assets they own).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, as the Business in the present case was a sole proprietorship, the Business’ assets (<em>eg.</em> cash, bank account monies, inventory, etc.) would have already been accounted for as part of the Husband’s <em>personal</em> assets since the Business had no distinct legal personality from the Husband, nor was it capable of holding assets in its own name. It was therefore unclear what the “valuation” which the Wife claimed should be attached to the Business relate to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response to the Court’s concerns, the Wife’s counsel sought leave for the parties to file further written submissions to address the same. In the Wife’s supplemental submissions, she recrafted her case and argued that the Business would include a measure “goodwill”. The existence of such “goodwill” meant that the Business had some form of intrinsic value, making it an asset divisible pursuant to s 112 of the WC,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> despite being a sole proprietorship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Having considered her counsel’s submissions, I was unable to agree with the Wife’s position. In my view, the Business <em>in the present case</em> was not an independent matrimonial asset which the Court could divide. I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Distinction between “value” and “asset”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     At the outset, I found it important to draw a conceptual distinction between valuing something (<em>ie</em>. ascribing something with a monetary value) on the one hand, and describing a thing as an asset (in the proprietary sense) on the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     While values can be ascribed to many types of properties or assets, not everything capable of being valued is an “asset” divisible in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Take, for example, a painter’s ability to paint a picture. Someone may pay a lot of money to commission him to paint, but his painting ability is not an asset in the proprietary sense. <em>If he produces a painting</em>, then it is the painting which is the asset, not his ability to paint. Both can be ascribed a monetary value, but only the painting can be divided as a matrimonial asset in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As such, while it may be that the Husband’s Business was capable of being valued, in the sense that it is possible for someone (such as the accountant engaged by the Wife) to ascribe a value to this business undertaking, it did not necessarily follow that the Business was <em>ipso facto</em> a type divisible matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In support of her case, the Wife’s counsel cited the High Court (Family Division)’s decision in <em>XEB v XEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32323-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 37</a> (“<em>XEB</em>”) as an example of a case where the court had accepted a sole proprietorship as being an “asset”, and subsequently divided the same between the divorced parties. However, I did not understand the High Court’s judgment in <em>XEB</em> to stand for the legal proposition advanced by the Wife, <em>ie.</em> that a sole proprietorship was by its nature a divisible asset in divorce proceedings. Indeed, the nature of a sole proprietorship as a type of matrimonial asset was not an issue which arose in that case, nor did the High Court specifically discuss the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Moreover, it was not clear from the judgment whether the High Court’s reference to a “sole proprietorship” was a reference to specific assets and properties owned by the sole proprietorship in that case, or to the underlying business itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     If a sole proprietorship owned tangible and/or physical assets, it would not be controversial that these assets could be matrimonial assets capable of division. That, however, was not what the Wife sought to argue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Goodwill and intangible properties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     To be clear, it is also uncontroversial that a business can own various types of <em>intangible</em> assets. Some common ones include intellectual property rights, digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies), or even choses in action (such as licensing rights, monies held in bank accounts, etc.). These are assets which <em>can</em> be sold, transferred, disposed-of and thus divisible between the divorcing parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     If a business owns these assets through an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company), then the value of these assets may be taken into account when valuing the shares in the incorporated entity. If such assets are owned by an unincorporated association (such as a sole proprietor), then these asset would have been held in the business owner’s own name and therefore divided as part of that person’s personal assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     “<em>Goodwill</em>” in a business is, arguably, a type of intangible asset since it is a form of property and is capable of being assigned: see <em>New Ping Ping Pauline v Eng’s Noodles House Pte Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26592-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 1317</a> at [127]. For present purposes, I shall assume (without deciding) that a business’ goodwill is capable of being a matrimonial asset although I express some reservations as to how such goodwill may be “divided” in AM proceedings. For example, such an asset would not be capable of any <em>in specie</em> distribution unlike most other forms of matrimonial assets (such as cash, real property, or shares in a company). To avoid doubt, for reasons I will come to at [54(c)] below, the goodwill I am referring to here is the type of goodwill which is attached to (and synonymous with) the <em>business</em>, and not the proprietor running it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On a related note, the Wife’s counsel referred in their written submissions, albeit briefly, to the existence of “<em>repeat clientele, and a proven capacity for profit</em>” as something owned by the Business in the present case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It was not clear whether the Wife was referring to something different from the goodwill of the Business. Be that as it may, no authority or precedent were cited to suggest that these would amount to independent assets of a sole proprietorship which are divisible in a divorce. In my view, these matters – by their nature – would not be capable of being treated as a freestanding asset belonging to the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s arguments, even if accepted, lacked evidential basis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The upshot of the above discussion is that there remains some uncertainty as to whether a business (carried out as a sole proprietorship) is capable of being considered a freestanding asset divisible under s 112(10), WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Nevertheless, even if I was prepared (at least at a conceptual level) to accept that unincorporated businesses may themselves be divisible matrimonial assets so long as they comprise intangible assets (such as goodwill) which are independent from their proprietor’s personal assets and/or property, this would still not bring the Wife’s case very far on the facts of the present case. That is because the Wife had failed to show that the Business, <em>ie.</em> [EFVT], actually owned any such asset for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>First</u>, all the Wife had shown – through her accountant’s affidavit – was that the Business generated sales revenue, profits and loss in the past.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> However, these, in and of themselves, were not assets capable of being divided unless they were traceable to monies contained in the Business’ bank account (which have already been accounted for).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Second</u>, despite making submissions on the relevance of “goodwill” in the Business, the Wife did not provide any actual professional and/or expert report which ascribed a <em>value</em> to the Business’ goodwill specifically. The Business’ estimated net profit was clearly not the same as its goodwill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, I was doubtful whether the Wife could point to what exactly was the so-called “goodwill” in question given the very nature of the Business (<em>ie.</em> the wholesale of vegetable and fruits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>). The Business had no registered intellectual property rights and/or branding, and there being no evidence to suggest that the Business’ brand or name was what was responsible for generating sales or revenue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The nature of the Husband’s Business was unlike the sort mentioned in the UK Tax Tribunal case of <em>Richard Villar v. The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs</em> [2019] UKFTT 117 (TC) (<em>“Richard Villar</em>”), a cited by the Wife’s counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>Richard Villar</em>, the appellant doctor had sold his medical practice and the issue before the tax tribunal was whether the sale proceeds therefrom should be considered as a form of capital gain, or it should be considered as taxable income. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal found that Dr Villar had built a practice unlike that of many other surgeons, and that the name <em>“Richard Villar</em>” was capable of attracting customers notwithstanding the fact that not all medical services were provided by Dr Villar himself. There was thus goodwill in the <em>name</em> of the medical practice. That was <em>not</em> the situation in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_f\"></a>(f)     For completeness, I note that in some foreign jurisdictions, a distinction is drawn between the concept of “enterprise goodwill” (which attaches to an entity) and “personal goodwill” (which is associated with a person), with the latter not being capable of division in divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <u>Third</u>, the Wife had advanced a case where she characterised herself as was one of the two “bosses” who had built the Business;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> she was well acquainted with the Business having “<em>communicated with customers, suppliers, and the landlord, and personally handled the withdrawal and deposit of funds for business purposes</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This meant that any goodwill associated with the Business may well have vested in her as a form of personal goodwill. How then does one account for what she had brought to the Business over the years?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_h\"></a>(h)      <u>Fourth</u>, the fact that there was an alleged third-party who offered to “purchase” the Business in 2023 was, in my view, of little assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The terms of this alleged offer were not put before the Court and it was unclear what this offer entailed? Did it include the assignment or transfer of rights/liabilities? Would there be any restrictive covenants which the Husband had to give, or was he required to provide his knowhow? These were all important considerations and factors which would affect what was being sold, and the price offered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In the absence of any concluded sale and purchase agreement, the Wife’s case that the existence of a previous offer meant that the sole proprietorship was itself an “asset” was too speculative</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In the circumstances, I was not persuaded that a separate value should be ascribed to the Business, other than the Husband’s personal assets which were disclosed and which already formed part of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool (including the Business’ corporate bank account).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     To be clear, that does not mean that the Husband’s knowhow, and his ability to bring in sales and revenue in the fruit and vegetable wholesale business, were wholly irrelevant. These were matters which may be considered as part of the Wife’s maintenance claims, but they do not amount to an asset that was divisible in the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Accordingly, my determination of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 3 – Matrimonial Pool

to discuss the appropriate ratio of division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the structured approach recognised in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (<em>“ANJ</em> approach”) should be used as the Wife was an active income-earner

submitted that the trends-based approach (based on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a>) should be applied instead.

In the Husband’s written submissions, he asserted that the Wife was only working “part-time” in the earlier part of the marriage, prior to the birth of their child in 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Insofar as the Business was concerned, I found the following changes to its ownership and structure to be relevant to my assessment as to the nature of the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 19 November 2010, the Business was first registered <em>in the Wife’s</em> name only. This meant she was its sole proprietor at that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was subsequently added as an owner on 4 May 2012. The Business thus became an unincorporated <em>partnership</em> between the two spouses, and continued to be so until 24 August 2016 when the Husband withdrew from the partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From that point, the Wife was, once again, the Business’ sole proprietor until 31 January 2021 when she too withdrew from the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, the Husband was then registered as its sole proprietor/owner on 1 February 2021, and continued to be its proprietor ever since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above information was clearly set out in the business profile search provided by the Wife. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In light of the above and for the reasons set out at [65] and [80] below, I found the present case to have been a dual-income marriage from 2003 to 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In other words, for a period of 13 years (out of the parties’ 21 years of marriage), the Wife had been working.

This was on account of her view that the “<em>parties’ assets are all acquired using the</em> [Business’] <em>monies”.</em> I did not agree with her argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For reasons personal to themselves, the parties chose to have certain assets vested in each of their own names during the marriage. There was no clear evidence as to which asset was purchased by which spouse during which period of the marriage. The Wife acknowledged, in her own affidavit, that the Husband had kept the cash profit from the business.

id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Having determined the parties’ DFC, I now move on to consider their indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect Contribution Ratio (“IDC”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     When determining the parties’ IDC, the case law is clear that the Court does “<em>not</em> [indulge] <em>in a rigid and mechanistic calculation exercise</em>” and would instead adopt what is often referred to as a “broad-brush” approach.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> This means that the Court focuses on “<em>broad factual indicators such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> rather than going into the minute aspects of the parties’ family life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> This is especially so given that the parties’ marriage here spanned more than 2 decades.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In broad terms, I accepted the Wife’s claim that the parties’ respective roles were that the Husband would be the principal (although not sole) breadwinner through his knowledge and expertise in the fruit and vegetable wholesale industry. The main business vehicle they had used to earn the family’s income is the Business. The Wife, on the other hand, took on more home-making and childcare responsibilities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> while continuing to provide accounting, manpower and customer-related support services in furtherance of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> This was the arrangement for a significant period of the marriage up until 2023 (which was after the breakdown of the marriage due to the Wife’s discovery of the Husband’s latest extra-marital affair).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Overall, while the Husband’s indirect contributions were mainly financial in nature, the Wife made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions. I also took into account the Wife’s contributions and efforts in conceiving (through difficult procedures such as <em>in-vitro</em> fertilisation),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> raising, and caring for their daughter, [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     For completeness, I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the Husband’s conduct had risen to the level where a <em>negative</em> contribution value ought to be ascribed to him. The precedents cited by her counsel – such as <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17048-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 195</a> – involved far more egregious conduct. The Wife’s own submissions recognised the high bar before a negative contribution would be ascribed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> I found that the Wife’s allegations, founded on the Husband’s philandering and other behaviour, did not meet the requisite threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     However, I did not disregard the Wife’s steadfast and stoic tolerance of the Husband’s unsavoury behaviour, and her continued care of the home and their child in difficult circumstances. Instead, I factored these considerations in when assessing the appropriate IDC ratio.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Overall, adopting a broad-brush approach, I found it reasonable to ascribe an indirect contribution ratio of 70:30, in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adverse Inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     I move on now to the issue of adverse inference. The Wife submitted that a 5% adjustment (or “uplift”) should be made to account for the adverse inference which should be drawn against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Wife’s main point was that the Husband had been less than candid with his assets, and had concealed the true extent of his wealth. According to the Wife, the Husband’s claim that he was merely an <em>employee</em> of one [JS] Pte Ltd (“JSPL”) should not be believed, and that, in truth, he was using JSPL as a means to divert matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Her assertions and claims were set out in her counsel’s written submissions. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     I agreed with the Wife’s counsel that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband. In addition to the points raised in the Wife’s submissions (which I broadly accepted), I make the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the overall tenor of the Husband’s case (and arguments he advanced) to be inconsistent with what the evidence showed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Husband claimed to be a vegetable seller (earning an income of $2,500 per month) and a delivery driver (earning another $1,400 per month), I agreed with the Wife that his expenditures and the amount of money he had deposited into his bank accounts were not consonant with a person earning only $3,900 per month. Despite the alleged modest income, the Husband was able to purchase and drive a car (of a luxury make and model), purchase expensive luxury watches, and indeed, fully paid off his property several years after its purchase, while at the same time, claimed to be main person responsible for paying all of the family’s finances. None of these would have been possible if he had only earned $3,900 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     More importantly, it was highly suspicious that his alleged employer, JSPL, was wholly owned by one [WY],<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> whom the Wife alleged that [WY] was the Husband’s romantic partner. What was more concerning (and telling) was that the documents showed that [WY] <em>was also the Husband’s employee.</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s affidavit disclosed CPF records showing the Business paying CPF contributions for its “employees”, one of whom was [WY].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_d\"></a>(d)     This entire corporate structure/arrangement was thus highly suspicious to say the least. Moreover, the monetary transactions between the Husband and JSPL were also highly questionable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For example, the Husband received a sum of $15,000 on 29 April 2024 which he claimed to be payment for the supply of vegetables to his client.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> But this so-called “client” was shown to be JSPL, which the Husband declared was his alleged <em>employer</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_f\"></a>(f)     How did the Husband’s employer end up becoming his client? The Husband failed to provide any clear explanation for this highly anomalous situation. Moreover, JSPL’s listed business activities in its business registration were for “<em>general cleaning services</em>” which would have ostensibly nothing to do with the Husband’s Business, involving the supply and purchase of vegetables.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_g\"></a>(g)     All these suspicious circumstances and transactions put together supported the Wife’s claim that there was a <em>prima facie</em> case of concealment of assets for which the Husband did not provide any reasonable justification for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I therefore found that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband, and would thus include a 5% uplift (under the uplift method recognised in <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a>) in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     For completeness, 5% of the parties’ matrimonial assets amount to approximately $49,000. This sum was approximately equivalent to 1 year of the Husband’s declared salary of $3,900 per month. I found this to be a reasonable estimate of the amount which would have been concealed by the Husband between 2023 (when the Wife remained involved, albeit tangentially with the Business,<span

It was also not disputed that the Wife was gainfully employed as an office worker earning a salary of approx. $1,550.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     While this amount appears low compared to the standard of living which she was accustomed to during the marriage, it is well established law that a post-divorce maintenance order is not meant to provide a “meal ticket for life” nor should it create a life-long dependency.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Ultimately, the Wife is expected to exert herself, and to earn as much as reasonably possible.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> It was for this reason that I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the appropriate maintenance order in the present case should be “<em>forward-looking, calibrated to ensure the wife’s long-term financial security…</em>”, nor should the order provide a “<em>buffer for retirement planning and contingencies</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> These factors were, in my view, <em><u>not</u></em> the purpose of a post-divorce maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Overall, I found it appropriate to order the Husband to provide a sum of $500 per month for a period of 3 years (or $18,000 in total).

expenses, the focus was on the appropriate budget to be provided: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10] and [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Further, in <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a> (at [50] of its judgment), the High Court (Family Division) aptly noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">50    In my view, <b>a child’s reasonable needs are not determined solely by the financial capabilities of its parents</b>. The focus of the enquiry should be on whether the expense itself is needed for each child. <b>Although wealthy parents may indulge their children beyond what they reasonably need, they can expend the largesse at their pleasure</b>. The court is only concerned with what a child in the circumstances reasonably needs. In this connection, the full expenses of a tertiary education at an overseas institution are not reasonable expenses that parents should be mandated to pay for — simply on the basis that they can afford it. Instead, they are luxury expenses that parents can choose to indulge their children in. A much more reasonable expense is the costs related to tertiary education at a local university or a portion thereof. Furthermore, there is no reason why children who wish to pursue an overseas education cannot take on some responsibility for their decision, for instance by either off-setting some of their unnecessary expenses, obtaining scholarships, grants, and student loans, or contributing to their own expenses by working part-time. Children should not simply expect their parents to provide for every desire.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Accordingly, when considering [E]’s expenses, I made the following adjustments to the Wife’s claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the amounts provisioned by the Wife for [E]’s school allowance, eating out, public transport, and clothing to be very high, and possibly duplicative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For example, school allowance at $440 per month would translate to $22 per school day (<em>ie.</em> 5 school days a week) for a 11-year-old child. Yet, there was an <em>additional amount</em> of $500 per month provisioned for “eating out”. I thus scaled down these expenses to what would be reasonable amounts having regard to [E]’s age and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_c\"></a>(c)     [E]’s transport costs were similarly exorbitant. The claim of $100 per month puts her costs at the same quantum as the Wife’s own transport claim. It was apparent from the Wife’s own summary, that her claim was for “<em>Public transport (Ez-link/SimplyGo)</em>”. These were references to the stored value and/or transport cards used for public trains and buses in Singapore. However, as a school student, [E] would be eligible for concession fares on these modes of transportation. These would cost a fraction of what the Wife has claimed. There was no reason why the Wife should not take steps to use these cheaper means of transportation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I move on to the claim for Tuition classes, which represented the largest claim by quantum (<em>ie.</em> $1,580 per month). The Wife, in her counsel’s submissions, argued that [E]’s expenses were “<em>supported by itemised tables and receipts</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> That, in itself, meant little. As the High Court (Family Division) held in <em>WBU v WBT</em> [2023] SGHCF, “[t]<em>he mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I was not persuaded that the Wife had justified these tuition expenses. There was no evidence provided as to [E]’s grades in school, any report on how she was doing, and whether she required tuition to help with her learning and development objectives. It was not enough to simply claim that there were tuition expenses. The <em>need</em> for these expenses had to be established. Moreover, even based on the actual payment vouchers exhibited, it was not clear that entire sum of $1,580 <em>per month</em> had been shown to be incurred.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> For example, the Math, English and Chinese tuition classes for May 2024 added up to only $670 based on the receipts provided. That was significantly less than the amount claimed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Overall, I allocated a <em>budget</em> of $500 per month, which the Wife (as the care parent) could make use of to match and assess [E]’s educational needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Finally, for holiday expenses, I found this item to be a purely item of luxury given that it was meant to be holidays to visit the Wife’s family members in Malaysia. Moreover, a sum of $400 <em>per month</em> was clearly an excessive amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Overall, I found [E]’s reasonable expenses (including her share of the household expenditure) to be approximately $2,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I thus ordered the Husband to contribute a sum of <u>$1,600 per month</u> as the [E]’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In reaching this amount, I took into account the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I did not accept that the Husband’s actual monthly income and earning capacity to be only $3,900 as he had alleged. For the reasons set out above, I found that he was able to earn at least <em>twice</em> that amount from the Business (including the control and influence he wields over JSPL). I had alluded to the Husband’s earning capacity and his know-how and abilities at [56] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This meant that his income/earning capacity would make up approximately 80% of the parties’ combined income. I thus found it reasonable to apportion [E]’s expenses in proportion to the parties’ income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    Finally, I decided not to make any orders in relation to the reimbursement of [E]’s medical fees or for a blanket order relating to her future university education. I found neither to be necessary at this stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    I had already provisioned a monthly budget for medical and dental expenses. There was no evidence that [E] suffered from any specific long-term or special medical condition which necessitated an <em>ad hoc</em> medical expenses reimbursement order. As for university education, I found that claim to be wholly speculative at the present juncture. There is still almost one decade more before [E] enters university, and that is a matter which can be addressed through subsequent applications, if the need arises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the premises, I set out below a summary of my final AM orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of Matrimonial Flat</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I gave the Wife the option to acquire the Husband’s share of the parties’ Matrimonial Flat by giving him written notice within 1 month from the date of my order.

Even up to this point, the Father has refused to disclose the whereabouts of the children. Upon my query, the Father’s counsel clarified that prayer 1 is an application for stay of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> and that neither prayer 1 nor prayer 2, if granted, would lead to a dismissal of the Mother’s application as sought in prayer 3. In light of the Father’s clarifications, there were in substance two applications to be determined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The first was prayer 2, which was the Father’s application to set aside the service of the court papers on the ground that he was out of jurisdiction when the substituted service was effected. This was dealt with as a preliminary issue and parties agreed that it would be helpful to obtain from the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”) the entry and exit records of the Father and the two children from April 2025 to May 2025, which counsel for the Father helpfully facilitated. To save time and costs, parties also agreed for the ICA’s reply to be tendered to court via correspondence without the need for the Father to file an affidavit exhibiting the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The second was prayer 1, which was the Father’s application to stay the proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I heard the applications sequentially and dismissed both prayers with costs fixed at $3,000 to the Mother. As the Father has appealed against part of my decision <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 26/2025 filed on 2 September 2025, I now provide my written grounds of decision incorporating my brief grounds with elaborations where required.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside service of process</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father says that when the court papers were served on 7 May 2025 by way of substituted service in Singapore, he was physically present in China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Father submits that where a respondent is outside of Singapore, service must be effected by way of service out of Singapore, and leave of court must be sought for such service.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> As no leave was obtained, the substituted service effected in Singapore was defective and invalid.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The Father further contends that the substituted service by way of Singpass contravened the laws and public policy of China<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and is hence contrary to P.7, r.11(6) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“FJGR”), which provides that “[n]othing is to be done under this Rule that is contrary to the laws of the foreign country”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Citing the case authority of <em>Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v P T Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17427-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 144</a>, the Father asserts that substituted service is only allowed if it does not contravene the law of the foreign jurisdiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I was not persuaded by the Father’s arguments that the substituted service was defective because it was effected on a day when he was out of Singapore. It is an established principle that the effect of substituted service carried out pursuant to an order of court is equivalent for all purposes to actual service. The document will be regarded as being properly served: see <em>Singapore Court Practice (Lexis Nexis)</em> at [7.7.9] and <em>Singapore Rules of Court – A Practice Guide</em> (Academy Publishing, 2023) at [07.038].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In my judgment, it is immaterial that the Father was not in Singapore when the substituted service was effected. To challenge the validity of the service, the Father would have to challenge the validity of the order for substituted service itself. Hence, the issue, correctly framed, is whether there are grounds to set aside the order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Where a respondent had left Singapore before the originating process was issued, a claimant would have to first seek permission to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction before resorting to substituted service: see <em>Consistel Pte Ltd and another v Farooq Nasir and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/61546-M.xml')\">[2009] SGHC 82</a> (at [30]) (“<em>Consistel</em>”). As noted in <em>Consistel</em> (at [35]), this general rule is subject to at least two exceptions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Of course, the principle stated in [30] above is a general rule to which there are exceptions. One clear exception mentioned earlier is where the defendant leaves the country in anticipation that legal proceedings will be initiated against him. In such a situation, substituted service would be warranted. Another exception is when a defendant is constantly moving from country to country such that it is impossible to serve the writ on him personally. In such a case, there is no need to apply for personal service out of jurisdiction since any attempt at personal service clearly will be futile. Substituted service will suffice. There may be other exceptions but it would be unwise to speculate. Even so, these exceptions do not detract from the force of the general principle that applying for personal service out of jurisdiction should be the first port of call for plaintiffs who have to serve a writ on defendants who are outside Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the present case, it was unnecessary for me to consider whether the exceptions to the general rule apply. This is because I was of the view that there was no requirement for the Mother to seek permission to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As explained in my brief grounds, there is no evidence to suggest that the Father had left Singapore permanently before the OAG proceedings were initiated against him on 14 April 2025. On the other hand, there is ample evidence to support the Mother’s claim that the Father is ordinarily resident in Singapore. This is further corroborated by the ICA records, which show that the Father was in Singapore on 14 April 2025 when the OAG proceedings were initiated, and had made multiple trips in and out of Singapore from 15 April 2025 to 31 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The fact that the Father happened to be out of Singapore on the day that the substituted service was effected was purely fortuitous. It does not change the fact that he ordinarily resides in Singapore. That position remained unchanged even when the order for substituted service was made on 2 May 2025. There is no basis as such to set aside the order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It follows that P.7, r.11(6) of the FJGR also does not apply, since the originating process was served <em>within</em> jurisdiction <em>via</em> a valid order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For the above reasons, I dismissed prayer 2 of SUM 1244.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Having dealt with prayer 2, I turn now to prayer 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for stay</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Although prayer 1 was framed as a declaration that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the present proceedings, counsel for the Father clarified that the Father is seeking a stay of the proceedings on the ground of <em>foreign non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It is trite that under stage 1 of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the burden rests on the party seeking the stay to show that there is another available forum that is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to determine the dispute. In determining which forum is more appropriate, the court takes into consideration various connecting factors, the weight of which varies with each factual matrix. A factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might not be that important in another: see <em>AZS v AZR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0102.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 102</a> (at [11(a)]) and <em>BDA v BDB</em> 1 SLR 607 (“<em>BDA v BDB</em>”) (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Where the stay application relates to proceedings involving the custody of a child, the application of the welfare principle requires the court to examine which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the child. In the seminal decision of the Family Division in <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16809-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 4</a> (“<em>TDX v TDY</em>”), Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) observed (at [15]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In my view, the application of the welfare principle in a case such as the present involves the proper application of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, which would in turn require the court to examine which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the child. Support for this view can be found in the decision of <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0570.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 570</a> (“<em>Re A</em>”), in which Lai Kew Chai J referred to the decision of the House of Lords in <em>De Dampierre v De Dampierre</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68561-E-M.xml')\">[1988] AC 92</a> (“<em>De Dampierre</em>”), which was a case where the <em>Spiliada</em> principles were applied to matrimonial proceedings. The learned judge considered at [4] that when applying <em>De Dampierre</em> and the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to issues relating to a child, the central question is which forum would more effectively evaluate the best interests of the child …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As noted by the learned judge, the court has to take into account a host of factors in order to identify the forum that is better equipped to determine the child’s best interests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The relevance and weight of the factors must be decided in the light of the welfare of the child. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Habitual residence of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     One of the factors is the habitual residence of the child. This was a key plank of the Father’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> that merited some attention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As noted in <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [27]), the habitual residence of the child is a relevant consideration in deciding which forum is more appropriate to decide on the issues concerning a child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The learned judge explained (at [33]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court of the child’s habitual residence is likely to have a close affinity with and good understanding of the child’s cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The habitual residence of the child both at the time of removal or retention and at the time of proceedings is relevant: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [34]). The habitual residence is not necessarily equivalent to domicile, citizenship or nationality, but is the country to which the child is closely connected, having lived in it for some time and integrated into its community and culture. The child’s habitual residence is one of factors to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of the particular case: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [37], [38] &amp; [45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To determine the child’s habitual residence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court will have to consider where the child has been living and how settled she is in that country, including how integrated she is to the country in terms of the environment, education system, culture, language and people around her in that country. The court will also have to consider where her parents are habitually resident and whether one or both parents had the intention that the child should reside there.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In the supporting affidavit, the Father averred as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The children are presently habitually resident in China and are enrolled in school there. There have no legal status, domicile, or habitual residence in Singapore. The children are not even in Singapore at the moment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Apart from the bare assertion that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”, the Father did not provide any detail to substantiate his claim. In my view, this omission is glaring because the evidential burden of proof lies with the Father to prove that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”: see s 105 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed). The Father did not provide any evidence as to when the children were taken out of Singapore, let alone how well they have integrated back in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Furthermore, the Father’s claim that the children are “presently habitually resident in China” is contradicted by the ICA records, which show that the children were present in Singapore throughout most of April and May 2025. In fact, I found the Father’s claim that “the children are not even in Singapore at the moment” to be rather misleading, as the ICA records show that the children were in Singapore on 31 May 2025, the same day that the Father affirmed his supporting affidavit in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Further, the immigration records from the Chinese authorities dated 9 June 2025 also contradicted the Father’s claim. The records show that the children returned from China to Singapore on 1 February 2025 and had not returned to China since.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     There is also no evidence from the Father to shed light on the circumstances leading to the children being relocated back to China, whether he has obtained the consent of the Mother to relocate them and the whereabouts of the children. These are basic facts that the court would need to make a proper assessment of the children’s habitual residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the absence of such evidence, I was left with the Mother’s evidence which shows that sometime in August 2023, the Father proposed for the children and the Mother to relocate to Singapore from China so that the children could benefit from an education in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The family relocated to Singapore sometime in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> From August 2023 to February 2024, the children were studying at [School A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> and in August 2024, the children were studying at [School B].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Mother also produced evidence to show that the children were in attendance at the school’s events and activities as recent as May 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and that they were still enrolled in [School B] as at 5 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The Mother also averred that she did not know about or consent to the Father removing the children from Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As it stood, there was simply insufficient evidence to substantiate the Father’s claim that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”.

As discussed in Debbie Ong, <em>International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at page 244:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Custody disputes are unique because the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. It is not surprising that despite a prior foreign custody order, the court, guided by the welfare principle, may be willing to re-open a custody dispute and determine the case on its merits. The Privy Council, in <em>Mark T Mckee V Evelyn McKee</em>, a case on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada, had held years ago that it is the negation of the welfare principle not to enter into the merits of the question afresh, even where there is a foreign order in existence. Lord Simonds held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But it is the negation of the proposition, from which every judgment in this case has proceeded, namely, that the infant’s welfare is the paramount consideration, to say that where the trial judge has in his discretion thought fit … to examine all the circumstances and form an independent judgment, his decision ought for that reason to be overruled. Once it is conceded that the court of Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the question of custody and that it need not blindly follow an order made by a foreign court, the consequence cannot be escaped that it must form an independent judgment on the question, though in dong so it will give proper weight to the foreign judgment. What is the proper weight will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is clear from the above passage that the Singapore court is not bound by a prior foreign custody order as it is required under the welfare principle to examine the merits of the case afresh. Hence, even if the dispute had been adjudicated in China, the Father’s arguments, premised on the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, could not succeed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Moreover, family circumstances involving children can change over time. Unlike final civil judgments, custody orders are not final and conclusive in the strict sense as they are subject to variation when there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child. It is clear from the available evidence that circumstances have changed since the mediated agreement, which necessitates a review of the custody and access arrangements. As such, the Mother’s application in OAG 74 is not a re-litigation, nor does it offend the principle of international comity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As noted earlier, a key plank of the Father’s case is that the children are habitually resident in China. However, the Father’s supporting affidavit is not only devoid of material particulars, but is also misleading. In his written submissions, he emphasised that the children are “physically present in China during these proceedings”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>, but that in turn begs the question of how they came to be there when there was an injunction restraining him from removing the children from Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I also found no merit in the Father’s submissions premised on public policy and the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>. Indeed, it is troubling that the Father has refused to disclose the whereabouts of the children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> thereby effectively cutting off the Mother’s access to them. Clearly, there are compelling reasons to review the custody and access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Balancing all factors, I found that the Father has not discharged the burden of showing that China is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore. In the circumstances, there was no necessity to proceed to stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test: <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [34].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For the above reasons, I dismissed the stay application.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s Affidavit (OAG 74)

before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SSP 858/2025 (“SSP 858”) was the Wife’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against her Husband. She alleged that the Husband had hurt her in an incident that had occurred on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February 2025. She claimed that her cutlery had gone missing. When she went to confront her Husband, who was in his room, he slammed the door shut against her fingers. She then decided to gather her cutlery for safekeeping. There was an altercation between herself and the Husband – she says he tried to snatch the cutlery from her, and in so doing, cut her thigh and broke her fingernails.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Apart from this incident, the Wife also accused the Husband of harassing her. For instance, she said that he would leave the house in a mess. She also pointed to various arguments they had over the splitting of household bills. Finally, she accused the Husband of stealing her jewellery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SSP 1143/2025 (“SSP 1143”) was the Husband’s application. He sought a PPO, as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) and a Stay-Away Order (“SAO”) against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband says that the Wife had inflicted physical abuse, as well as emotional and/or psychological abuse on him. He points to the same incident the Wife had relied on (above at [2]) where the both of them had fought over cutlery. He says that the Wife had confronted him about the missing cutlery in the corridor of their flat. He tried to move past her and brushed her aside. She punched him in the chest. The Husband also says that the Wife had threatened to “bring him down using the Women’s Charter” and began hitting herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition to this incident, the Husband also accuses the Wife of, amongst other things, falsely accusing him of physically assaulting her, stealing his personal belongings such as his Gucci slippers and sensitive documents, and tampering with his workstation. The Husband also accuses the Wife of using his toothbrush to clean the toilet bowl – he says he had discovered the toothbrush with strands of hair and dirt on it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I heard the trial of both matters on 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2025. After hearing oral submissions from parties, I dismissed both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The law makes it clear that to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that there had been family violence committed, or that it was likely that family violence would be committed: Section 60A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”). An applicant must also show that it would be necessary to make such an order for their protection and personal safety: Section 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties in the present case once shared their lives together. They were married. Their marriage has not worked out. Divorce proceedings were initiated and concluded. Final judgment was obtained. The Husband and Wife had both indicated their desire to go their own separate ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There was, however, one final thread holding them together – and that was the matrimonial flat. It was apparent to me from their evidence, as well as the allegations that each of them had brought against the other, that the main cause of their conflict was because they both continued to share a common space, which provided ample fuel for their continued dispute and discontent towards each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That being said, this final thread holding the both of them together was about to be severed. The house was about to be sold pursuant to the court order. That order provided that the flat was to be sold within six months after the date of the final judgment (which was extracted on 11 July 2025). Property agents had been engaged to facilitate the sale within the parameters set by the court order. Both the Husband and the Wife had also given evidence of their intention to go their own separate ways after the flat had been sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given this, it was apparent to me that neither party had established the necessity of ordering a PPO. As a result, both their applications must fail. Further, and because I have not granted the Husband’s application for a PPO, his application for a DEO and SAO must also fail: see Section 60B(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I therefore dismissed both SSP 858 and SSP 1143.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Whether a parent neglects to pay child maintenance where he has no knowledge of being the biological parent","Family Law – Maintenance – The applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn in trials on child maintenance","Family Law – Maintenance – Which parent should bear the cost of paternity test"],"date":"2025-10-10","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 750/2024","title":"XSR v XSS","citation":"[2025] SGFC 108","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33946-SSP.xml","counsel":["Wang Liansheng and Petrina Tan (Bih Li & Lee LLP) for the applicant","Lim Fung Peen, Samantha Ee and Chua Hong Hui (Yuen Law LLC) for the respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-10-15T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Teh Joo Lin","html":"<root><head><title>XSR v XSS</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSR <em>v</em> XSS </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33946-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 108</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 750/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">10 October 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Teh Joo Lin </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Wang Liansheng and Petrina Tan (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the applicant; Lim Fung Peen, Samantha Ee and Chua Hong Hui (Yuen Law LLC) for the respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XSR — XSS </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Whether a parent neglects to pay child maintenance where he has no knowledge of being the biological parent</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">The applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn in trials on child maintenance</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Which parent should bear the cost of paternity test</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">10 October 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Teh Joo Lin:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was an application for child maintenance under s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961. A unique feature of this matter lay in the applicant’s pursuit of the fullest possible extent of backdated maintenance for the two children, despite the respondent’s assertions that he had no knowledge of being their biological father until <em>after</em> a paternity test – commissioned after the commencement of the child maintenance proceedings – put the issue to bed. The issue of the respondent’s prior knowledge was therefore relevant to the question of just <em>when</em> his neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for the children properly arose, and in any event, whether on the facts of the case, the Court ought to order maintenance for the children on a backdated basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I first set out some brief facts. The applicant worked as a regional sales manager. The respondent was a businessman who ran corporate interests in Singapore and Malaysia, and who was married with two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The applicant had started working in the respondent’s company in 2011. In the subsequent years, the parties had a relationship. During this period, the applicant gave birth to two children, who were born in Oct 2016 and May 2022 (“the children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties’ relationship ended in 2023. It was undisputed that the applicant left the respondent’s company in June 2023, although their accounts differed as to why – he said it was because she had diverted business away. She said it was because of her finding out about his affair with another colleague.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In February 2024, it was alleged that the applicant contacted the respondent’s wife, informing her that she had had two children with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 28 March 2024, the applicant commenced her application for child maintenance for the two children. To clarify the issue of paternity, the parties underwent paternity testing, which confirmed on 23 August 2024 that the respondent was the biological father of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matter went through a somewhat lengthy pre-trial stage involving discussions over the paternity testing and several rounds of voluntary disclosure. By the time of the trial, the key issue to be addressed pertained only to whether an order of maintenance should be made and if so, the nature of that order. In this regard, the applicant had sought the maximum amount of backdated maintenance in relation to both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Another issue was on reimbursement for the cost of the paternity testing. The applicant’s position was for the respondent to bear the entire cost of the paternity test as he had challenged paternity in the first place. On the other hand, the respondent sought for the costs to be shared regardless of the outcome, on the basis that both parties equally required the results.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Children’s Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I started with the issue of maintenance for the children. The applicant sought $6,000 per month as maintenance for both children. Further, she sought for the Court to backdate the maintenance payments: for the elder child (“the daughter”), the backdating was to start from 1 April 2021, being the maximum period of three years prior to the time of the application; for the younger child (“the son”), the backdating was to start from May 2022, being the period from the son’s birth to the time of application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The respondent did not dispute that he should pay maintenance. However, his final proposal was to pay $2,517.34 to $2,936.89 a month for the children, and for the backdating to start only from March 2024, when the application was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The relevant provision, being section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter, provides that the Court may make an order for reasonable maintenance where there is due proof that a respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for a child. In making such an order, the Court must first be satisfied that the applicant has discharged the burden of proving that the respondent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. To determine if this legal threshold is satisfied, the Court must first determine what the monetary amount of “reasonable maintenance” is, on the facts of the case. The Court takes a “practical approach” to assess if the parties had reasonably provided such maintenance (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [44]-[45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Leaving aside my consideration of the parties’ respective means and incomes for the time being, I considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The amount that would constitute reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether there was neglect or refusal to provide such reasonable maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The amount of maintenance that should be ordered for the respondent to pay, including the question of backdated maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable Maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I first set out my assessment of the reasonable expenses of the children in the tables below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 1: Children’s monthly reasonable

The applicant’s counsel submitted that this was “commonly known as the <em>Browne v Dunn</em> rule”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The rule in <em>Browne and Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 is a common rule of evidence from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was true that the respondent’s counsel had not cross-examined the applicant on her estimated figures for most of the line items in her list of expenses, and of the estimates pertaining to the children’s expenses. However, this did not lead to the ineluctable conclusion that the applicant’s estimates should be adopted by the Court as incontrovertible. Ultimately, the Court must come to its own view on what was a reasonable expense for each line item, based on all the circumstances. In a related vein, it is trite that even if the applicant’s expenses were undisputed, or proven to be actual expenses, this did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that they were necessarily reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In any event, the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is rooted in fairness at trial. The stringency of application must surely depend on the context. This case occurred in the context of maintenance – specifically, during the exercise of ascertaining the monthly expenses based on parties’ reasonable estimates of various line items. In this context, there had been joinder in relation to most of the line items; the issue was what the value for each line item should be. The aim of the exercise was to assist the Court in ascertaining the reasonable expense to be assigned to a given line item, and it was clear to all concerned that both parties had come to trial with their respective estimates, of which some were accepted but others of which were disputed. The fact that the applicant’s estimates were not contested by the respondent’s counsel at trial, would not mean, without more, that the respondent’s estimates on the same line items ought then to be rejected in favour of the applicant’s estimates. Indeed, the applicant’s counsel went on to cross-examine the respondent on his competing estimates of the same line items. In the circumstances, I did not think there was any unfairness at trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I would also explain that in arriving at the Court’s assessment of the children’s reasonable expenses, I had, where appropriate, given more weight to the applicant’s estimates, for the simple reason that she was in a better position to understand the children’s expenses – it was undisputed that the respondent had never lived with her and the children. The applicant had also provided some receipts for various expenses. That being said, the law does not require every specific item of expense to be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise (see <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> at [13]). It followed that even if every item of expense was somehow proved, “the mere fact that one party shows that such expenditure was made does not automatically render that expenditure reasonable in the context of determining maintenance”: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On the whole, I found that some estimates of the applicant were higher than what would have been reasonable in the circumstances, and I had pared them down in exercising my discretion. On the applicant’s own case, she had had limited means – to the extent of having to borrow to make ends meet. Her evidence was that she took home about $2,400 a month, but the total of her estimated personal expenses and the children’s expenses was hitting $14,000 a month – close to six times more. In this regard, the Court heard that the applicant’s own evidence was that her personal financial circumstances had worsened, such that she was taking loans from her credit line “to finance her monthly expenses”, and obtaining money from friends and even the respondent’s relatives, who she was apparently acquainted with and had given her “some money”. Given that this apparently parlous situation had existed, on her own evidence, for some years, she would have been spending beyond her means, the implication being that there should be, or should have been, room for more sustainable budgeting. As explained below, I did find that the applicant’s means was probably higher than what her income from her full-time job would have suggested. Even then, I still found that her estimated expenses were too high in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In considering the standard of living that the children should reasonably enjoy, I gave some consideration to the principle that that parties were to bear their own expenses when spending on luxuries (see <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a>). This was especially the case where the respondent had never lived with the applicant and the children, and on the evidence of both parties, maintenance had never been given by him for the children’s upkeep, which would therefore have had been solely based on the applicant’s efforts. Having heard the evidence, I did accept that the respondent was a <em>potential</em> provider of some means, but he was neither a <em>past</em> nor <em>present</em> provider. Intuitively, there was some resonance to the suggestion that a father ought to maintain the children similarly to how he had been maintaining the children from his marriage. However, direct comparisons with the expenses of his own family could only go so far, as every family situation was different, and the ages and stages of life of the children were also different.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Neglect to make reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having established the reasonable expenses of the children as $5,165.46, the question was whether there had been neglect or refusal to pay reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The applicant bore the burden to prove neglect. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, on the respondent’s own case, he had never paid maintenance for the children. It was also the applicant’s position that the respondent had never maintained the children. In the premises, I agreed with the applicant’s submission that whatever the amount of reasonable maintenance, the respondent would have neglected to make that amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the respondent knew he was the biological parent before the application was made in March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     However, the question in this case was precisely <em>when</em> the neglect arose. This implicated the question of when the respondent knew that he was the father to the children – was it before the application was made in March 2024?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The duty of parents to maintain their children is clearly set out in section 68 of the Women’s Charter. The duty of a parent to maintain a child is rooted in biological fact – a parent should, without more, care for his or her own flesh and blood, where the child is unable to fend for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, knowledge is nevertheless relevant in deciding the question of whether there had been neglect of the duty to maintain the child under section 69. The elements of “neglect” or “refusal” suggests that some species of knowledge or intention is necessary in the omission to provide reasonable maintenance, and it would seem unreasonable to hold a parent as liable for neglect if he had not even been aware that he was the parent of a child. The touchstone for the conduct of the parties is reasonableness: <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [58]. Where it is unclear if a parent had knowledge of his status as a biological parent, it might not be reasonable to hold that he had neglected to make reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In this regard, the applicant had adduced various pieces of evidence. I had examined them. Whether taken alone or together, they did not lead to the finding that on the balance of probabilities, the respondent possessed the requisite knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     First, there were some photographs of the respondent with the daughter, and one photo with the son. On the photographs with the daughter, these included the respondent posing with her at a hotpot restaurant on her birthday, ostensibly in Oct 2022, and images of the respondent carrying her in a mall, and accompanying her to the zoo. In my view, those photographs were at the highest, piecemeal indications that the respondent had held himself out as a parent. It should be noted that the parties were in a relationship until June 2023, and it would not have been unusual for him to tend to the children as part and parcel of his relationship with the applicant, especially when they were going out. There appeared to be no photographs after the parties’ relationship ended in June 2023. While the respondent might have suspected that he was a parent to the daughter, that would not rise to the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological parent. In short, multiple inferences might be drawn from the photographs, of which the inference that the respondent had acknowledged the daughter as his biological daughter was only one of them. It was the same analysis for the lone photograph of the respondent with the infant son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I next turned to the exchange of text messages in June 2023 – when the parties’ relationship was on the rocks. This was arguably stronger evidence in support of the applicant’s case. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, the applicant had asked the respondent to “please ensure the transfer of the child’s expenses of $3,000 to my account on time every 1<sup>st</sup> of the month. You have not done so for this month – please do so quickly!” The respondent’s response was simply to ask the applicant not to be so “extreme”. There was no denial. This would appear to be suggestive that the respondent had at least assumed responsibility as the parent to at least one of the children. As the applicant’s counsel highlighted, the respondent’s explanations of the exchange of messages were dubious – I attached no weight to them and found that the explanations in fact damaged his general credibility as a witness. However, there remained the question of which child was being referred to in the message, and whether that meant that the status of the other child was in question. Moreover, at trial, the parties were content with the position that the respondent had never provided maintenance for the children in the first place – this limited the inferences that might have been drawn from that message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Critically, there was also evidence that pointed the other way. The most significant of this evidence was the statutory declaration that had been made by the applicant. In this case, the applicant had made a statement in 2016 that the daughter’s “biological father who is of Malaysia Nationality is no longer in contact with me. His name and whereabouts are unknown”. Given that a statutory declaration is a statement made to declare something to be true, absent any proof that the applicant had lied in the statutory declaration, it must be assumed that the applicant was stating the truth in the statutory declaration, which she tendered to HDB in 2020 as part of her request to buy a resale flat while retaining two private residential properties in Malaysia. This declaration was known to the respondent at the material time. It should also be noted that it was undisputed between the parties that the applicant did have a Malaysian boyfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     For completeness, I had also considered evidence such as the respondent having passed an “ang pow” to the daughter in June 2023, and the respondent forwarding information on direct school admissions in May 2023 to the applicant. But whether taken singly or together, having weighed the totality of the evidence, I found that the burden of proof had not been crossed insofar as proving that the applicant had the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological father of both children. By extension, the applicant had not proven that there had been neglect to provide reasonable maintenance in the period preceding the application. It was likely that the applicant had suspected that he was the parent to one or even both children, but that was in any event not tantamount to actually having knowledge or positively acknowledging that he was their father, with all the attendant responsibilities of providing of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In any event, I also found that there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication, which was necessary to establish neglect. One way that the Court can consider “reasonableness” is whether one party had reasonably communicated the child’s needs or expenses to the other part. In this regard, the courts have held that the alleged non-paying party “must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses” (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [48]). Consonant with the finding that there was insufficient evidence of knowledge on the respondent’s part that he was the parent to the children, there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication from the applicant to the respondent in relation to maintenance required for the children’s purported expenses, whether basic or otherwise. In her testimony, the applicant had said: “Over the past 9 years, he did not give us any amount allowance (<em>sic</em>).” Against this rather lengthy period, there was a paucity of evidence that requests for maintenance had been made. As mentioned above, while there was an exchange of text messages on the applicant purportedly asking the respondent to pay $3,000 a month for the child, there was a limit to the conclusions that might be drawn from that isolated exchange. In the event that I were wrong, I had taken the view that any backdating of maintenance should only be as far back as the time of filing the application – this will be discussed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having found that the respondent had neglected to pay reasonable maintenance from the time of application, the question remained as to the quantum that the respondent ought to be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The law is clear that both parties have an equal responsibility to provide for the children although their precise obligations may differ based on their means and capacities: <em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [36].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In this regard, I had reviewed the evidence and submissions of the parties’ respective income, means and assets. The respondent’s take-home salary was $5,438. In terms of the respondent, the respondent’s counsel submitted that as a company director, the respondent’s salary was “heavily dependent” on the company’s performance – and the company was loss-making. Further, the respondent had had to resort to borrowing from the banks and friends to fund his business expenditures and living expenses, with over $250,000 in debt to friends and family, and total debts and liabilities of over $2.3m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Nevertheless, I agreed with the applicant’s counsel’s submission that the respondent was a man of means, notwithstanding the purportedly poor financial state of his businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, and his apparent debts. He had higher financial means than what his income suggested. For example, while the respondent had claimed that he had taken various loans, some of them appeared to be friendly loans, in the sense that he was not subject to strict repayment timelines and other terms. An example would be a purported loan from the respondent’s wife, and another loan from his mother-in-law. It followed that the respondent’s financial situation was not as precipitous as he had suggested. While I was persuaded that he did have certain formal liabilities with financial institutions, the preponderance of the evidence suggested that the respondent had enjoyed a significant degree of free play and flexibility in managing his incomings and outgoings, through his ability to access both his personal and corporate accounts. It followed that even if he was in a net negative position, he was more likely than not, able to raise and rustle up sums of monies when the need occasioned. He had a demonstrated ability to finance his not-inconsiderable expenditure, whether through borrowings or otherwise. I therefore accepted the submission of the applicant’s counsel that “notwithstanding the alleged shortfall in his income to meet his expenses, and the alleged loans taken out… he has been able to pay down the alleged loans as and when he needed to”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent had been “struggling to make ends meet without sacrificing the lifestyle enjoyed by his family”. I accepted that the respondent had two older children from his marriage in their mid-teens, who were likely to incur more expenses as they progressed to tertiary education in the coming years. However, I based my findings on current finances. In any event, he had a duty to maintain <em>all</em> his biological children. Even if he had to make further changes to his lifestyle to support the maintenance payments, he would need to do so. Moreover, in relation to his family, the respondent had stated on affidavit that he had seven people living in his residence, and the expenses were borne by both him and his wife. This at least suggested that his wife was able to bear some of his financial load insofar as this pertained to the financial aspects of his married life. It did not appear that his in-laws were totally bereft of financial means as well, such that they required his full support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In relation to the applicant, the Court heard that the applicant’s financial situation had worsened over the past several years, suffering two distinct drops in salary to the present amount of $3,000 a month (take-home $2,399). Further, the applicant’s counsel submitted that unlike the respondent, the applicant did not have other sources of income from which she could draw from as and when necessary. While the applicant had set up a sole proprietorship, the applicant’s counsel submitted that any additional income was “ad hoc”, and not sufficient, stable, nor predictable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I found that the applicant was of a weaker financial standing than the respondent. However, I was of the view that the applicant’s financial means was likely to be more than her income suggested. The respondent’s counsel pointed out that her personal bank account showed inflows and outflows of money to the tune of thousands of dollars every month. What I noted was that the applicant, at the relatively younger age of 39, had significant earning capacity. Besides running a business on top of her salaried employment, she appeared to have – or had – properties in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. And while her tenant broke lease in September 2023, she might be able to rent out a room for more income. Based on the statements from her Business Growth Account, while the applicant said that the transfers made to her personal account were withdrawn in cash for payment to suppliers, it appeared that that was not always the case, as there appeared to have been withdrawals made at a toy shop and eateries. In any event, the applicant had also confirmed that she could be flexible with her personal expenses as long as the children were provided for – suggesting that she had some free play and flexibility as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Bearing in mind all the above considerations, I decided to use a rough and ready proxy for apportionment, as based on the stated monthly incomes – at 70:30 as between the respondent and the applicant. The figures had been adjusted slightly from about 69:31. I thought this would be fair. With the reasonable maintenance being $5,165.46, and applying the ratio, the respondent ought to be paying $3,616 a month (rounded down to $3,600). Having reviewed the expenses of both the respondent and the applicant, I was of the view that this apportionment would fall within their respective means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Backdated maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As mentioned above, in terms of backdating maintenance, I backdated only as far back as the time of the application in March 2024. The parties relied on <em>Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor</em> [2014] SGHC 185, where the High Court set out a list of factors to be considered in determining of backdated maintenance. There are overlaps in terms of the intent behind these factors, and I considered these factors in the light of the facts and circumstances. The applicant did not file for maintenance until March 2024, even though the daughter and the son were born in 2016 and 2022 respectively. Why she did not do so was therefore of critical importance. In this regard, among other explanations, the applicant’s counsel submitted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, when the applicant was earning $10,000 to $12,000 at the respondent’s company, she was in a position to pay for the children’s expenses singlehandedly, and therefore did not need the assistance of the respondent. However, she subsequently suffered drops in salaries and changes of circumstances, such that she had to make the present application. The applicant’s counsel highlighted that the timeframe for backdated maintenance – for up to three years prior to March 2024 – aligned with the timeframe of the applicant’s first drop in salary, from $10,000 to $12,000, to $5,000 to $6,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I did not discount the struggles of a single mother having to bring up two children. However, having reviewed the evidence, it did not appear that she was in that tight of a financial bind between March 2021 and March 2024, compared to the period thereafter. For the most part, save for nine months between June 2023 and March 2024, her salary was still at $5,000 to $6,000 a month. The son was not born until May 2022, so her financial burden would not have had significantly increased until then. It appeared that the applicant’s financial situation became much more of an issue only from the time her relationship with the respondent ended, culminating in her departure from his company in June 2023. Indeed, it was telling that her request to the respondent for $3,000 for the child took place then – the Court had not seen evidence of earlier requests of such money. The applicant was unemployed from June to October 2023, but she nevertheless had the benefit of a lease until September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, I did find that her financial needs continued to worsen thereafter – this was supported by evidence that she had taken out loans more recently. For example, she claimed to have borrowed $1,500 from her friend to repay her car loan in June 2024. The applicant’s counsel also highlighted her bank loans, which were reflected in the DBS Cashline statements from 2024. On the whole, it appeared that the need for child maintenance became more acute from the time that she left the respondent’s company in June 2023. This would have eventually prompted her to make the application in March 2024. Her sole proprietorship was also set up in June 2023 – while this might be seen as a new revenue source, it might also be inferred that she saw the need to seek avenues to shore up her financial situation at or around that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I was minded for the payments for maintenance to start from August 2024, when the paternity results were known. However, I found that the balance was better struck by ordering that the backdated maintenance was to be paid from the time of application in March 2024. As mentioned above, this was independent of my finding that there had been no neglect on the part of the respondent to maintain the children prior to March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The order for maintenance was therefore that the respondent was to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance. Payment was to start from September 2025. The respondent was to pay backdated maintenance from 28 March 2024, the month when the application was filed – for a total of 18 months. This amount was to be paid in instalments of $1,200. The payment was to be made at the end of every month to the applicant’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I noted that this amount ought not to be crushing for the respondent, as on his own submission, he was able to make payments of close to $5,000 a month – with his suggested $2,936.89 for monthly maintenance and request to pay maintenance arrears through $2,000 in monthly instalments. At the same time, with the maintenance, the applicant should have sufficient funds with which to bring up her children, while she continued to strengthen her financial footing. Of course, parties were at liberty to seek variations in the event of material change or other good cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cost of paternity testing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Ahead of hearing parties on costs, I dealt with the residual issue of who ought to bear the cost of paternity testing. The applicant’s counsel cited the recent case of <em>XIB v XIA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33441-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 40</a> in support of his contention that the respondent ought to bear the full costs. That case stood on stronger facts that militated in favour of an order for the father to bear the costs of the DNA test. The parties in that case had been married, with the child concerned conceived about eight years into the union. Given the facts of that case, it was patently unreasonable for the father to cast unsubstantiated aspersions on the paternity of the child. In the present case, the parties had never been married to each other. They had other partners. There were two children, who were both born out of wedlock. Moreover, as mentioned above, the applicant had stated through a statutory declaration that the respondent was not the biological father of the daughter. Despite that, while I had found that the respondent did not have the requisite level of knowledge for the purpose of finding neglect to maintain the children, I was of the view that he had at least been happy to go along with the <em>status quo</em>, even going out and posing with the children for photographs, until the parties ended their relationship in June 2023. While he would have at least suspected or wondered about the paternity, he did not issue a flat-out denial when the applicant sought $3,000 for the child via text message – at the terminal stage of the parties’ relationship. In the circumstances, I did not think that it would be unreasonable for the respondent to foot the full cost of paternity testing. The request to definitively resolve the paternity question only arose after the receipt of the application for child maintenance, in which the applicant had already taken the position that the respondent was the biological father. At that juncture in the life of the case, it could even be said that the respondent needed to know the result more. As the applicant had initially paid for a half-share of the costs of the paternity test, on the basis that the Court would eventually determine where the costs should fall, that sum was to be reimbursed to her by the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having heard counsel on costs, I made no order as to costs, save for ordering the respondent to pay $500 to the applicant for the adjournment of an earlier trial date in April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My orders were therefore summarised as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Respondent is to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance.

In this case, the Wife had failed to produce any evidence to support her bare and dubious claim that the remittances – totaling more than a quarter of a million dollars – were the Husband’s travel and entertainment expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the periodic nature and quantum of such remittances (with some as high as between $20,000 to $35,000)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> are more consistent with them being progress payments for the purchase of the Xiamen property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">B.    <u>Xiamen property is a matrimonial asset</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having accepted the Husband’s claim regarding the Xiamen property, I now come to the issue of whether it was a “matrimonial asset” and thus liable for division under s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). On this issue, s 112(10) defines “matrimonial asset” to mean –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>a</em>)    any asset acquired <em>before</em> the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <em>ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties</em> or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>b</em>)    any other asset of any nature acquired <em>during</em> the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On a plain reading of s 112(10), an important issue when determining whether a property is a “matrimonial asset” is <em>the time when it was “acquired”</em>. Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” as referring not to the point of purchase of a property – but the time when it has been fully paid for: <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33368-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 64</a> at [11] to [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this regard, I noted that the Xiamen property had not been fully paid up – and thus had <em>not</em> been “acquired” – <em>before</em> marriage: s 112(10)(a). The remittance slips show that the Husband was still making payments for the property in December 2017 – i.e., one month after the marriage in November 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Next, I considered whether the Xiamen property was “acquired <em>during</em> the marriage” and thus constituted “matrimonial property” under s 112(10)(b). In my view, the answer is yes. <em>First</em>, there is no evidence to show that further remittances/payments had been made towards the acquisition of the Xiamen property after December 2017. <em>Second</em>, the Wife was able to sell the property in 2020 – during the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">C.    <u>Value of the Xiamen property</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having found that the Xiamen property is a matrimonial asset, I shall now determine its value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     According to the Records, the property was sold in <em>2020</em> for RMB 2 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband contended that (a) the recorded price of RMB 2 million is “fictious” and “below market value” and (b) the property should be valued at RMB 7 million instead. This valuation is based on transaction prices of similar units in 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I am unable to accept the Husband’s contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he had failed to provide any evidence to show why I should go behind the Records to find that the property had in fact been sold at a higher price of RMB 7 million. For instance, he did not produce any evidence to show that similar units were sold at that price in 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I found it to be unreasonable to value the Xiamen property based on prices in 2022 – i.e., <em>two years after it was sold</em> – given that property prices are known to be dynamic and sensitive to economic, political, and other considerations. In this context, I noted that the property was sold in 2020 – the year when the world was gripped by fears surrounding the COVID pandemic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">D.    <u>Division of the sale proceeds of the Xiamen property</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Having determined that the Xiamen property was sold for RMB 2 million, the next issue is how the sale proceeds ought to be divided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Applying the structured approach (see [8] and [9] above), I noted the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Direct financial contributions</em>. The Husband had contributed RMB 1,265,680 ($260,000) towards the acquisition of the Xiamen property. These contributions represent “over 70% of the purchase price” of RMB 1.8 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Indirect contributions.</em> There is no evidence that the parties had made any indirect contributions towards the Xiamen property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I found that it would be “just and equitable” for the Husband to be awarded $260,000 from the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Xiamen property was a “joint investment”. Most of the parties’ contributions towards acquiring the property were made before marriage. There is no evidence that the property had served as a matrimonial home, or that the parties had made indirect contributions towards it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the circumstances, it would be reasonable to divide the sale proceeds just like any other joint investments. In this regard, it is usual to divide such investments based on the parties’ respective contributions towards them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In this case, the Husband had contributed RMB 1,265,680 ($260,000) towards the Xiamen property. Applying the usual approach, the Husband should receive 70% of the sale proceeds of RMB 2 million – i.e., RMB 1.4 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband had requested the return of only his contributions of $260,000 (RMB 1,265,680) from the sale proceeds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This amount is <em>lower</em> than RMB 1,400,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Acceding to the Husband’s request would not cause the Wife to suffer any financial detriment. In fact, she would receive a windfall of RMB 134,320 (i.e., RMB 1.4 million minus RMB 1,265,680) from her joint investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Declared assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I shall now turn to the Husband’s assets.

These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46      <em>First</em>, her contention is contradicted by her own Statement of Claim for Divorce (Amendment No. 1). In this document (filed on <em>8 November 2023</em>), she had stated that she was employed as a beautician.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47      <em>Second</em>, on 9 April 2025, the Wife had been directed by an order of court to provide her bank statements from January 2024 to February 2025. These statements are material for two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>One</em>, they can show whether the Wife did or did not receive income from January 2024 to February 2025. If she did, then this can disprove her claim of unemployment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Two</em>, the bank statements can also show whether the Wife had dissipated matrimonial funds during the period when divorce proceedings are imminent: <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> at [24]; <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [68].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     On 11 June 2025, the Wife replied that she “declined to provide the monthly bank statements”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> She did not offer any explanation for refusing to comply with the court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     It bears emphasis that the Wife has a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all information relevant to the ancillary proceedings. This is especially so when there is a court order that has required her to provide specified banking information. In this case, she would have no difficulty complying with the court order. I infer that the only reason why she had intentionally refused to provide the banking information is because they would have contradicted her contention that she is unemployed: <em>Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0875.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 875</a> at [39]; <em>BPC v BPB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [60]. Accordingly, I found that the Wife is gainfully employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Next, I considered whether spousal maintenance should be ordered in this case. Generally, such maintenance is intended to serve two objectives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, to mitigate the financial impact of a divorce on a former wife: see s 114(2) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, to even out any financial inequalities between the parties which may exist after the division of matrimonial assets. Such inequalities may have arisen because of economic prejudice suffered by the former wife during the marriage: <em>Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 3 SLR(R) 0376.xml')\">[2004] 3 SLR(R) 376</a> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No order for spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Bearing in mind the applicable principles, I declined to order spousal maintenance for the Wife. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     At all material times, the Wife had been living in China – apart from the Husband. There is no evidence that the marriage had caused her to suffer any economic prejudice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the contrary, the Wife had been free to pursue her career and aspirations. She appears to have been able to take care of herself financially all this while. There is no evidence that she had required or received spousal maintenance during the eight years of her marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the above, there is no reason to believe that the divorce will cause her to suffer any financial detriment for which she will need financial assistance in the form of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     For the above reasons, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Each party is to retain her/her assets in their sole names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is to pay <b>$235,818.58</b> to the Husband within six months of this judgement.

There is no appeal against my order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The salient facts of the 12 charges</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I will set out in brief the salient facts of the 12 charges to which Ben pleaded guilty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900155-2025 – Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 5 March 2025, Ben and his friend, T met the victim and agreed to inhale ‘K-pod’ (a vaping device) together. When the victim did not agree to let T borrow his ‘K-pod’ device, a fight broke out. Both Ben and T punched and kicked the victim multiple times on the face, body and leg, causing the latter to fall to the ground. Even while the victim was on the floor, they continued assaulting him until he began bleeding from the mouth and nose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Ben and T then asked the victim if he had any valuables on him. The victim denied having any. Ben and T proceeded to search the victim’s pockets and threatened to slash him with a karambit knife if he did not cooperate (although no knife was actually produced). Ben then took the victim’s ‘K-pod’ device and fled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The victim sustained multiple injuries including a lip contusion and nasal bone fracture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Ben pleaded guilty to the offence punishable under section 394 of the Penal Code 1871 (the “Penal Code”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-9000264-2025 – Harassing a Public Servant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 1 May 2025, Ben’s mother, Madam Lee (<em>not her real name</em>) called ‘999’ stating that “My son is going crazy”. Two police officers were dispatched to respond to the incident report. Upon their arrival, Mdm Lee showed the police officers a vaping device and explained that her son had not been acting normally since using it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       One of the police officers (the “SPF officer”) noticed that Ben was agitated and asked him to sit down, upon which Ben shouted at him. The SPF officer noticed cuts on Ben’s legs and insisted that paramedics check on his injuries. Ben refused and continued to be aggressive, shouting vulgarities at the SPF officer during their exchange.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 6(1) of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014, punishable under section 6(3) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900361-2025 – Causing or contributing to risk of dangerous fire</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 29 September 2024, Ben had met four other friends to celebrate a birthday at the void deck of a block of HDB flats. One of the friends had brought a lighter to light the candles on the birthday cake. While the group was sitting around the table at the void deck, Ben used the lighter to set a pair of wooden chopsticks on fire and thereafter placed the burning chopsticks on the table, which caused the plastic tabletop to sustain damage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The police were alerted to this incident through a ‘999’ call about “a few teenagers playing with fire at the ground floor”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 285(1)(c) of the Penal Code, punishable under section 285(2)(b) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900362-2025 – Theft in dwelling house etc. with Common Intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 12 August 2023, Ben and another friend, H, were in a shop at Harbourfront Centre and took food and drinks with a total value of $40.20 without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Their actions were captured on CCTV. The store staff asked them to return the items in their hands. They complied and left the store. Upon reviewing the CCTV footage, the store staff realised that there was a further item which had been placed in H’s bag and not returned. The store staff subsequently called the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900368-2025 – Amalgamated Shop Theft</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On 25 June 2023, Ben took four packets of ‘Kinder Bueno’ chocolates valued at $9.40 from a supermarket without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 13 July 2023, Ben took a bottle of perfume valued at $140 from a shop at Nex without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On 9 April 2024, Ben took one pair of white socks valued at $5.90 from a shop at Nex without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On 20 May 2024, Ben took a Logitech G/MSE gaming mouse valued at $189 from a shop at Nex without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As such, Ben committed shop theft on four separate occasions under section 380 of the Penal Code, which taken together amounted to a course of conduct. He pleaded guilty to an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 which is punishable under section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC 9000380-2025 – Voluntarily Causing Hurt with Common Intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The victim was a 13-year-old male. On 24 July 2023, the victim’s aunt called ‘999’ to report that her nephew had been beaten up outside his school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The investigations revealed that after hearing that the victim had badmouthed Ben and two other youths, they confronted the victim and brought him to a staircase landing at a multi-storey carpark. They started assaulting the victim by punching, kicking and pushing him multiple times on the face and torso. This caused the victim’s head to be slammed against the floor and wall. He lost consciousness for approximately 10 minutes and when he regained consciousness, he vomited twice and suffered pain in his head, chest, back and abdomen. The victim had multiple superficial injuries to his left ear, left knee, chest and abdomen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900390-2025 – Theft with common intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On 5 February 2024, Ben and another youth, R, came across a listing on Carousell (an online platform) advertising a personal mobility device (“PMD”) battery for sale at $700. They came up with a plan to meet with the seller, take and flee with the PMD battery, without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Later in the evening on the same day, they met up with the seller. During the meeting, R requested to test the PMD battery before making payment. The seller agreed and handed the battery over to R, who installed it onto his electric scooter and instructed Ben to “test” the scooter. Ben then fled on the electric scooter with the PMD battery while R fled on foot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The seller gave chase and managed to intercept Ben. He instructed Ben to call R back and to make payment. However, Ben fled a second time on the electric scooter. In attempting to stop him, the seller held onto Ben’s arm and was dragged forward; this caused him to fall and sustain superficial cuts to the left side of his face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence of theft punishable under section 379 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YCN 900002-2025 to YCN 900006-2025 – Possession of vaporiser (i.e. vaping device)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Ben was found to be in possession of vaporiser(s) (i.e. vaping device(s)) at various locations on the following occasions: 4 February 2024, 19 March 2024, 30 May 2024, 9 June 2024, and 19 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     He therefore contravened section 16(3)(a) of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993; he pleaded guilty to 5 offences punishable under section 16(7) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision on the Appropriate Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Discussion on the law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The two-stage framework for dealing with youthful offenders was set out and elaborated in the case of <em>PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> (“<em>Boaz</em>”) (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In relation to the first stage, Sundaresh Menon CJ had observed in <em>Boaz</em> that there were four illustrative circumstances where the focus on rehabilitation may be diminished or even eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution. These are where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened or recalcitrant; or (d) the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable (see also <em>PP v CPS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32549-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 59</a>, at [4]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I note from the cases that the “primary sentencing consideration” of rehabilitation is generally <b><em>not</em></b> diminished or eclipsed when we consider the first stage of the framework in relation to the youth offenders dealt with by the Youth Courts. For example, in <em>PP v GFM</em> (a minor) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29557-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGYC 4</a> (“<em>PP v GFM”)</em>, when considering the first stage of the framework in <em>Boaz</em>, I had considered the youth’s relatively young age and her rehabilitative potential in concluding that rehabilitation should be the dominant consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1<sup>st</sup> stage - Rehabilitation being the dominant consideration</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Ella was only 13 years old when she committed most of the offences to which she pleaded guilty or for which she gave her consent to be taken into consideration in the determination of the outcome. At the time of the hearing before me, she had turned 14 years of age. Given her relatively young age, I was of the view that she does have rehabilitative potential. I therefore affirmed that I was guided by rehabilitation as the dominant consideration in determining the most appropriate order in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Following the case of <em>PP v GFM</em>, I have come more firmly to the view that the <b><em>focus</em></b> of the Youth Courts <b><em>must be</em></b> on rehabilitation of the children or young persons dealt with and found guilty by the Youth Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     First, the Youth Courts are mainly governed by the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (“CYPA”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Section 34(1)(b) of the CYPA mandates the Youth Court, when dealing with a child or young person brought before it, either as being in need of care and protection, or as an offender or otherwise, to “facilitate the protection and <b><em>rehabilitation of the child or young person</em></b>, and his or her reintegration with his or her family and with society”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Secondly, section 4(b) of the CYPA provides that “in all matters relating to the administration or application of the [CYPA], the welfare and best interests of the child or young person must be the first and paramount consideration”. This is the statutory guiding principle whenever a child or young person is the subject of consideration under the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, the principle of “best interests of a child or young person” in the context of the youth justice system should fundamentally centre only on rehabilitation and the child’s or young person’s present and future well-being. Such a “best interests” principle is in stark contrast to the societal aims of retribution and deterrence. When punishment is imposed primarily to send a message to others or to satisfy the public demands for retribution, the child’s or young person’s individual needs, circumstances and potential for positive change become secondary considerations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     When we consider what truly serves a child’s or young person’s best interests within the criminal justice system, the answer invariably points towards interventions that addresses the underlying causes of offending behaviour, develops his or her capacity for positive social engagement and maximises his or her successful reintegration into society. The rehabilitative approach recognises that children and young persons are still developing cognitively, emotionally and socially, making them particularly responsive to therapeutic and educational interventions rather than pure punitive measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Thirdly, the options available to the Youth Court in exercise of its power on proof of an offence under section 49(1) of the CYPA are generally rehabilitative in nature; this includes even those that are generally regarded as more ‘severe’ in nature such as the granting of orders to send the youth offender to a JRC (s 49(1)(i)) or to undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre (s 49(1)(k)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While a detention order (made under s 49(1)(g)) or a fine (imposed under s49(1)(j)) are not inherently rehabilitative, such orders have rehabilitative potential. Sitting as a Youth Court judge, I seldom grant a detention order on its own. The detention order, if granted, is normally paired with a probation order; this is because it is believed or assessed that such a combination of orders, in appropriate cases, will be <em>more effective in strengthening the resolve</em> of the youth offenders to turn over a new leaf and strive for positive change. As for fines, these are not normally imposed at all, but the rare cases in which fines were imposed would show that such an order had generally been made where the offence(s) were of a regulatory nature and/or the youth offender has a low risk of re-offending. The fines would signal to the youth offenders of such profiles that there are consequences to their actions in contravening the law and it would not always be the case that they are simply let off with a caution or a warning on account of their youth (as some of the youth offenders are wont to think), thereby building and strengthening their consequential thinking abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Before moving on to the appropriate order, I should make the observation that the focus on rehabilitation by the Youth Courts does not result in young persons who commit serious crimes receiving inappropriately lenient treatment. When young persons commit serious offences, they can still be dealt with by other courts of appropriate jurisdiction – rather than the Youth Courts – to ensure that the severity of their sentences or orders remain commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed. For example, under section 39(2) of the CYPA, where a child or young person is charged with any offence triable only by the General Division of the High Court, he or she <u>must</u> be tried by the General Division of the High Court unless (i) the Public Prosecutor applies to the Youth Court to try such offence; and (ii) the legal representative of the child or young person concerned consents to the offence being tried by the Youth Court. In due course, when the amendments to the CYPA to raise the upper age limit of young offenders dealt with by the Youth Courts to under 18 years old come into effect, those who are 16 to under 18 years old and commit serious offences or are repeat offenders may be dealt with by the District Courts or the General Division of the High Court; such cases may be transferred to a court of appropriate jurisdiction by the Youth Court on its own motion or upon receiving the necessary fiat in writing by the Public Prosecutor. As explained by the then Minister for Social and Family Development, Mr Desmond Lee at the second reading of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill, this was “intended as a deterrent that we are not soft on crimes, especially those of a serious nature and that there are times where firmer punishment of the offender is warranted, in spite of his youth”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The appropriate order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I would have been minded to direct for a probation suitability report to see whether it is suitable for Ben to be placed on probation as <em>his rehabilitative option</em>. The prosecution made no objections to the calling of a probation suitability report in Ben’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Ben’s mother, however, voiced out her helplessness in managing Ben’s behaviours at home. After a fuller discussion with her in the court session, I came to the determination that probation would not be a suitable option for Ben. Ben’s parents were divorced and his mother has sole custody, care and control of him. Ben’s father is currently serving a prison sentence; even if he had been involved in Ben’s life after the divorce, he would be in no capacity to help the mother in her supervision of Ben. There were also no other appropriate family members who could come alongside the mother to support Ben in the community. The lack of strong familial support and supervision does not bode well for a smooth and successful probation journey for Ben. This being the case, I was of the view that it may be more appropriate and in his best interests for him to be sent to a JRC i.e. the SBH, where he can undergo targeted programmes under the supervision and guidance of the professionals and youth case workers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Upon my invitation to submit on the appropriate length of the JRC order, the prosecution stated that it should be no less than 24 months given the nature and the multiplicity of the offences. Ben’s mother made no comments or remarks in reply, preferring to leave the order in the Court’s hands. I agreed with the prosecution’s position and thus made the JRC order of 24 months. I took the view that 24 months would be an appropriate duration, giving sufficient runway for the intervention programmes at the SBH to work and effect Ben’s rehabilitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I encouraged Ben’s mother to support him in his rehabilitation journey by visiting him and working closely with the officers at SBH. I also encouraged Ben to turn his focus back onto his studies and approach his residence at the SBH and the intervention programmes with a firm resolve for positive change and a cooperative spirit.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The youthful offender in <em>Boaz</em> was not dealt with by the Youth Court at first instance; therefore section 46(1) of the CYPA does not apply.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Section 35(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 provides that “A Youth Court has the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the Children and Young Persons Act 1993”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official report</em> (3 September 2019), Vol No 94, Sitting No 110</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-09-25","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1394 of 2024","title":"XSD v XSE","citation":"[2025] SGFC 102","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33902-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband in person and unrepresented","Tan Mao Lin (Jacque Law LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-10-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XSD v XSE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSD <em>v</em> XSE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33902-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 102</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1394 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">25 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband in person and unrepresented; Tan Mao Lin (Jacque Law LLC) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XSD — XSE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">25 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 1394 of 2024 (“SS 1394”) was the Wife’s application for a PPO against her Husband. I heard the trial and delivered judgment, allowing the Wife’s application in SS 1394. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed in her application, the Wife had to establish, on a balance of probabilities whether her Husband had committed family violence or whether her Husband was likely to commit family violence on her. The definition of family violence is set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 and includes:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In addition, the Wife must also establish, on a balance of probabilities, the necessity for a PPO. The crux of the inquiry here is that of a risk assessment. In other words, the court must consider the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence on the Wife in the future: see <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife’s complaint in SS 1394 revolves around an incident which took place on 22 July 2024. There was a dispute between the Wife and the Husband over the air conditioning. The Wife had turned to walk away. She alleges that the Husband pushed her. She fell onto her bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In his statement,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> the Husband admits that he lost control and pushed her at her back. He said he was tired after not having slept. His statement, that he had lost control, and pushed the Wife at her back, is again repeated in a document which he had filed containing his comments on the Wife’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I do not accept the Husband’s account, which he had given, in the course of his testimony, that he too had turned away as the Wife was turning away, and that when he did so, his hand had made contact with the Wife. His testimony given on the stand directly contradicts what he had previously stated in his statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He was given the opportunity to clarify this discrepancy, but did not do so. I find that his version of events, that he had in the course of turning away from the Wife, swung his hand which made contact with her, was an attempt to downplay what he had actually done to the Wife in this incident on 22 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having found that the Husband did lose control in that incident and pushed the Wife at her back, such an act, in my judgment, comes within the definition of family violence specifically limb (b) (<em>i.e.</em>, an act that causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also found that the Husband was likely to commit family violence against the Wife. For example, his daughter had testified that:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"16.94%\"><col width=\"83.06%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright.

So, what I can recall is he would call her names, he would demean her, he would criticise her, they will get into an argumentative match, and most of the time will be like a one-way conversation from his side. And---and then when it gets too heated, that’s when he will like resort to like physical like violence like laying his hand on her, such as like pushing her, and then there’ll be like slamming of the walls and storming around the house</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In addition to the daughter’s testimony, there was also the Husband’s own account of events. He described what had taken place when he had gone with the Wife on a tour to Eastern Europe sometime in 2019. He said the Wife had forgotten to close the hotel door. This made him upset. He was concerned that their belongings could be stolen. His response, however, is telling. Instead of settling what was, and what should have been, a private dispute between him and his Wife, he chose to make remarks to the rest of the tour group.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There is also the Husband’s evidence of what he calls a “shadow”. This is the Husband’s term for a group of people, or a force that he says, is influencing the Wife to act against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The inference which I draw from these three examples that I have cited, is that the Husband obviously views the Wife in a negative light, and even that is perhaps, somewhat of an understatement. In addition, I find that the Husband is also prone to outbursts and does not appear to have a healthy way of handling disputes or disagreements with his Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     To sum up I have concluded thus far that the Husband did commit an act of family violence against Wife in the incident on 22 July 2024. I have also found it likely that the Husband will commit family violence against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was noted in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39], that once the court has found it likely that a respondent will commit family violence against a complainant, it logically follows that a PPO is presumptively necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Leaving aside any presumption, I am satisfied, on the evidence before me, that a PPO is indeed necessary. Both the Wife and the Husband are still living together in the same flat. That they continue to share a common space will only provide fertile ground for further disputes to arise between the two of them. But beyond this, as I had earlier noted, the negative light in which the Husband views his Wife, their unhappy relationship, as well as how the Husband chooses to react when he is upset with his Wife are all factors that point towards, and reinforce the necessity of ordering a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore granted the Wife’s application in SS 1394 for a PPO. In addition, I also ordered both parties to attend counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As for costs, counsel for the Wife, Mr Tan, argued that because the Wife had succeeded in her application, costs should be fixed at $15,000 in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To justify the quantum of costs being fixed at $15,000, Mr Tan referred me to the case of <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) where the court had fixed costs at $5000. Mr Tan argued that the length of the trial before me (which was much longer than the hearing in <em>XFL</em>), the number of witnesses, and the Husband’s conduct were all factors justifying asking for costs in the quantum of $15,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband, however, disagreed with Mr Tan’s submission that he should have to pay costs of $15,000 to the Wife. He gave several vague reasons which ranged from being financially unable to pay such costs as he could not expect any support from his children, to the fact that he was dissatisfied with my decision to grant his Wife the PPO she sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Having considered parties’ arguments on costs, I ordered that costs be fixed at $14,000 (all-in). The starting point is that a successful party is entitled to costs. Given that the Wife had succeeded in her application, she was entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I saw no reason to exercise my discretion to depart from this starting point. In fixing costs at $14,000, I took into account, amongst other factors, the length of the trial, the number of witnesses and the conduct of parties. I also took into consideration the fact that there was a delay in the hearing of this matter. The trial had originally come up for hearing before me on 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2024. That hearing had to be adjourned because Mr Tan had just been appointed on the 26<sup>th</sup> of September 2024 to act for the Wife, and thus required time to take instructions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In particular, I would highlight that the Husband’s conduct was a factor that justified the award of a higher quantum of costs. To give an example, the Husband had, on the first day of trial, prior to the lunch break, said that he might also commit suicide.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given this, arrangements were made for a court counsellor to speak with the Husband. The Husband, however, shouted at the court counsellor and refused to engage with her. He had apparently taken offence at the fact that the court counsellor was female, and he was also frustrated as he was hungry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The above example was not merely an isolated incident. The Husband ignored repeated reminders to be mindful of his conduct in court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Such conduct on the Husband’s part, in my judgment, must be reflected in the quantum of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     For the reasons set out above, I fixed costs at $14,000 (all-in).</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force before 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Exhibit R2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Exhibit R4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Exhibit R2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at p 50.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>See Transcript, Day 2 at p 21.

Both parties were represented at the hearing before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband opposed her application. There were two prongs to his argument as to why the Wife should not be allowed to amend her SOP.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       First, that allowing these amendments would be akin to letting the Wife have a second bite at the cherry. That was because the Wife sought to amend her pleadings after she had sight of the Husband’s Defence. This was, according to the Husband, an attempt to “change the conduct of proceedings” after realising that they are “no longer progressing in her favour”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Second, that the Wife had lied in her supporting affidavit for SUM 2789. This spoke to the bona fides of her application to amend her pleadings. In the Husband’s words – an application “riddled in falsehoods is not an application made in good faith” – and for this reason too, the Wife’s application to amend her pleadings should fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The principles relating to the amendment of pleadings are well established and have been usefully summarised in <em>VQZ v VRA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26164-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 69</a> (“<em>VQZ</em>”) at [26] – [34]. The general principle is that parties are allowed to amend their pleadings provided that doing so is reasonably necessary to allow them to present their case, and that these amendments would not cause any injustice to the opposing party that cannot be compensated by way of costs: <em>VQZ</em> at [34].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Although the Wife’s application to amend her pleadings came after she had sight of the Husband’s Defence, this was not a good reason to disallow her application. As was noted in <em>VQZ</em> at [47], Rule 422 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 allows “for an amendment to be made at any stage of the proceedings, which must presuppose that an amendment may be allowed even after the other party has had sight of the Defence”. I would also add that any prejudice that the Husband suffered could be remedied by way of costs, and by allowing him to file a fresh Defence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I turn now to the Husband’s argument that the Wife’s application to amend was made in bad faith as she had lied in her supporting affidavit for SUM 2789. I take, as the starting point, the trite principle of law that “he who asserts must prove their case”: see <em>VQZ</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Insofar as the Husband alleges that the Wife had lied in her supporting affidavit, I do not find that he had made out this allegation. For one, the Husband refers to a set of three letters which the Wife’s previous solicitors had sent to him. He says that these letters refute what the Wife had set out at paragraph 7 of her supporting affidavit for SUM 2789. The Husband, however, did not exhibit the contents of these letters. Without these letters, it is impossible to assess what had actually been said and done. What was before me in both the Husband and the Wife’s affidavit was simply one party’s account of events against the other. I would add that the fact that the Wife did not file an affidavit in reply does not mean that the allegations which the Husband has levelled are true: <em>VQZ</em> at [57].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       That being said, I note that the Husband had, in his reply affidavit to SUM 2789, canvassed some of the contents of these letters to support his argument that what had been said in these letters showed that the Wife had lied in her supporting affidavit. Even taking this into account, I do not think it could be said that the Wife had lied in her supporting affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     First, the Husband points out that these letters had set out facts which the Wife’s then solicitors had proposed to be included in the SOP, and that there had been some toing and froing on the contents of the draft SOP.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     This appears to be consistent with what the Wife had set out in her affidavit for SUM 2789. She states that her then solicitors had “proposed a draft SOP” which briefly mentions facts suggesting “unreasonable behaviour”, but the divorce was premised on 4 years separation. Although the Husband says that the Wife had lied in that he never received any “draft SOP” – what I understand the Wife to be saying in her affidavit is that her then solicitors had tried to hash out, by way of letter, the contents of that draft SOP.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from this, the Husband also takes issue with the fact that the Wife had, in her supporting affidavit, given the impression that he would “agree to an interim judgment by consent on the SOP filed by the Wife”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I do not think this is an accurate characterisation of what the Wife had set out in her supporting affidavit for SUM 2789. She had merely stated that her solicitors had proposed crafting the SOP in a way that would minimise acrimony and discontent between both parties thereby allowing the divorce to proceed on an uncontested basis. It appears that the intention was to set out only the necessary details that would establish 4 years separation (though the Wife says these details also alluded to “unreasonable behaviour” on the Husband’s part). It was the Wife’s belief that crafting the SOP in such a manner would allow parties to agree to an interim judgment (“IJ”) without having to go through a contested divorce. I did not understand her to be saying that the Husband would agree to an IJ, or that either the Husband or his lawyers had behaved in such a way that indicated he would agree to an IJ on the basis of the SOP as filed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Finally, as to the Husband’s point that what was discussed in the letters was premised on 3 years’ separation instead of 4 years’ separation – I note that the Husband had stated that paragraphs 1(b), 1(c) and (d) of the SOP that had been filed were identical to the “particulars” as set out in the letters from the Wife’s then lawyers on 24 November 2023 and 13 December 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The facts set out at paragraphs 1(b), (c) and (d) of the SOP shows that parties had been separated since the start of January 2020. This means that at the time of the letters, parties had only been separated for more than 3 years. However, by the time the divorce was filed on 16 January 2024, parties would have been separated for more than 4 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I would not place much weight, if any, on the switch from divorce on the basis of 3 years’ separation to 4 years’ separation. As I have mentioned, without sight of these letters, it is difficult, if not impossible to fully understand what parties had discussed. This is all the more so when one considers the time period involved – at the time of these letters, it was clear that when the divorce was filed down the road, it could be done either on the basis of three years’ separation, or four year’s separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To sum up, the Husband had not established that the Wife had lied in her supporting affidavit for SUM 2789. There was therefore no basis to say SUM 2789 had been taken out in bad faith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, and for completeness, I add that the amendments which the Wife wishes to make to her pleadings are necessary to allow her to present her case as to what she says is the real reason behind the breakdown of the marriage. As I understood it, she wished to change the ground of divorce because the previous ground that she had proceeded on was done in the hopes that parties would be able to amicably resolve their differences and avoid an uncontested divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife’s application for leave to amend was therefore granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I heard parties on costs. Counsel for the Wife, Mr Jonathan Phipps, argued that costs should be fixed at $2000 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife, to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Alagappan s/o Arunasalam (“Mr Alagappan”) argued that the quantum of costs should instead be fixed at $3000 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Having regard to the matter, and the fact that substantial amendments would likely have to be made to the Husband’s pleadings, I fixed costs at $2500 (all-in) and ordered that this sum be paid by the Wife to the Husband.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit in Reply at [18].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit in Reply at [11].</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Family Violence"],"date":"2025-09-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1739 and 1847 of 2024","title":"XRX v XRY and another matter","citation":"[2025] SGFC 100","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33895-SSP.xml","counsel":["XRX in person and unrepresented","Mary Ong (DCMO Law Practice LLC) and Genesis Shen (RCP Law) for XRY."],"timestamp":"2025-10-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XRX v XRY and another matter</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XRX <em>v</em> XRY and another matter </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33895-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 100</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1739 and 1847 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XRX in person and unrepresented; Mary Ong (DCMO Law Practice LLC) and Genesis Shen (RCP Law) for XRY. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XRX — XRY </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Violence</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was a dispute between [XRX], and her aunt-in-law, [XRY].

Ms Ong had cited this case for what DJ Kow had said at paragraphs 66 and 67. She argued that these two paragraphs stood for the broader proposition that the fact that parties are no longer living together does not mean that a PPO is not necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was what DJ Kow had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">66    Finally, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home.<sup>[</sup><sup>note: 61]</sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">67    I am not persuaded by this submission. The fact that the parties are no longer residing together does not mean that family violence in the future is unlikely. In the present case, I note that the Wife appears to have a controlling personality and to tend to make inflammatory remarks towards the Husband over WhatsApp. This is evident, for instance, in the WhatsApp exchanges between the parties on 28 July 2023. The background to this exchange has already been set out in [5] to [16] above.<sup>[</sup><sup>note: 62] </sup>To recap –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The Husband told the Wife that her punishment of the son was unduly harsh – considering that it was just spelling. He had requested the Wife not to “overreact”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Despite the fact that the tone in the Husband’s messages was measured, the Wife responded with a barrage of accusatory statements. This included (i) asserting that the son’s poor performance was “definitely” due to the Husband’s “mistakes” (Message at 10.59 am), (ii) telling him “Don’t be stupid” (Message at 11.11 am), (iii) calling him an “irresponsible father who focus on money alone” (Message at 11.12 am), and (iv) scolding him, “shame on you” (Message at 11.15 am).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ms Ong’s submission overlooks what DJ Kow then went on to say in that judgment. DJ Kow had found that, although parties were no longer living together, there was still a likelihood of family violence being committed because of the inflammatory remarks the Wife would make to the Husband over WhatsApp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It was thus clear to me that DJ Kow was making a finding on the facts before him, and not laying down a broader proposition. I would also add that the facts before DJ Kow were, as will be apparent from my judgment, quite different from the present case before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The second case which Ms Ong had cited was one of my earlier decisions in <em>XMN v XMO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33260-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 54</a>. Ms Ong cited it for the proposition that “once family violence had been committed, there was a legal presumption that family violence is likely to be committed again in the future”. She referred to paragraph 17 of that judgment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17    Having found that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence, I turned to consider whether it was necessary to grant the PPO. In this vein, the law also says that once it is found that the Respondent is likely to commit family violence, a PPO is presumptively necessary: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [121] citing <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     That was not what I had said in that judgment. The presumption I was referring to in that case was that in cases where the court finds that the respondent is likely to commit family violence, there is a presumption that a PPO is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The third case Ms Ong cited was <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a>. She cited it for the same proposition – that once family violence had been committed, there was a legal presumption that family violence is likely to be committed again in the future. I did not understand the High Court to be laying down such a proposition in that case: see <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [40] – [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to set out the reasons for my decision, beginning with the applicable legal principles. As a preliminary point, both SS 1739 and 1847 were commenced prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2025. The applicable legislative provisions are to be found in the version of the Women’s Charter that was in force prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this connection, an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, the following two requirements, in order to obtain a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     First, that an act of family violence had been committed against the person sought to be protected, or that it was likely that family violence would be committed against the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Second, that it was necessary for the protection of that family member that a PPO be granted. In assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment as to the likelihood of family violence being committed in the future: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19] – [21]; <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [46]. In assessing the risk of family violence being committed in the future, the court considers factors such as the reasons for the family violence, whether the acts of family violence were recent occurrences, whether the family violence is a one-off occurrence, and whether there has been a material change in the parties’ living circumstances: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Apart from this, it is also important to note that such orders (<em>ie</em>, a PPO or a DEO) are meant to protect (<em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]). They are certainly not intended to be a tool to punish respondents for having committed acts family violence in the past. That is why applicants seeking a PPO must also demonstrate, to the court, that such an order is indeed necessary for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In this connection, the fatal flaw running through both applications in SS 1739 and 1847 is that neither XRX, nor XRY, have proven that it is indeed necessary for the court to order a PPO for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     XRX argued in her written submissions that it was necessary for her to be granted a PPO so that she will be able to “live without fear” and “sleep without anxiety” whilst rebuilding her “emotional stability” as she attempted to move on with her life after her divorce with her husband (“C”) had been finalised. XRX had also argued that any physical distance between her and XRY does not “erase the emotional control or the potential for ongoing harm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the other hand, Ms Ong and Mr Shen argued that a PPO was necessary given the fact that XRY was 84 years old, and in a frail physical state, and to allow XRY to have a peace of mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     None of the reasons given were good reasons as to why a PPO was necessary for the protection of either XRX or XRY. For one, while a PPO may have the effect of giving the protected person a peace of mind, that is not the purpose for which a PPO is granted. This is especially since there are serious consequences that may follow in the event a PPO is breached: see s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter 1961 which makes it clear that the breach of a PPO is an offence punishable by a jail term and/or a fine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Insofar as XRX suggests that a PPO was necessary to help her overcome the trauma and anxiety she had suffered from XRY’s alleged emotional control over her – I would observe that a PPO is not a balm to any wounds (both psychological or physical) that survivors of family violence may have endured. Healing will have to be found elsewhere. The point of such orders is to provide victims of family violence with a shield against future abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Insofar as XRX argues that a PPO is necessary, notwithstanding any physical separation between herself and XRY, I do not find that to be the case on the shape of the evidence before me. It was apparent, from the incidents that both XRX and XRY have complained of, that the friction and unhappiness between them arose from the both of them having shared a common space. After all, the incidents that both XRX and XRY had complained of occurred during a period of time where XRY lived together with XRX and C’s family and helped look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     That reality has since changed. Both XRX and XRY have moved out. They no longer share a common space. This physical separation between the two of them would minimise opportunities for further interaction, thereby depriving them of any fuel for further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Given that neither XRX, nor XRY, have proven the necessity requirement, it follows that their respective applications for a PPO in SS 1739 and 1847 must fail. Further, given that no PPO had been granted, XRX’s application for a DEO is also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for costs, Ms Ong argued that costs should be fixed at $5000, to be paid by XRX to XRY. On the other hand, XRX argued that parties should each bear their own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Given that neither party had succeeded in their respective application, I made no order as to costs for both applications.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Division of matrimonial assets – Variation of consent order"],"date":"2025-09-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OADV 125 of 2025","title":"XRO v XRP","citation":"[2025] SGFC 99","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33884-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Amy Lim (Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Applicant","Mr Loo Liang Zhi (Sterling Law Corporation) for the Respondent"],"timestamp":"2025-09-29T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XRO v XRP</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XRO <em>v</em> XRP </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33884-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 99</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OADV 125 of 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Amy Lim (Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Applicant; Mr Loo Liang Zhi (Sterling Law Corporation) for the Respondent </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XRO — XRP </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of consent order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties were married in August 2010 and have 2 children, A and B. The Applicant filed for divorce on 15 October 2019. Interim Judgment was made on 5 November 2019 which included consent orders in relation to two properties, Property 1 and Property 2, owned jointly by the parties. The judgment was made final in February 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This appeal concerns an application to vary paragraphs 3(d)(i) and 3(d)(ii) of the Interim Judgment made on 5 November 2019 which provided for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>Paragraph 3(d)(i) on Property 1</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1)    Property 1 shall continue to be leased out and the rental proceeds shall be utilised towards repayment of the mortgage loan and all costs and expenses of the said property including but not limited to property tax, agent's fees, management fees, insurance and repairs.

Any shortfall shall be borne equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2)    In the event that Property 1 is sold, parties shall have joint conduct of the sale.

The net value of the matrimonial flat shall be the market value of the matrimonial flat based on a valuation obtained through a private valuer appointed jointly by the parties, less the outstanding loan. The Applicant shall bear the costs related to the sale. The Respondent shall make the required CPF refunds from his 50% net value of the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">b.    in respect of Property 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Property 2 shall be sold on the open market within 6 months of the date of the Order of Court. The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">a.    To make full payment of the outstanding housing loan to the bank.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">b.    To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">c.    The balance sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 70% to the Applicant and 30% to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">d.    Parties shall pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF Rules and Regulations to their CPF accounts from their respective share of the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">e.    In the event that party's share of the sale proceeds are insufficient to pay the required CPF refunds to his/her own CPF accounts, that party shall be responsible for topping up the shortfall in cash to his/her own CPF account in one lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">f.    The Applicant shall have sole conduct of the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Respondent also sought that the Respondent shall pay the Applicant the difference between S$1.58m and the sale price, should the eventual sale price of the Property 2 fall below S$1.58m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Applicant filed the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Affidavit in support of application filed on 25 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Supporting affidavit filed on 3 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     2nd supporting affidavit filed on 18 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Respondent filed his affidavit in reply on 17 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Applicant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Applicant provided the following reasons for the variation for Property 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>c.     Applicant wished to purchase the Respondent’s 50% share to avoid similar disputes, ensured that he would receive his fair share without incurring additional costs, delays and uncertainties and provide a clear break for parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>d.     Applicant would like to be able to determine its future use.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Applicant provided the following reason for the variation of the order for Property 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>e.     She was solely responsible for managing it, including securing tenants, coordinating with agents, handling replacements, overseeing renovations, managing legal matters and payment of management and strata fees and property tax.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_f\"></a>f.     The Respondent only covered 30% of the monetary shortfalls and did not contribute time and effort to its management. As of 31 January 2025, there was an outstanding loan of $652,867.01. There had been financial shortfalls each month amounting to about $650 per month or $7,800 per year for which she had to bear 70% of the amount. The loss placed a significant financial strain on her, depleting her resources month after month. Selling it aligned with the terms of the interim judgment and it was prudent to have it sold. The current lease would expire in September 2025. She had received a favourable offer for $1.58 million and wished to proceed with the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_g\"></a>g.     The Respondent’s refusal was impractical, inequitable and inconsistent with the terms of interim judgement which gave the Applicant the predominant financial interest in its sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_h\"></a>h.     Applicant also wanted to reinvest and utilize funds that would benefit her and the children, example, funding the children’s private education. After the sale, she could establish a trust independently. The Respondent had not authority to dictate how she managed her share.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Respondent disagreed with the variation application in respect of the two properties as the parties intended to preserve the properties for the children’s future. The order provided these to be gifts to them if not sold. He proposed that if sold the proceeds should be placed in a trust or custodial accounts for the children financial needs. Alternatively, the properties should be maintained for their potential appreciation in value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The counsel for each party submitted written submissions and the matters set out below at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On behalf of the Applicant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_i\"></a>i.     in respect of Property 1, she wished to have the property bought over at market value based on valuation by an independent valuer;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_j\"></a>j.     in respect of Property 2, the clause was unworkable as it did not state when the property was to be sold and suggested that this should be by agreement. It was reiterated that the rental income was insufficient for the parties to hold on to the property. The property should be sold for parties to have a clean break.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_k\"></a>k.     In respect of Property 2 it was pointed out that though the clause provided for the proceeds to be divided 70:30 in favour of the Applicant, there was a dispute as to whether the division should be before or after CPF refunds<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Applicant sought to vary the sequence of the CPF refunds such that these refunds were made after the division of the proceeds of sale based on 70:30 apportionment in favour of the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_l\"></a>l.     The Applicant’s counsel submitted that the Applicant had wanted to have the CPF refunded after division. In view of that she had agreed to the following “adjustment” clause which reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">In the event the amount refunded to the Respondent 's CPF account exceeds 30% of the sale proceeds less Items (a) and (b), the Respondent shall pay the Applicant a sum equivalent to the said difference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Applicant’s counsel explained that when the order was agreed, the property was worth about $1 million<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. However, the clause did not contemplate a situation when the property value and sale price would significantly appreciate. Counsel also pointed out that there was a separation deed contemplated and other surrounding circumstances which supported the Applicant’s contention that the parties intended for the division of proceeds be 70:30 before CPF refunds in favour of the Applicant. One of the circumstances concerned the Applicant agreeing to the parties’ overseas properties be transferred to the Respondent without any compensation made to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On behalf of the Respondent, it was also submitted that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_m\"></a>m.     It was dangerous to decipher parties’ intention which led to the consent order. What was evident was that parties took at least one month to decide on the matter and what parties had contemporaneously agreed to were as set out in the court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_n\"></a>n.     The effects of the variation application for Property 2, if allowed were different from those consented to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In deciding the application , the legal provisions and authorities set out below were considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Under sections 112(1) and 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961, the Court has the power to vary the orders for division of assets. The provisions read:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112.—(1)    The court has power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In relation to orders made by consent, in <em>XNG v XNH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33284-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 32</a> the Court stated (at [9]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A consent order occupies a slightly higher elevation of authority because it is an order that both parties have forged together. It has the additional alloy of a contract and, therefore, more is required before a court will vary the order in question. It will not be enough to show that a consent appears unjust. This is because justice between the parties is sometimes a matter between them, and a court may not be able to revise an agreement entered into between parties who have decided in their wisdom how much to give and how much to take from each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The principles to be applied for variation of ancillary orders are set out by the Court of Appeal’s case of <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0068.xml')\">[2012] SGCA 68</a>. The Court of Appeal also clarified the threshold required for a court to intervene and vary orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets. At [23] the Court made it clear that there should be a “fundamental importance of finality” which applies in the context of division of assets. The Court would make, inter alia, the necessary variations to an order for division only when the order was unworkable or has become unworkable (but before it has been fully effected or implemented). There could be situations where a court order has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances which have arisen. However, the change in question must be “very rare and very extreme” (at [26]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In relation to parties who are legally represented, in <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19150-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 41</a>, the Court of Appeal stated that any agreement in relation to the issue of division of assets which has been freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties upon legal advice should be almost determinative of the outcome and the role of the court “is greatly circumscribed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for dismissal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Applicant’s application was dismissed for the reasons set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In respect of Property 1, as mentioned above, the Applicant wished to purchase the Respondent’s 50% share to avoid similar disputes, ensured that he would receive his fair share without incurring additional costs, delays and uncertainties and provide a clear break for parties. The Applicant would like to be able to determine its future use.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I was of the view that the above reasons did not amount to a material or radical change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In respect of Property 2, the Applicant main reason for seeking a variation was that she had been suffering shortfalls in the net income received of $650 per month. Her 70% share of this amount came up to $455 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Applicant had agreed to take on the obligation to maintain the property and in return, 70% of the net income would be retained by her whilst the remaining 30% be the Respondent’s share if there had been net profit. Any net loss would have to be shared in the same proportion. As the property was to be rented out, she would have anticipated that there would be occasions where the property would be vacant or rented at a loss in which case, a net loss was to be expected . I did not find that the $455 she had to incur each month caused a financial burden on her as claimed .</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For a court to vary an ancillary order, it could also be shown that the order was unworkable. I was of the view this was not the case here for both properties. The order has been in operation for 5 years. In these 5 years, the properties had increased in value and to continue maintaining the properties, the Applicant had adhered to what had been agreed. It is not open to her now to claim that the order had been unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was also of the view that the reasons given were not sufficient to amount to a radical or material change in the circumstances in respect of Property 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In addition to the above reasons, I was of the view that variation of the order should not be allowed for the following additional reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The real effect of the varying clause 2 in respect of Property 2 was that the Respondent would be disadvantaged if the division of the proceeds were made before CPF refunds. This would be an injustice to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The order was made with the consent of the parties. The court in <em>XNG v XNH</em> stated that it would not be enough to show that a consent appears unjust. While the Applicant claimed that the effect of the division after the sale of Property 2 would mean she would be receiving a lesser share than she had anticipated, this is a matter between the parties and, using the words of the court in XNG’s case, the court “may not be able to revise an agreement entered into between parties who have decided in their wisdom how much to give and how much to take from each other.”. I was of the view the Applicant would have to stand by what she had agreed to in the consent orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant was legally represented in the proceedings involving the division of the ancillary matters and would have been advised on the implications of the order she has consented to. While the Applicant had explained that the clauses, including the adjustment clauses were made on the basis that there was to be either a loss or no increase in the value of properties, there was no reason why the Applicant could not have insisted or provided for a separate adjustment clause in the event that the properties increase in value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The variation sought to have the two properties sold would detract from the parties’ original intention which was to have the 2 properties gifted to the 2 children if not sold. There was no reason for the departure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion and costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the reasons given, the application was dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Respondent estimated the disbursements incurred to be in the region of $800 to $1,000. The sum of $4,000 was sought by the Respondent while the Applicant proposed $1,000 as there was only 1 reply affidavit filed by the Respondent. Having regards to the work done to resist the application, I fixed cost of $2,500 to be paid to the Respondent.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This was in relation to Clause 2) for Property 2, specifically: “(c) To make the requisite CPF refunds to parties' respective CPF accounts; (d) The net proceeds shall be divided at 70% to the Applicant and 30% to the Respondent”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 54 of Applicant’s written submissions.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Evidence – Adverse Inference"],"date":"2025-08-12","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 34 of 2024","title":"XQF v XQG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 83","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33677-SSP.xml","counsel":["Yap Teong Liang with Russell Huang Liang Jun for the Wife (T L Yap Chambers LLC)","Low Jin Liang with Chloe Chua Kay for the Husband (PKWA Law Practice LLC)."],"timestamp":"2025-09-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XQF v XQG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQF <em>v</em> XQG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33677-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 83</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 34 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">12 August 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Yap Teong Liang with Russell Huang Liang Jun for the Wife (T L Yap Chambers LLC); Low Jin Liang with Chloe Chua Kay for the Husband (PKWA Law Practice LLC). </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XQF — XQG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Evidence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Adverse Inference</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">12 August 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is an appeal against the ancillary orders made upon divorce between the Plaintiff (“Wife”) and the Defendant (“Husband”). On 24 June 2025, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>a)     The parties shall have joint custody of the child with care and control to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>b)     Access:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>i)       Supervised visitation to be carried once a week for 2 hours at a family service centre for 8 sessions after which a report will be prepared by the centre for the court’s consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>ii)       Both parties will attend counselling on managing familial conflict and child’s well-being.

On 3 January 2024, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings on account of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. On 5 January 2024, the Husband filed a counterclaim on account of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Interim Judgment was granted on the claim and counterclaim on 20 May 2024 after a period of 4 years and 7 months of marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits and Submissions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 August 2024 (“PAOM1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 January 2025 (“PAOM2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 March 2025 (“PAOM3”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 August 2024 (“DAOM1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 January 2025 (“DAOM2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 March 2025 (“DAOM3”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife and Husband submitted their respective written submissions on 30 April 2025. The ancillary matters were heard on 7 and 15 May after which clarifications were sought on certain issues before the decisions were made on 24 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child’s maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The power of the court to order maintenance for children is found in section 127 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Section 127(2) provides that the provisions of Parts 8 and 9 apply to such applications with the necessary modification. Section 68 provides that a parent has the duty to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regards to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof. Under section 69(4), the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters set out in the subsection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Income</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife did not seek any maintenance for herself and only sought reasonable maintenance for the child who was about 2 years old at the time of the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife was a business development manager earning an average salary of $13,266 and a monthly net salary of $10,387. The Husband was a legal affairs manager earning an average salary of $14,490 and a monthly net salary of $10,732.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband submitted that his monthly expenses amounted to $12,584.42 which exceeded his net salary. The Wife argued that his monthly expenses were inflated to project an impression that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain the child. She extracted his breakdown of expenses and set out her replies against each item to show the expenses were either exaggerated, speculative and devoid of evidence or supporting documents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. His monthly expenses included anticipated expenses post-divorce for mortgage which was stated as $4,000 and utility bill of $100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife submitted that her personal expenses amounted to $6,649.40.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Having

he did not have sufficient funds to maintain the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Wife submitted the following computation for

Medical Insurance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The sum claimed was $205.56 which I rounded up to $206. As the policies were meant to provide for the child, I allowed this expense item as part of the child’s maintenance. The Defendant agreed with this expense item. However, the Husband raised a concern on one of the 3 policies, the AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Arising from a query by me at the 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing on 15 May 2025, the Wife’s solicitor clarified by his letter of 22 May 2025, that this item comprised of the following policies which were payable annually:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     AIA Healthshield Max B (Hospitalisation) - $249.31.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     AIA Max VitalHealth B (Hospitalisation) - $195.81.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV) with critical illness rider - $2,017.50 ($1,185 + $832.50 Rider Premium).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The total for all 3 policies came to $2,462.62 per year or $205.22 monthly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband’s solicitor, in his letter of 22 May 2025 informed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> policy “<em>is a life insurance policy which name the (Wife) as the sole owner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the payout or any surrender value (should the (Wife) decide to surrender the policy at any time as is her right as the sole policy owner) will go to only the (Wife) in the event of Death, Total Permanent Disability, and Critical Illness. In the event of any untoward event that happens to the child, the attendant expenses will be borne equally between the parties, regardless of the quantum of the payout under this policy or to whom the payout is made</em>”. The Husband was thus of the view that the child’s interest is safeguarded without requiring this policy or for half the costs which was to be borne by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband’s point was that the policy was not a wealth accumulation plan but to provide coverage for Death, Permanent Disability and Critical Illness and while the main policy has a surrender value, the surrender value would only surpass the total premiums paid after at least 30 years into the policy. I found the Husband’s concern a valid one. To address this, I made the following additional order in respect of item 2 which included the insurance policy concerned:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the event of any payout or surrender of the AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV)being made to the Wife instead of for the benefit of the child, the Wife shall handover 50% of the amounts received to the Husband with 14 days of such receipt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 3. Medical and Dental</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It was submitted by the Husband that these were being paid under the parties’ employment benefit. In view of that I made separate orders for such payments. For the medical and dental expenses, I ordered that the Husband pays 50% of the expenses not claimable by any of the parties’ employment benefit, payable on reimbursement basis within 7 days of any request to pay from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 4. Utilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I reduced the amount claimed from $100 to $60 for the child since for the helper, an adult, I assessed $100 as a reasonable amount. Further, on weekdays the child would be in pre-school half the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 5. Books, Diapers, Baby Bibs, Wet Wipes, Clothes, Shoes, Vitamins, Supplements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the child had grown older, some items such as bibs and diapers need not be purchased. I allocated $200 as a reasonable amount as the Wife also had to purchase new clothes and shoes as the child grows older.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The total for child expenses child excluding medical and dental expenses came to $433.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Items 6 to 13. Helper related expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I found the quantum claimed justified. The total amount for all the items came to $1,541. However, since the child was in pre-school during half of the weekdays, the helper would likely be doing other household chores for the Wife. In view of that, I attributed 80% of the total $1,541 to the child which is $1,232. 50% of this amount was to be paid by Husband which came to $616.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The total maintenance payable by the Husband for the child’s maintenance came to $1,049 ($433 plus $616) and rounded up to $1,050, to be paid with effect from 1 June 2025.

As there were limited vacancies and the Wife had exhausted all efforts to reach an agreement with the Husband, she registered the child with the preschool of her choice which commenced in February 2025. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband was only willing to provide pre-school fees up to the cost of an equivalent programme at the school named by him. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I came to the view that the Wife was justified in proceeding to enrol the child with the private school for pre-school at a cost of $1,465.38 per month.

that all be pooled together and divided based on the structured approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the assets other than the Apartment should be retained in the respective parties’ sole name?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife stated that during the marriage, their financial arrangements were that each of them kept separate finances, bank accounts and investments except for the housing mortgage and household expenses such as groceries and utilities which each of them contributed equally<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. In view of that, they never opened a joint account together and conveniently used the bank account (called the Household Account) that was opened for the housing loan payment and the household expenses. The account was topped up by the parties whenever it got low.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband confirmed the above arrangements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. With respect to the Household Account, although it was in the Wife’s name, they had always treated it as a joint account, as the common understanding was that the monies in the Household Account were also to be used for household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife further stated that throughout the marriage, she had suggested to the Husband a couple of times to do “combined investments” but he did not want to do so and informed her that he much preferred to do his own separate investments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. The Wife was fine with this. It also dawned on her that another reason that the Husband wanted to keep his finances separate was because he wanted the financial freedom to do what he wanted such as gambling at poker, drinking, and by keeping his finances separate, she did not get to track his finances at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Husband confirmed that the Wife did suggest that they make “combined investments”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. However, he was not keen to do so and preferred to do his separate investments as “combined investments” did not present any additional financial benefits when compared to making separate investments. They also had different investment strategies, and he did not want to create more conflict between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In relation to the insurance policies, when the Wife suggested investing together such as purchasing a wealth accumulation insurance policy as a form of education savings and planning for the child, the Husband vehemently disagreed and told her that when it was time, they could just contribute the necessary amounts required for the child’s education<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband also confirmed that the Wife did suggest purchasing a wealth accumulation insurance policy for the child but was insistent on accumulating an excess of $1 million for that purpose whereas he preferred to invest in a diversified and balanced portfolio of various instruments which could accumulate more wealth for both the child’s educational and the household needs<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Based on the above evidence, on behalf of the Wife, it was submitted that all the investments made by each party were from their respective income which were never shared with each other and kept separate. One example given was that the Wife did not know about the large sums that the Husband spent on gambling and that he had indulged in cryptocurrency investments which the Wife considered as risky. The Wife also claimed that the Husband had not been financially prudent in managing his assets as he had used his personal income for his own gambling hobbies and other investments without the Wife’s knowledge. Each of them did not make any financial or non-financial contribution towards their respective accumulation of assets/investments. As such it would be unfair and inequitable for the Husband to have a share in the Wife’s investments which were all kept separate in the same manner that the Husband had kept his separate to himself. Each party thus should retain all other assets in their respective names and that only the Apartment should be divided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Wife relied on section 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to support her contention that in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1), the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case. Section 112 reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112.—(1)    The court has power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The provision empowers the court to order the division of assets upon divorce. The Wife relied on the case of <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> [2007] 2 SLR (R) 729, wherein the Court of Appeal said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“26.  Thus, it is not mandatory for the court to exercise its powers of division under s 112 and the court may generally decline to do so where a valid reason is given: <em>Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 3 SLR(R) 0902.xml')\">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 902</a> at [31]. For the reasons given above, the present case is one in which there is good reason for the court not to divide Malvern Springs.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In Ong Boon Huat Samuel’s case, the wife who originally agreed to purchase a property with the husband withdrew her consent after they separated and left the purchase to the husband to purchase it in his own name. The wife’s application to have a share of the property failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Having considered the evidence and the law, I found merits in the Wife’s arguments. However, I was of the view that only the investment items should be left in the parties’ sole name and these comprised of the shares, unit trust and insurance policies for the Wife and for the Husband, the shares, unit trust and his cryptocurrency investments.

Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an ‘uplift’ to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, <em>inter alia</em>, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Court of Appeal further elaborated that indirect contributions, being a question of impression and judgment, is not to be determined mathematically but based on “all the relevant facts” of the case (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The following assets, in addition to the Apartment, were added to the total pool of assets for distribution which included the legal fees paid out by each party to their solicitors prior to interim judgment:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.6532693461308%\"><col width=\"33.1733653269346%\"><col width=\"33.1733653269346%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife ($)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband ($)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Bank accounts</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">86,318.43</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">73,981.89-UOB One</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0.24 -

Without giving an assessment of the valuation of that unit, the valuer concluded that the parties’ unit is valued at $2,685,000. I found his comparison to the other unit and the parties’ unit perplexing.

The Husband disputed that the amount was $816,000 and claimed that the amount should be $616,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">$200,000 purported as a gift to the Wife by parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife maintained a loan spreadsheet relating to the Apartment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. On 22 October 2022, there was a record of the Wife having made a repayment of $200,000 for the loans made by the parents. The Husband submitted that there were no such transactions in any of the Wife’s bank accounts and claimed that the Wife had an undisclosed bank account. The Husband invited the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Wife for the non-disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The law on drawing adverse inferences was succinctly summarised by the Court of Appeal in <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52834-M.xml')\">[2007] SGCA 21</a> at [28] and followed in subsequent cases including <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a>. In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Further, when informed that the $200,000 deduction was made as the Wife’s parents had gifted her 2 separate sums of $100,000, the Husband claimed that the $200,000 were also gifted to him and should be shared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The issue to be determined was whether the Wife had undisclosed bank account and whether the $200,000 gifted by the Wife’s parents to the Wife was intended to be shared with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Wife disclosed that a $100,000 gift was given to her by her parents on account of their 37<sup>th</sup> anniversary on 17 January 2023 and a further $100,000 by her father on his 61<sup>st</sup> birthday in March 2023. Her father had asked that these 2 gifts be reflected into the loan spreadsheet to be dated 14 March 2023. The Wife indicated the $200,000 loan to her parents as being paid as at 22 October 2022 in the loan spreadsheet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     She explained that these two gifts were non-cash transactions to her which were set off against the outstanding parent’s loans extended and thus not reflected in her bank statements. She produced her father’s WhatsApp message of 17 January 2023 which was sent only to her and another WhatsApp message for the next $100,000 gift<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     On the evidence, I accepted the Wife’s version as to how the $200,000 came about. I found it unlikely that the Wife’s parents had intended that the $200,000 be a gift to be shared with the Husband. If so, her parents would have also sent the same WhatsApp message or a separate one to the Husband but that was not the case here. The messages also clearly indicated that the gift was for the Wife solely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     On the evidence, I was also satisfied that there was no undisclosed bank account as alleged by the Husband. As such I declined to draw any adverse inference against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">iii)   Account for wedding monies received </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Husband also sought to have the monies (referred to as “Ang Pows”) received by the Wife at their wedding held in 2019, to be included in the pool of assets. According to her, parties had also agreed to keep their respective wedding gifts and continue to hold separate accounts for their respective personal assets. They had agreed to have separate boxes for monies gifted at their wedding and to keep the monies received separate. She informed that the monies received by her were deposited into her bank account and used in the course of the marriage. All her bank accounts have been disclosed during the discovery<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     I accepted that the Wife would have deposited the monies into her bank accounts and these were accounted for.

In deciding the indirect contributions, I came to the following views:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_i\"></a>i)     The Wife was the main caregiver of the child from birth till interim judgment, that is, from 2 April 2023 to 20 May 2024, which was slightly over 1 year, even if the presence of the helper should be taken into account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_ii\"></a>ii)     During the marriage and before the child was born, the Wife’s indirect contributions were more than the Husband’s from a comparison of the accounts given by both in their respective affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii\"></a>iii)     The Wife should also be given credit for her efforts in acquiring the Apartment which has appreciated in value from the purchase price of $1.8 million to $2.6 million which the Husband also stood to benefit from. In this respect, I noted the following efforts made by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii-p3_a\"></a>a)       The Wife’s sole determination to purchase the property despite the Husband’s reluctance as he was only willing to purchase either a cheaper condominium or a public flat (a Housing and Development Board flat). He had stated that the Wife insisted of a property which has also potential for capital appreciation. She had bought the property in her sole name and also took the risk of taking the maximum loan possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii-p3_b\"></a>b)       Parties could not afford the apartment on their respective incomes but through the Wife’s sole effort, she managed to obtain a substantial interest free loan from her parents. The Husband disclosed that the Wife had unilaterally discussed with her parents the issue of financial aid from them, the form such financial aid would take, and eventually the terms of the loans from her parents. Her parents loaned them $951,197 for the apartment. Her efforts saved the parties interest payments of $160,000 for the 5 years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In relation to property investment decisions, in <em>UJF v UJG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21382-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 1</a>, the party concerned was given credit as indirect contributions (at [108]). In that case, the Wife was the party who was primarily involved in making property investment decisions. The Court stated (at [109]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The exercise of these skills on a general basis throughout the marriage is to my mind sufficient to qualify as “indirect financial contributions” (see <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [24]). I am not aware of any case law that would point against this. Recognising such decision-making as a form of indirect contribution, captures the effort and skill exercised by the spouse in question, which contributes to the welfare and prosperity of the family just as much as other efforts. But it should be borne in mind that not all such decisions would necessarily be recognised; much will depend on facts, including the number of occasions of the decision-making or deliberation, and the amount involved each time. One-off decisions, or a few decisions done over a long period of time, is unlikely to qualify for recognition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     While the marriage was short lived and lasted 4 years 7 months to the time of the interim judgment, based on the above, the Wife’s indirect contributions in acquiring the matrimonial home was significant and with her other indirect contributions, I assessed them to be 60% with most part of it being attributed to her efforts in securing the Apartment and the interest free loans from her parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

The parties are divorced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The application was filed on 6 September 2024. The Mother was represented by counsel in these proceedings, while the Father was in person. Having heard the parties’ evidence and submissions on 30 April 2025 and 19 May 2025, I reserved my decision to 26 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I found that the Father had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the five children and therefore made maintenance orders. I set out the full grounds of my decision below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties are 36 years old. They were married for 13 years. In that time, they had five children, now aged 12, 10, 8, 6 and 5 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The parties were divorced pursuant to a decree granted by the Syariah Court on 31 January 2024. The orders on the ancillary matters were made by consent. The parties were given joint custody of the five children, with care and control of the children to the Mother. The Father was given reasonable access to the children, including overnight access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother waived her claims to <em>nafkah iddah</em> and <em>mutaah</em> in the divorce. In respect of the matrimonial assets, the parties’ matrimonial flat (the “Flat”) was to be transferred to the Mother with no CPF refunds made to the Father’s CPF account and the parties were to retain all other assets in their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       After the divorce, the Mother remarried. The children continued living with her in the Flat. Meanwhile, the Father moved in with his parents and brother. Though the parties had arranged for the Father to have weekly day access with the children, he was not always able to exercise access due to the demands of his job. On the average, he was able to see the children around three times a month. This usually took place on Sundays, from 8.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“WC”) encodes the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of their children. Section 69 of the WC confers on the court the power to make a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Section 69(2) of the WC sets the legal threshold a complainant must satisfy before the court makes a maintenance order. Under this provision, the Mother must first prove that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. There are two aspects to this enquiry. First, an assessment of what comprises “reasonable maintenance” as a monetary sum based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Second, an enquiry as to whether reasonable provision had been made for such maintenance (<em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> (“<em>UHA</em>”) at [44]-[45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The court may consider the question of “reasonableness” in several ways, such as the reasonableness of the expenses in question, whether one party reasonably communicated the needs or expenses to the other party, and whether the paying party used a reasonable mode of provision of maintenance (<em>UHA</em> at [46]-[50]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When assessing the reasonableness of the expenses, the law does not require that every expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. However, more exceptional expenses, such as certain medical needs and costs, should be sufficiently supported by evidence (<em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (“<em>UEB</em>”) at [13]). The fact that an item of expenditure has been incurred by a party for the child does not necessarily mean it is a reasonable expense for which maintenance should be ordered. A unilateral decision by one party to incur such expenditure does not mean that the law will compel the other party to contribute to that expenditure (<em>WLE v WLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a> at [21]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     If neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance is established, the court will then consider the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid and the mode of provision. In this regard, Section 69(4) of the WC sets out the factors that the court may consider when ordering maintenance. The court typically considers the financial needs of the children against the parties’ respective financial circumstances such as their income, means and expenses in assessing the appropriate amount of maintenance to be ordered. While both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and financial capabilities (<em>UHA</em> at [36]; <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [41]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There were three broad issues to be determined in the present case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, whether the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, if the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children, what was the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, if a maintenance order should be made, what mode of provision of maintenance would be reasonable in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the outset, I disallowed the claim for the outstanding mobile bill of $405.09 allegedly incurred by the Father. As counsel for the Mother conceded, this fell outside the scope of an application for child maintenance under Section 69(2) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother claimed that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the five children since 5 June 2024. She sought from the Father monthly maintenance of $500.00 per child, totalling $2,500.00 per month. She also sought maintenance for the following additional expenses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $350.00 per annum for Hari Raya Puasa expenses, based on a breakdown of $70.00 per child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $600.00 per annum for end-of-year school expenses, based on a breakdown of $200.00 for each of the older three children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A one-time reimbursement of $4,000.00 for the youngest child’s ongoing eczema treatment at a private clinic;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     A one-time reimbursement of $919.39 for 50% of the fees incurred by the oldest child when using a mobile phone application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     A one-time reimbursement of $405.09 for an outstanding mobile phone bill allegedly incurred by the Father on a mobile phone line under the Mother’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Regular expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother asserted that the monthly expenses for the five children came up to $3,318.00,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and submitted that this sum should be apportioned between the parties based on their relative incomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     She argued that the Father was financially capable of providing $2,500.00 per month for all five children and pointed to the fact that the Father had provided $2,250.00 per month from February 2024 to May 2024. She highlighted that the monthly maintenance provided by the Father had thereafter “<em>continuously declin[ed]</em>” as follows: $2,000.00 in June 2024, $1,750.00 in July 2024, $1,800.00 in August 2024, $1,500.00 in September 2024, $1,000.00 in October 2024 and $1,000.00 in November 2024. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s position was that $1,000.00 per month was adequate maintenance for the five children when they were in the Mother’s care. This was based on his calculation that the Mother only required $500.00 for food, based on a breakdown of $25.00 per day on weekdays, and $500.00 for miscellaneous expenses, given that some of the children’s school and education related expenses, including school meals, were covered by financial assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This maintenance of $1,000.00 per month was in addition to the monthly sum he directly paid toward the children when they were in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father argued that maintenance for any necessary expenses incurred by the Mother above the sum of $1,000.00 per month should then be paid on a reimbursement basis. This was to ensure that the sums paid would be used for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Mother disagreed with receiving payments on a reimbursement basis given the acrimony between the parties, and argued that fixed monthly and annual payments were preferred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Youngest child’s medical expenses </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It was undisputed that the youngest child suffered from severe eczema. The Mother claimed that the child required special medical treatment for the condition, which could only be provided at a private clinic. The cost of the treatment, including medication, incurred from 31 August 2024 to 23 April 2025 amounted to $8,802.84.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Mother argued that the Father ought to cover at least half of the expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother explained that the child had previously received treatment at a public hospital which had been ineffective. The private clinic, on the other hand, offered a wet wrap therapy treatment that led to what she described as a “<em>massive improvement</em>” in the child’s condition.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She claimed that the treatment was only offered by that clinic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father disputed the necessity of the treatment at the private clinic. He argued that the cost of the treatment was excessive and took the position that treatment at a government-subsidized hospital would have sufficed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Oldest child’s mobile phone expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother sought assistance from the Father for purchases made by the oldest child through the Google Play Store, totaling $1,838.78. The purchases were made on a mobile phone line under her name. She explained that she had not authorized the purchases and claimed to have unsuccessfully requested a refund.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father acknowledged that this was not the first time the oldest child had incurred such an expense and shared that refunds were successfully obtained for previous transactions. However, he argued that he should not be responsible for the current expenses as they had been incurred when the oldest child was in the Mother’s care and control. In response, the Mother claimed that some of the transactions had taken place while the child was under the Father’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Father neglected or refused to pay reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The first issue was whether the Father had been paying a reasonable sum toward the children’s reasonable expenses, or whether there had been neglect or a refusal on his part to do so (<em>UHA</em> at [46]-[47]). This turned on my assessment of the parties’ respective financial circumstances and the children’s reasonable expenses as what constitutes a “reasonable sum” must be considered within this context.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ income, means and liabilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother worked as a procurement officer. Her net monthly salary from July 2024 to December 2024 was $2,280.27. She declared that she had two bank accounts: an account in her sole name with a balance of $1,398.53, and an account jointly owned with the third child, with a balance of $1,450.92 (as at December 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father worked as a traffic controller.

In arriving at these amounts, I took into consideration the fact that the three older children attending primary school were receiving financial assistance which covered miscellaneous fees, free textbooks, free school attire and subsidies for school meals. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Annual expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Mother had asked for maintenance for two types of annual expenses – end-of-year school expenses and Hari Raya related expenses. There appeared to be an overlap in the Mother’s claims for the children’s year-end school expenses and monthly school expenses as both seemed to cover ad-hoc school expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I therefore allocated a monthly sum of $20.00 per month ($240.00 per year) for each child for general school expenses in the above calculations of reasonable monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given the parties’ financial circumstances, I was of the view that Hari Raya related expenses fell into the “good-to-have” category. There was no evidence before me to substantiate the quantum sought by the Mother. However, as the quantum and reasonableness of the expense itself was undisputed by the Father, I assessed $350.00 per annum to be a reasonable annual expense, to be jointly borne by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Youngest child’s medical expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     It was undisputed that the youngest child required medical treatment for her eczema condition. However, the treatment at the private clinic was an exceptional expense which ought to have been supported by evidence (<em>UEB</em> at [13]). Unfortunately, the evidence produced by the Mother to substantiate this expense was sorely lacking. Based on what I had before me, I concluded that the treatment at the private clinic was not a necessity, as the Mother had sought to argue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Though I accepted the Mother’s assertion that the youngest child benefitted from the wet wrap therapy at the private clinic, there was no objective medical evidence before me that the child required <em>that</em> specific treatment at <em>that</em> specific clinic, or that more cost-effective alternatives were unavailable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Mother argued that the Mother would not have found it necessary to seek further treatment in private clinics if the public hospital had solved the problem. I found this argument to be entirely unhelpful and circular in its reasoning and did not give it much weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother asserted that the Father had agreed to bear part of the expense. The Father denied this. I did not accept the Mother’s assertion. First, it was inconsistent with her earlier claimed that she had attempted to communicate with the Father about the expense, but that he had “<em>totally ignored</em>” her. Second, the purported agreement was part of discussions during a mediation session which were without prejudice, as the Father pointed out. Third, the text messages the Mother relied on as proof of the agreement clearly showed that the Father had disagreed with the expense, citing his financial ability. The Mother had nonetheless unilaterally decided to proceed with the expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given the foregoing, I found the total expense of $8,802.84 incurred by the Mother (as at 13 May 2025) for the child’s private clinic treatments to be excessive and did not think it reasonable for the Father to be obliged to pay 50% of this cost. The child’s treatments at the public hospital from 3 April 2024 to 7 August 2024, in comparison, only amounted to $596.99 in total.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Using the cost of these public hospital treatments as a benchmark, I estimated that $150.00 per month would have been reasonable expense for the child’s treatments. For the 8-month period from 31 August 2024 to 23 April 2025, this would have amounted to a total of $1,200.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Oldest child’s mobile phone expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This was not a reasonable expense and could have been avoided with closer supervision of the child. The bills submitted by the Mother showed that the transactions took place over an extended period, from 29 March 2024 to 7 May 2024. No explanation was given by either party as to why this was allowed to continue, especially given it was a repeat occurrence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I agreed with the Father’s position that the parent in whose care the oldest child was at the time the transactions took place should be responsible for this expense. Neither party submitted any evidence as to who cared for the child when the transactions were made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Given the Father generally had care of the children on Sundays, I found that the Father should only be responsible for the transactions incurred on Sunday, 5 May 2024 which amounted to $264.95. The Mother should bear the responsibility for the costs of the remaining transactions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasonable maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having assessed the children’s reasonable expenses, I turned to the question of what constituted reasonable maintenance in the present case.

medical and school expenses on an ad-hoc or annual basis. In this regard, I found that additional provisions ought to be made for such ad-hoc expenses and made orders accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Father had been paying a reasonable sum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It was undisputed that the Father had been paying the Mother monthly maintenance for the children. However, he had, by his own admission, gradually and unilaterally reduced the maintenance paid to the Mother since June 2024 to prioritize personal savings for himself.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He paid $1,500.00 in September 2024 and thereafter paid $1,000.00 per month since October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In addition, the Father also directly covered some of the children’s expenses when they were in his care. Though this fact was undisputed, the parties disagreed on the quantum. The Father suggested in his oral evidence that these direct payments amounted to $565.00 per month. There was no documentary evidence supporting this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I was unconvinced that the Father spent $565.00 per month on the children when they were in his care. I found this to be overstated, given the parties’ financial circumstances. Moreover, by the Father’s own admission, the children were only with him two to three days per month, during which time the children sometimes had meals prepared at home by their grandmother. Even if I accepted the Father’s assertions, his total contributions would still fall below what I had assessed to be reasonable maintenance, as set out in the tables above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I was therefore satisfied that there had been a neglect or refusal to pay reasonable maintenance on the Father’s part since 6 September 2024 (when the application was filed) and that a maintenance order should accordingly be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Appropriate quantum of maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I turn now to the question of the appropriate quantum of maintenance that should be ordered. This largely depended on the parties’ respective financial means and capabilities (<em>UHA</em> at [36]; <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [41]). In assessing the parties’ precise obligations, I considered the ratio of the parties’ income and the Father’s financial ability to pay the maintenance ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having reviewed the Father’s net monthly income and his own reasonable expenses, I found the Father to be financially capable of fully covering his proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses as set out above. Based on the estimates provided by the Father, his monthly expenses came up to about $3,046.67. However, this sum included a monthly allowance of $800.00 for his parents and $700.00 in monthly personal savings, both of which should not be prioritized over the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Having considered the Father’s evidence in totality, I assessed the Father’s own reasonable expenses to be approximately $1,190.67 per month. A breakdown of my assessment is set out at Annex 2. With the Father’s net monthly income of $5,109.56, the Father had more than enough to cover his proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses, as well as any additional expenses he may directly incur when the children are in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Backdating of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As I had found that the Father had neglected or refused to pay reasonable maintenance since 6 September 2024, I considered whether backdated maintenance should be ordered. The court has a wide power to backdate maintenance to a date which it considers fair (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0955.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 955</a> at [13]; <em>VOD v VOC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27188-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC(A) 6</a> at [141]-[145]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the monthly maintenance payments made by the Father to-date, I found it appropriate for the monthly sum of $2,085.00 to be backdated to 6 September 2024 i.e., when the present application was filed and the Father had reduced the monthly maintenance sum to $1,500.00 before subsequently reducing it further. After deducting the sums already paid by the Father, the total quantum of backdated maintenance amounted to $9,265.00 for a period of 9 months from 6 September 2024 to 3 June 2025. I found it reasonable for the Father to pay for this in instalments of $545.00 per month (17 instalments), which I assessed to be within his financial capability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable mode of provision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     When a maintenance order is made, the mode of provision of maintenance should be reasonable. In the present case, I found that fixed payments on a monthly and annual basis were reasonable, with any additional expenses to be covered on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I accepted the Mother’s submission that the provision of regular expenses on a reimbursement basis would be difficult, given the strained relationship between the parties. The parties appeared to disagree on even basic items such as purchasing shoes for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Moreover, as the care and control parent who was managing the children around 90% of the time, the Mother should be allowed to allocate the regular maintenance sums she receives for the children as she deems appropriate within a budget, without having to account to the Father for every single expense (<em>UEB</em> at [13]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father alleged in his closing submissions that the Mother was not transparent with her expenditure on the children or claims for maintenance. However, he did not provide any evidence of this. In any case, I found that any such transparency issue, even if made out, would be addressed by provisions for fixed payments towards the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Based on the figures and reasons given above, I ordered that the Father pay the Mother the following sums as maintenance for the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With effect from 4 June 2024, a monthly maintenance of $2,085.00 per month for the five children of the marriage, comprising:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $425.00 per month for each of the older three children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $380.00 per month for the fourth child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $430.00 per month for the youngest child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     69% of the costs (not covered by financial assistance) related to year-end school expenses (i.e., schoolbooks, uniform, shoes, bags, water bottles, stationery) for any/all of the five children on a reimbursement basis;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     69% of the costs related to expenses for specialist medical consultations, treatments, and/or hospitalization at government-subsidized hospitals (including any related outpatient medical expenses) for any/all of the five children on a reimbursement basis;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     An annual sum of $240.00 for the five children ($48.00 per child) for Hari Raya related expenses;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Backdated maintenance as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $9,265.00 as lump sum maintenance for the children for the period of 6 September 2024 to 3 June 2025, to be paid in equal instalments of $545.00 per month with effect from 4 June 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $830.00 as a partial reimbursement of the costs related to the youngest child’s medical expenses; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $264.95 as a partial reimbursement of the costs related to the oldest child’s mobile phone expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Counsel for the Mother sought costs of $500.00 to $750.00, on the basis that the Mother had largely won the proceedings. The Father disagreed, stating that he was unable to afford this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I made no orders as to costs. I did not agree with counsel’s position that the Mother had largely won the proceedings. Moreover, the proceedings were unnecessarily lengthened by delays on the Mother’s part, including the submission of new evidence during the trial when such evidence could have and should have been

But that is not the language of family law. An insistence on asserting one’s hard-nosed legal rights may, invariably, result in acrimonious and intractable disputes. This case, as will soon be apparent, is a salutary reminder of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This was a dispute between ex-spouses. Their divorce had been finalised when an order of court disposing of the ancillary matters was made on 31 March 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Parties, however, marked their return to court with the following cross-applications for personal protection orders (“PPO”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SSP 467 of 2025 (“SSP 467”) was the Mother’s application against the Father. She sought a PPO for herself and the two daughters (“C” and “D”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SSP 503 of 2025 (“SSP 503”) was Father’s application against the Mother. He sought a PPO for himself as well as C and D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of both matters. The Wife was represented by Ms Tan Siew Kim and Ms Rupawalla (“Ms Tan”). The Husband represented himself. Judgment was reserved. I had directed that parties file written submissions. They did so. Judgment was delivered on 16 August 2025. I dismissed both applications. These are my reasons for doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There are three main issues to be decided in these two applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Mother should be granted a PPO against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Father should be granted a PPO against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the two children, C<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and D, should be granted a PPO against both their parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Before turning to deal with these issues, I sketch out, in broad strokes, the applicable legal principles to such applications for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In his written submissions, the Father makes reference to the provisions of the Women’s Charter that were in force prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       That cannot be right. Because both SSP 467 and 503 were taken out after the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025, it is clear that the new legislative provisions relating to family violence apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Apart from referring me to provisions of the Women’s Charter that were inapplicable to the present applications, the Father had also cited a number of cases which he said stood for various propositions of law. The Father also submitted that some of these cases were analogous to the facts of the present case before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       While some of them, at first blush, are quite obviously fictitious cases given that the case names of Family Court are redacted, others appear, at first blush, to be legitimate cases.

That is because the neutral citations in question actually belonged to other cases, as I have set out in the list above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There were two possible explanations as to how these 14 cases, none of which appear to be legitimate cases, could have wormed their way into the Father’s written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The first, and what I considered to be the likelier possibility, was that the Father had used generative artificial intelligence tools (“generative AI tools”) to assist him in preparing his written submissions. The use of such tools in proceedings before the Family Court is regulated by the guidelines set out in the Registrar’s Circular No. 1 of 2024 titled: “Guide on the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools by Court Users” (the “Guide”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The Guide sets out principles relating to the use of generative AI tools in court proceedings, as well as a brief explanation of how such AI works.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In particular, the Guide emphasises that court users will remain responsible for all the content in their court documents and that they must ensure, amongst other things, that any AI generated output in their court documents is accurate and relevant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Guide also makes it clear that there will be consequences for non-compliance – this includes adverse costs orders being made, or that the material which had been submitted to court may be disregarded.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The second explanation was that the Father had deliberately cited these cases in an attempt to mislead the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given this, I saw fit to afford the Father the opportunity to explain himself. My judgment in respect of both matters was supposed to be delivered on 29 July 2025. I vacated that hearing and saw parties in chambers. I provided them a list of the 14 cases, and explained to them that it appeared to me that none of these cases existed. I drew parties’ attention to the Guide and directed the Father to file an affidavit explaining the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     How his written submissions had been prepared, and specifically, whether he had used generative AI tools in preparing those submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If he had used generative AI tools, he was to state how those tools were used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To explain how he had obtained every single case cited in his written submissions, and to explain whether those cases existed (if at all).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father complied with my directions and filed his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He stated that he had used ChatGPT to assist him in “identifying relevant local legal precedents”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He had done so by providing ChatGPT with a “detailed account” of the incidents in dispute.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> ChatGPT had provided an output, and he then proceeded to include all 14 proposed case citations in his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father confirmed that none of the cases he had cited exist.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He also stated that he had failed to verify these cases before including them in his submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Finally, the Father stated that while he was not aware of the Guide when he drafted his written submissions, he had since taken steps to familiarise himself with the Guide, and that he would undertake to confirm the accuracy and authenticity of all documents submitted to court in the future.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Apart from the Husband’s affidavit, Ms Rupawalla had also confirmed that none of these 14 cases that the Father had cited were genuine cases.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given what the Father had stated in his affidavit, it was quite clear that I do not need to consider those cases cited in his submissions. In any event, the applicable legal principles are to be found in family violence provisions as set out in the Women’s Charter 1961. A plain reading of those provisions make it clear that in order to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish the following two broad requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     First, it must be shown that the respondent had committed, or was likely to commit family violence against the person sought to be protected: s 60A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Second, it must be shown that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected: s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition to this, and notwithstanding the legislative amendments to the provisions of the Women’s Charter that deal with family violence, it goes without saying that the purpose of a PPO is not to punish acts of family violence, but rather, to protect victims of family violence (see <em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]). These orders are prospective. They are made with a view to breaking the cycle of domestic abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The main incidents in both these applications took place on the 1st and 5th of March 2025. These incidents arose out of the access arrangements for the two children. The Father was evidently frustrated by what he perceived to be the Mother’s attempt to deny him access to the children in spite of the court order that was made. The Mother evidently felt justified in acting the way she did on the basis that she, as well as the children, felt threatened by how the Father had behaved during his period of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Video recordings of both incidents on the 1st and 5th of March were adduced as evidence by the Mother. They provide a view as to what had happened on that day and how parties had acted towards each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Insofar as the incident on the 1st of March is concerned, I did not find that either the Father or the Mother had committed family violence on each other. The footage, which was taken from a CCTV, shows that both the Father and the Mother were engaged in a tug of war over their eldest child who was, unfortunately, caught up in the center of their dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As far as I could tell from the CCTV footage, neither the Father nor the Mother had acted aggressively towards the other, though the Father did seem visibly more frustrated than the Mother. One might quite justifiably conclude that the actions of both the Father and the Mother were less than ideal given that their eldest child (“C”) was caught in the crossfire. Their actions, however, did not, in my judgment, cross the line and stray into the realm of either physical abuse, or emotional and/or psychological abuse. For one, although both the Mother and Father were engaged in a tug of war, their actions quite clearly showed that neither of them were at risk of suffering physical pain or personal injury despite the fact that they were engaged in a physical struggle over the child. I would also add that insofar as the Father claimed that the Mother had scratched him during the tussle over their eldest child, he had not put anything before me to prove the severity of these scratches. In short, the Father had not proved that the Mother had, by scratching him in the tussle, caused him physical pain such that her actions could conceivably fall within the definition of physical abuse as is set out in s 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Insofar as the Father and the Mother both point the finger at each other and allege that they had suffered emotional and/or psychological abuse in both incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025, I also do not find that to be the case. Parties were clearly upset, frustrated, and unhappy with each other. That is, however, an entirely reasonable and natural reaction to have when one finds themselves embroiled in a dispute, especially over matters that are close to one’s heart. But that cannot, and in my judgment – does not, fall within the definition of emotional and/or psychological abuse as is set out in s 58B(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I do not find that either the Father, or the Mother, were likely to commit family violence on each other. The evidence shows that the both of them are clearly unhappy with each other. But that alone does not necessarily point to the likelihood of them committing family violence on each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The both of them had also dredged up incidents from the time when they were still married. Even if I accepted that their respective accounts were true, I did not find that these incidents established a present pattern of conduct, on either the part of the Father, or the Mother, that pointed to the likelihood of them committing family violence on each other. That is because these incidents occurred whilst parties were still married. The situation now is rather different given that parties have gone their separate ways and that some time has passed since their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I also find that neither the Mother, nor the Father, had committed family violence on the two children. Both the Mother and the Father sought to highlight, and emphasise, the alleged trauma both children had experienced as a result of being caught up in the incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There can be little doubt that both the children were, in all likelihood, distressed from being embroiled in their parents’ dispute. However, I did not think it was open to either the Mother, or the Father, to rely on this to accuse each other of having committed emotional and/or psychological abuse on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For one, it was clear to me that the both of them felt justified in acting in the way they did in both incidents. The Mother justified her actions on the need to protect herself and the children from the Father. The Father, on the other hand, insisted on exercising his access rights pursuant to the court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As a result, neither the Mother, nor the Father, could find common ground to resolve their differences in a manner that would not adversely impact the children. That was what the both of them could have, and should have, done, or at the very least – attempted to do. In my judgment, the both of them must take some personal responsibility for how the incidents on 1st and 5th of March had escalated and adversely impacted both their children. It therefore does not lie in their mouth to now claim that the way the other party had behaved in those two incidents had amounted to emotional and/or psychological abuse on both the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As a final point, I do not find that either the Father, or the Mother, were likely to commit family violence on the two children. I found that the both of them do, in their own way, care for their children – that much was evident from the Mother’s testimony as well as the videos which the Father had submitted to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Having concluded that neither the Father or the Mother had committed, or were likely to commit family violence on each other or the children, the result is that their respective applications for a PPO must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In any event, I did not find it necessary to order a PPO for either the Father or the Mother’s own protection. In assessing the necessity of a PPO, the court considers the risk of family violence being committed in the future. This is in line with the whole point of a PPO which is, as I have pointed out, a forward-looking order that is meant to shield parties from future abuse and not meant to punish past acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It was clear to me in the present case that the recent incidents between the Father and the Mother had arisen because of problems relating to the Father’s access to the two children. As I had mentioned, both the Father and the Mother clearly felt that their actions were justified. This led to the both of them clashing over the access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Notwithstanding the incidents that had taken place, the reality of the situation is that there was a clear degree of separation between both the Father and the Mother. It was evident to me that the both of them would only come into contact with each other when the children are involved. It was also evident to me, from the incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025, that other parties, namely their own parents, would be present when they both come into contact with each other, and would step in to attempt to break up any argument between the two of them. Given these facts, there is, in my judgment, a low risk of the Father and the Mother committing family violence on each other. I therefore found that it was not necessary to order a PPO for their own protection or personal safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I also found that it was not necessary to order a PPO in favour of the children to protect them from the Father and the Mother. For one, as I have mentioned earlier, I did find that the Mother and the Father do care for both children in their own way. The reality of the situation, as I have found, was that any adverse impact on the children arose precisely because both parents insisted on having things done in their own uncompromising way. Although there may continue to be problems arising from access arrangements going forwards, that is an issue for both the Father and the Mother to work through on their own in a sensible and mature way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given what I had set out above, I dismissed both applications in SSP 467 and 503 of 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On the issue of costs, Ms Rupawalla submitted that while it was appropriate to make no order as to costs given that neither party had succeeded in their respective applications, I should order the Father to pay costs fixed at $5000 (all-in) to account for the work that had to be done in respect of the fake cases that the Father had submitted to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father, on the other hand, sought costs of $2000 to account for the costs he had incurred when he sought legal advice in preparing for both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Given that neither party had succeeded in their respective applications, the starting point should be that there be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I saw fit to depart from that starting point, taking into account the fake cases that the Father had cited. While I accepted that he had taken ownership of what he has done, the reality was that his actions required efforts to be undertaken, by Ms Rupawalla, to double check that none of the cases cited are legitimate cases. A hearing date also had to be vacated as a result. This must all be reflected by way of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I therefore ordered the Father to pay costs, which I fixed at $1000 (all in) to the Mother by the 22nd of August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In addition to this order of costs, I was also minded to make further orders to guard against the citation of AI hallucinated material to the court. Specifically, I was minded to order that the Father, if he so chooses to represent himself in any future matter before the Family Courts, and should he use generative AI in preparing any document that is submitted to the courts for the purposes of proceedings, he must, accordingly, declare this in writing to the court and state that he has complied with the Guide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I indicated this to both the Father, as well as Ms Rupawalla, and invited arguments from the both of them on this point, and whether any orders along the lines I had sketched out above (at [46]) should be made. Ms Rupawalla indicated that she did not have anything to add. The Father on the other hand, indicated that he was agreeable to such orders being made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I deemed it necessary to make such orders (at [46]) given what has transpired here in the present case. In a common law system such as ours, the citation of cases to the court plays an important role – especially considering the principles of <em>stare decisis</em> and <em>ratio decidendi</em> (see <em>eg</em>: Julius Stone, “The Ratio of the Ratio Decidendi” (1959) 22(6) Modern Law Review 597; A.L. Goodhart, “The Ratio Decidendi of a Case” (1959) 22(2) Modern Law Review 117; J.L. Montrose, “Ratio Decidendi and the House of Lords” (1957) 20(2) Modern Law Review 124; A.L. Goodhart, “Determining the Ratio Decidendi of a Case” (1930) 40(2) Yale Law Journal 161 for a discussion on determining the <em>ratio</em> of a case). In fact, that was <b><em>precisely</em></b> the reason why the Father had cited me those cases in his submissions – he sought to persuade me that the present case was materially similar to the facts of those cases, and so the outcome too, should be the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The corollary of this is that if common law is to continue operating in the modern age alongside technology such as generative AI, the courts must be able to take, at face value, the cases which parties have cited either in their written submissions or their bundle of authorities. The citation of fake or AI hallucinated cases to the courts thus has a deeply corrosive effect on the legal system. If there is a suspicion that the cases, or paragraphs from cases cited are not genuine, then time and effort will have to be spent checking the provenance and authenticity of the material which had been cited (see <em>May v Costaras</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2025/178.html')\">[2025] NSWCA 178</a> at [12] citing <em>Ayinde v The London Borough of Haringey</em> [2025] EWHC 1383 (Admin) at [9]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I thus saw fit to order that the Father make the respective declarations to the Family Court in any future matter – this is especially since the Mother will, in all likelihood, be the respondent in any future application brought by the Father in the Family Courts, and so will be affected should the Father once again rely on the product of AI hallucinations. In that vein, it is, after all, well established that the court does have the inherent power to prevent an abuse of its own processes (see: <em>Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18407-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 373</a> at [188]; <em>Cheong Wei Chang v Lee Hsien Loong and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22781-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 326</a> at [65] <em>citing Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0117.xml')\">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 117</a> at [81]; <em>FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd v Authentic Builder Pte Ltd and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21648-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCR 3</a> at [22] – [23]), and this extends to guarding against the citation of fake cases: <em>Bandla v Solicitors Regulation Authority</em> [2025] EWHC 1167 (Admin) at [53].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     To be clear, my order does not prohibit the Father from using generative AI – indeed, as the Guide states, the use of generative AI is not prohibited. Rather, the Father had to make the necessary declarations should he use generative AI to assist him in preparing his court documents. I considered this approach to be one that struck a fair balance between allowing the use of generative AI and ensuring that the court is not taken by surprise by the product of AI hallucinations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As a final point, I must emphasise that the fact that the Father is self-represented in these proceedings does not absolve him of responsibility of ensuring that the information he had submitted to court is accurate. That much is also made clear by the Guide. In this connection, to the Father’s credit, he did fully accept responsibility for his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I concluded my judgment with a few words to both the Father and the Mother. The poet Kahil Gibran, in his poem “On Children”, wrote:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Your children are not your children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">They come through you but not from you,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For they have their own thoughts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is clear to me that although your divorce has concluded, the both of you still bear many grievances towards each other. That is understandable. But you must think of the two children you have brought into this world. Being little, they will need the guidance and the wisdom of both their parents to show them the ways of the world. Work together to give them that. Do not let your emotions or preconceived notions or personal animosity with each other stand in the way of their developmental needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     By way of a brief postscript, after I had delivered my judgment, both the Father and Mother indicated that they would like to resume counselling in an attempt to improve the situation relating to the access arrangements, and actively took steps to do so. I was heartened by their efforts, and what appeared to be a genuine attempt by them to leave behind their unhappy past. I would strongly encourage them to stay the course.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s Written

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This case involves allegations of family violence committed against a young child who shows some signs of light autism. It raises several important issues which lie at the intersection of evidential principles and child protection. For instance, in what circumstances should a child witness be called to testify? How do differences in communication style and behaviour of the child witness in this case affect the assessment and weight of his testimony?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The applicant (“<b>Mother</b>”) and the respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) have two sons. The children were born in August 2014 (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> Son</b>”) and October 2016 (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Son</b>”). The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son shows some signs of light autism.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 7 July 2024, the Mother left the matrimonial home with the 1<sup>st</sup> Son after a domestic incident with the Father. She later found a shelter which took them in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime after the Mother and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son had left the matrimonial home, the Father brought the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to stay with his mother (“<b>paternal grandmother</b>”) at her flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 17 September 2024, after his tuition class had ended at around 6.00 pm,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not proceed to his paternal grandmother’s flat. Instead, he returned to his matrimonial home by himself and approached a neighbour (“<b>Neighbour</b>”) for help. The Neighbour called the Mother, who promptly contacted the Police. When she arrived at the Neighbour’s unit, the Mother saw the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son with the Police. At or around 8.00 pm, the child was conveyed by ambulance to the hospital.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Child Protective Services were activated, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son remained in the hospital for about one month (until 15 October 2024). After his discharge, the child was placed in the Mother’s care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 5 November 2024, the Father applied for sole custody, care and control of the children: OSG xxx/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 19 November 2024, the Mother applied for a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) to protect the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son from the Father: SS 2189/2024. This application is based on incidents that had allegedly occurred from around September 2024 to December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       After considering the evidence and submissions, I granted the PPO application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on or before 17 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I shall begin with the first incident which had occurred on or before 17 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her PPO application, the Mother stated that this incident involved “physical punishment and psychological abuse” against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In her affidavit, the Mother elaborated that at about 5.49 pm on 17 September 2024, she had received a message from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s tuition teacher that the child wanted to speak to her. When she contacted the child, he was crying. Shortly thereafter, she received a call from the Neighbour who informed her that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had gone to her unit to seek help: see [5] above. When the Mother arrived at the Neighbour’s unit, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son told the Police, “I want to go with Mommy” and “Dad and Grandma bully me”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the trial, the Mother added that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had also told the Police that the Father and paternal grandmother were very violent towards him and he could not stay with them anymore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Calling the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son as a witness</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s testimony is clearly important in determining whether the Father had committed family violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother did not have any personal knowledge of such violence. Her evidence about the violence is based on what the child had told her. Her evidence about the violence is clearly hearsay and is thus of limited value on its own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there was no objective evidence (e.g. recordings) that could independently prove that the Father had committed family violence against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Despite the importance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence, the Mother (who was self-represented at the material time) did not think of calling him to testify at the PPO trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Given (1) the centrality of the child’s testimony to the allegations of family violence and (2) his young age (he was about nine years old at the time of trial), I sought the parties’ views as to whether he should testify.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     After I had explained to the Mother the importance of direct evidence regarding the alleged family violence, she informed me readily that she would like the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to give evidence. She requested that he be allowed to do so in writing – as he had been showing some signs of light autism and sometimes struggled with oral communication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Counsel for the Father, Mr Clarence Lun, raised three concerns: (i) that the child’s evidence might delay the trial; (ii) that he might be unable to give clear evidence given his condition; and (iii) that his testimony might be coached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering the matter, I decided to allow the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to testify.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, an allegation of family violence against a child is a serious matter and must be investigated properly. If the allegation is borne out, then a PPO ought to be issued to protect the child. Conversely, if there is no evidence of family violence, then the respondent ought to be vindicated. This is especially so where there are pending custody or other proceedings relating to the child – as the allegation of family violence can have a material bearing on such proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is vital that a person sought to be protected by a PPO be given the opportunity to be heard. If a child can testify, then he/she should have a voice in the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the law does not treat a child’s evidence as being inherently unreliable. The key question is not a witness’s age – but the child’s ability to understand questions and to provide intelligible answers. This principle applies equally where the child shows some signs of light autism. Whether such a witness can give credible and reliable evidence is a matter that can be assessed when he/she testifies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I informed the parties that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would be allowed to testify via Zoom from a separate room with a vulnerable witness support volunteer. The child would also be permitted to write out his answers, if he preferred.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Additionally, I directed the Mother not to discuss with the child about his evidence in court. This would not only preserve the integrity of his evidence – but also avoid adding undue stress to him. She confirmed that she understood my directions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The matter was then adjourned for the relevant arrangements to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On the day the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son was to give evidence, I proposed to the parties that (a) I sit in the same room as him, and (b) his evidence be transmitted live to the parties who remained in the courtroom. This would enable me to directly observe the child at all material times. The parties agreed to this arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     When the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son testified, I observed him to be alert – but reserved and non-verbal. He understood the questions posed to him, and answered them through gestures as well as by writing short but clear sentences in a notebook. For instance, he wrote that his favourite subject was Mathematics.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The child did not answer some questions. In my view, this was due to his discomfort with the matters asked, and not because he did not understand them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     During the examination-in-chief, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son wrote down the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “Beat” – when asked whether the Father had done anything to him while they were staying with the paternal grandmother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “Very bad” – when asked what he thought of the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “He beat” – when asked why the Father was bad.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In cross-examination, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Shook his head when asked whether he had missed the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Wrote “Yes” (and circled the word several times) when asked whether he was happy with the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Additionally, when asked which school level he was in when the beating took place, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son held up two fingers (indicating Primary Two).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As he was in Primary Three in 2025,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> this meant that the beating incident would have occurred in 2024. This coincides with the events on 17 September 2024: see [5] and [10(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     After the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had completed his testimony, the Father gave evidence. He denied having beaten the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence disclosed the commission of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence – if true – clearly establishes that the Father had beaten him, and that this had occurred in 2024 while they were staying at the paternal grandmother’s flat: see [18] to [20] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Lack of particulars regarding the family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The child’s evidence however lacked particulars as to the number, date(s), and manner of the beating(s). Does this mean that the Mother had failed to discharge her burden of proof?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, the answer is no. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the burden on the Mother is to prove on a <em>balance of probabilities</em> that “family violence [had] been committed or is likely to be committed” against the child: see s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). In other words, the Mother is required to simply show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence – that the Father had beaten him – is more likely to be true when compared to the latter’s denial of the beating(s).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the absence of details of the family violence <em>per se</em> does not negate the credibility and reliability of the child’s evidence – especially if, for instance, it is (i) clear in substance, (ii) supported by contemporaneous evidence, and (iii) corroborated by trauma symptoms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, and in any event, it is clear from s 65(1) that there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence has in fact been committed before a PPO can be granted. It is sufficient for the applicant to show – on a balance of probabilities – that such violence “<em>is likely to be committed</em> against a family member”: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, a PPO is pre-emptive in nature – it seeks to <em>protect</em> an applicant from family violence <em>in the future</em>. In this sense, a PPO trial is different from a prosecution where a parent is tried for having committed an offence against his/her child, e.g., under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. As a prosecution seeks to <em>punish past acts</em> of violence, details regarding the violence must be proved <em>beyond reasonable doubt</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To sum-up, there is no need to prove the number, date(s), and manner of the past beating(s) by the Father to secure a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I should add that the absence of particulars regarding the number, date(s), and manner of the beating(s) in the present case does not prejudice the Father. This is because his defence is one of denial – he did not beat the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s attempt to discredit the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Mr Lun submitted that I should not give any weight to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence. He contended that the child had given an “inherently contradictory” answer (“don’t know”) to his question as to whether the Father had ever taken him out to play.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Mr Lun went on to submit that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">21    As a whole, [the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s] <em>emotional withdrawal, difficulty articulating freely, reluctance in communication, and simplistic negative characterizations</em> of his father might suggest undue psychological pressure or an implicit understanding of expected responses from his mother. The <em>lack of spontaneous elaboration and [the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s] repetitive responses</em> strengthen the suggestion that these emotional reactions could have been prompted or reinforced by [the Mother’s] influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Testimonial evidence by witnesses with autism</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I am unable to agree with Mr Lun’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is settled law that when assessing testimonial evidence, courts give due regard to the <em>subjective characteristics</em> of the witnesses concerned. For instance, in the case of child witnesses, courts no longer assess their evidence from the perspective of rigid stereotypes – e.g., by deeming them to be less reliable and credible witnesses. Neither do courts measure their evidence through the lens of how adults would react when placed in their positions. Instead, courts assess a child’s mental development and ability to communicate on an individual basis: <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> at [97]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23089-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 749</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son is a nine-year-old child with some signs of light autism. There is extensive literature regarding the behaviour of persons with autism, including as witnesses in trials. Some insights from the literature include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Persons with autism may have difficulties with verbal communication. For instance, in –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Forming complex sentences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Understanding information what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Understanding non-literal or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., where a word has multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Paying attention to oral communications when placed in a highly stressful situation. (Testifying in court can be such a situation.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Persons with autism may communicate differently. For instance, some may find it difficult to maintain eye contact. Some may also speak with an emotional tone that does not match their speech’s content (e.g., speaking neutrally about distressing events).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Persons with autism may be less able to recall details of personal experiences and contextual details (e.g., when and where did an incident occur).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Persons with autism may also report facts literally – and thus be less likely to embellish or interpret events through subjective lenses. These features can reduce the risk of exaggeration or interpretive “filling in” that is sometimes observed in neurotypical witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Trauma may cause some children with autism to exhibit behaviour such as self-injury, aggression, and emotional shutdowns – or cause such behaviour to worsen if they already exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>See e.g., the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (5<sup>th</sup> edition, American Psychiatric Association); Lucy A.

The features of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence (see [27] above in italics) are in fact <em>consistent</em> with how some persons with autism may be expected to behave: see the insights in [30] above. In the circumstances, it is wrong to conclude that the child’s evidence is neither credible nor reliable merely because he had given evidence in way that differs from neurotypical individuals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence is credible and reliable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Giving due regard to the subjective characteristics of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son, I find that his evidence that the Father had beaten him is more likely than not to be true. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>First</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not waver or show any uncertainty when he gave evidence of the beating(s) and that this was his reason for disliking the Father: see [18] and [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Second</em>, having paid close attention to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son when he testified, I found no evidence of coaching. The child stated simply (but factually) that he was beaten by the Father without any embellishment. Further, he testified that he “did not know” how he had come to leave his paternal grandmother’s flat to stay with the Mother in September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> He had also refused to elaborate on how he had been beaten by the Father. All these suggest that the child was not providing rehearsed detail to falsely implicate the Father. Mr Lun, who had the opportunity to test the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence, did not establish either coaching or fabrication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35      <em>Third</em>, the unusual and spontaneous circumstances in which the beating(s) came to light are also significant. The violence was revealed after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son turned up at the Neighbour’s unit unexpectedly to seek help. Moments before this, the child had also sought his tuition teacher’s assistance to contact the Mother. He cried on seeing the Mother. All these add to the credibility of the child’s evidence that he had been beaten by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence about the beating(s) is supported by the trauma signs that he had exhibited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It was not disputed that after the intervention of the authorities on 17 September 2024, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had to be hospitalised for about one month: see [5] and [6] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     After his discharge from hospital, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not want to meet the Father when the latter visited the school. According to the child, this was because he felt scared and angry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Additionally, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would suddenly scream and cry in the middle of the night. When questioned by the Mother about these incidents, the child replied that he had scary dreams, mostly involving the Father chasing him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Concerned by these nightmares and screaming episodes, the Mother brought the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to a polyclinic – which then referred him to the Institute of Mental Health (“<b>IMH</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> When the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”) of IMH asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son about the nightmares, he drew an angry face of the Father and paternal grandmother. Disturbingly, he had also written “Papa die, grandmother die” when asked for his three wishes. Based on CGC’s clinical impression, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son was suffering from an “Emotional Disturbance of Childhood”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> (To be clear, I did not give any weight to CGC’s opinion that the Father had committed family violence and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would benefit from a PPO. Clearly, these are determinations to be made by a court after assessing all the evidence.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_e\"></a>(e)     At the time of the trial, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son remained deeply affected by what the Father had done to him. When asked to describe the beating(s), the child refused to elaborate – and instead chose to stand against a wall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     To sum-up – the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence (that he had been beaten) is so drastically different from that of the Father. There is no issue of the child having made a mistake. It is ultimately a question of which of the two mutually exclusive evidence is to be believed. Based on the factors in [33] to [36] above, I am satisfied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had told the truth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The other incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I shall now turn to the other incidents relied by the Mother for her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is the Mother’s case that after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s discharge from hospital, the Father had visited the child’s student care centre and school on the following occasions and created a scene.

Her evidence regarding these incidents would have been based on hearsay accounts given by those who were present at the material times – i.e., the staff from the school and student care centre, as well as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Mother did not call the relevant staff to testify during the trial. This meant that there is no admissible evidence to contradict the Father’s claims that (1) he did not behave aggressively during the relevant visits, (2) he was not at the student care centre on 28 October 2024, (3) he did not speak to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son on 27 November 2024, and (4) his communications with the child on the other occasions were uneventful: see [41].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Neither did the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son provide any evidence to confirm the details in [39]. Although he did disclose in court that he had repeatedly refused to meet the Father out of fear or anger, it is unclear whether this was due to the latter’s conduct during these visits – or the prior beating(s).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, I agree with Mr Lun that even if the hearsay evidence in [39] were to be given full weight, they would still fail to prove that “family violence” had been committed. For instance, they do not show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed, or attempted to place, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son in fear of hurt. Neither do they show that the Father had continually harassed the child with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause anguish to him. I accept Mr Lun’s submission that the harassment (if any) was to the staff of the student care centre / school – not the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     To sum-up, I find that the Father had beaten the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son sometime on or before 17 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, a PPO is necessary to remind the Father that he must not commit any further family violence against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son. Such a reminder is particularly important in the present case as the child shows some signs of light autism. Research shows that children with autism often experience distressing events with heightened intensity due to sensory and emotional sensitivities. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s nightmares, emotional withdrawal, and disturbing expressions are consistent with him having been deeply traumatised by the beating(s). The child ought to be protected from further family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     For the above reasons, I allowed the Mother’s PPO application – to take effect from 2 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I wish to state that in March 2025, I had also granted a PPO against the Father to protect the Mother and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son: see SS 1299/2024 (“<b>SS 1299</b>”) and <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I stress that in deciding to grant a PPO for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son, I was not affected by the decision in SS 1299. That decision has no bearing on the present case. The two matters involve different protected persons, different facts, and distinct evidential assessment.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Father’s Affidavit dated 12.02.25 at [25].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Father’s Affidavit dated 12.02.25 at [26].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Father’s Affidavit dated 12.02.25 at [26], [30] and [31]; Respondent’s Written Closing Submissions dated 25.07.25 at [14].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See the application (C1) at page 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 03.04.25 at page 8 (line 5) to page 13 (line 27), page 36 (line 4 to line 13).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 03.04.25 at page 12 (line 13 to line 21).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 03.04.25 at page 13 (line 12 to line 27).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 11 (line 4 to line 10).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 23 (line 1 to line 4).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 26 (line 8 to line 14).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 26 (line 11 to line 14).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 30 (line 19 to line 21).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 31 (line 2 to line 6).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 33 (line 3 to line 14).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 03.04.25 at page 10 (line 1 to line 13).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Respondent’s Written Closing Submissions dated 25.07.25 at [20].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Respondent’s Written Closing Submissions dated 25.07.25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Article accessible at www.sciencedirect.com</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Article accessible at www.nature.com/scientificreport</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Article accessible at www.journals.sagepub.com</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Article accessible at www.sciencedirect.com</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 07.05.25 at page 11 (line 22) to page 12 (line 14).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>Mother’s Affidavit dated 27.12.25 at [28].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Mother’s Affidavit dated 27.12.25 at page 17.

In October 2024, the Applicant applied for a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) against the Respondent. She relied on six incidents to support her application. These involved the Respondent (a) allegedly creating a scene at her business premises, (b) sending disparaging emails and messages about her to third parties, and (c) posting adverse comments and one-star reviews about her businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed, the Applicant must establish on a balance of probabilities two matters: <em>first</em>, that the Respondent had committed or is likely to commit “family violence” within the meaning of s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). <em>Second</em>, that a PPO is necessary for her protection. The central questions in this case are thus (a) whether the Respondent’s conduct as described in [1] above amounts to family violence, and (b) whether the risk of recurrence justifies the making of a protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After considering the evidence and submissions, I granted the PPO application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 12 May 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The first incident occurred on 12 May 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That day, the Respondent had allegedly sent the Applicant messages (a) requiring her to remove her name as a co-owner of their matrimonial flat, (b) threatening to tarnish her business and personal reputation, and (c) using expletives and insulting language about her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Respondent denied having sent the messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The contents of the messages allegedly sent on 12 May 2023 are of critical importance in establishing whether the Respondent had committed family violence against the Applicant. Given this, she ought to have produced these messages in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Applicant had failed to do so. No explanation was provided to account for this failure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the circumstances, I find that the Applicant had failed to prove that the Respondent had committed family violence against her on 13 May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 3 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I now turn to the next incident. It is not disputed that (a) on 3 July 2024, the Respondent had visited the Applicant’s hair salon at Geylang (“<b>Geylang Salon</b>”) to look for her, and (b) the latter was not at the salon at the material time. The dispute regarding this incident centred on whether the Respondent had committed certain acts alleged against him during the visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to “N” (the Applicant’s employee who was present during the visit), the Respondent had approached her and asked in a loud and threatening voice for the Applicant. When she replied that the Applicant was not at the salon, he started to swear and shout that the Applicant had been cheating people. Additionally, he stopped people from entering the premises – telling them that the Applicant had owed him a lot of money, cheated a lot of people, and slept with customers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> “N” reported the incident to the Applicant, who lodged a police report the next day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Respondent denied the allegations. He called “P” to support his case that his visit to the salon was uneventful. According to “P”, the Respondent left immediately upon being informed that the Applicant was not there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Applicant’s case regarding the 3 July incident rested solely on “N”’s evidence. I find that “N”’s evidence is more likely than not to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is inconceivable that “N” would – <em>on her own initiative</em> – fabricate false evidence against the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is also not plausible that the Applicant had instigated “N” to give false evidence for the purpose of supporting her PPO application. Based on “N”’s account, the Applicant had lodged a contemporaneous police report on 4 July 2024 (i.e., about three months before the application).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given that this report was made well before the application was filed – it is highly unlikely that the report was part of the Applicant’s elaborate plan to fix-up the Respondent. This is especially so when the Applicant did not mention either the 3 July incident or the police report in her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Respondent’s own evidence shows that he had a motive to confront the Applicant on 3 July 2024 – she had refused to return him $20,000 about two weeks earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> “N”’s evidence that he had accused the Applicant of cheating him is thus consistent with his contemporaneous financial dispute the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Fourth</em>, “N”’s evidence – that the Respondent had maligned the Applicant’s character at the salon – is also corroborated by his messages to the Applicant’s business partner “W” sent just five days later (on 8 July 2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In those messages, he had<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Described the Applicant as a “FAKE VIRGIN”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Accused her of having committed adultery, cheated his money, and refused to pay her creditors,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Stated his intention to warned others about the Applicant,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Admitted that he had gone to her salon to ask for money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The close temporal proximity between the 3 July incident and the Respondent’s 8 July email strengthens the credibility of “N”’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Fifth</em>, “N”’s description of the Respondent as being aggressive during the 3 July incident is consistent with how he had conducted himself during the trial. At times, he was unnecessarily difficult and combative when he cross-examined the Applicant’s witnesses and engaged with her counsel (Mr Raymund). For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He had refused to answer a valid answer concerning the truthfulness of his claim that the Applicant was promiscuous.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When it was suggested to him that he had made a threat to the Applicant in his email dated 12 July 2024 (see [16] below), the Respondent retorted <em>“... when I say, “I wish to kill you”, does that mean I will kill you?”</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <em>Finally</em>, I decline to give weight to “P”’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There is serious doubt as to how she had prepared her affidavit (exhibit R12). According to her, she prepared the affidavit in the Vietnamese language and then had it translated into English. This is contradicted by the Respondent, who testified that <em>he</em> had prepared the affidavit in <em>English</em>, and then had it translated into the Vietnamese language for “P”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Based on the Respondent’s evidence in (i) above, it appears that the contents of “P”’s affidavit were not based on her own independent recollection of the events. Indeed, “P” testified that she had obtained the relevant information from the Respondent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “P” had a salary dispute with the Applicant. Although this dispute was eventually settled, the payments were still outstanding at the time of the trial. This unresolved dispute with the Applicant potentially undermined “P”’s neutrality.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Finally, based on “P”’s evidence, the 3 July incident would have been an uneventful one for her. After all, the Respondent did not create a scene and had left immediately upon being informed that the Applicant was not at the salon. In the circumstances, there was no reason for “P” to pay attention to the Respondent at the salon or to recall what he had said and done at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the reasons in [12] above, I accept “N”’s evidence. Based on this evidence, the Respondent’s conduct on 3 July 2024 – creating a scene, driving away customers, and making disparaging allegations against the Applicant – amounts to family violence. He must have known that such conduct – which appears to be intended to pressure the Applicant into paying him $20,000 – was likely to cause her fear and anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 12 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I now come to the next incident. This concerns an email that the Respondent had sent to his case officer at a Family Services Centre (“<b>FSC</b>”) on 12 July 2024 (“<b>Email</b>”). The email (which was copied to the Applicant) alleged that the Applicant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Was the “mother of all scammers”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Was a “very manipulative person”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Had regularly committed adultery with a customer (a “white man”) with the ulterior motive of securing a green card,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Had adopted “disgusting, despicable, wicked and scheming” ways to fake her virginity when she met the Respondent,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Had chosen to rent an expensive apartment to stay in instead of paying $300 for a helper to care for their daughter, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Had forged the Respondent’s signature on several contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     According to the Respondent, he did not do anything wrong by sending the Email to his case officer. Further, he contended that the relevant information was “facts, not fabrications”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Threshold issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It cannot seriously be disputed that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Email would annoy the Applicant given the nature of its contents. The fact that the email had such an effect had been confirmed by the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The attacks on her character were repeated in the relatively long email are thus “continual”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent must have known that the Email was likely to cause anguish to the Applicant when he sent it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Given the above, the Respondent’s act of sending the Email can come within limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of Charter. For a discussion of limb (d), see <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Respondent’s contention (see [15] above) raises the following issue – Does the fact that the Email was sent to the Respondent’s <em>case officer</em> take it out of the definition of family violence? (“<b>Issue</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the answer to the Issue turns on two factors: <em>One</em>, in what context did the Respondent send the Email? <em>Two</em>, was the Email motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish? Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>In what context did the Respondent send the Email</em>. Clearly, the context of the communication is important. For instance, candid statements made in good faith during counselling or mediation should not ordinarily be construed as family violence. To hold otherwise will discourage candour during such sessions and frustrate genuine attempts at resolving personal and family issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Was the Email motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish</em>. Apart from the context, it is also relevant to consider whether the Email was motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish. The law should not allow a person – under the guise of counselling and mediation – to launch malicious attacks on a family member’s character or to cause anguish. Considerations that can shed light on whether there are ulterior motives behind a statement include the following: (i) Is the statement unsolicited, (ii) What is its tone, and (iii) Has the statement been forwarded to third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum-up, the Respondent’s act of sending the Email to his case officer can come within the definition of family violence unless the Email –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Was sent in a genuine effort to resolve a personal or family issue,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Was not motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Given that the facts in (a) and (b) above are especially within the Respondent’s knowledge, he has the burden of proving these facts: s 103(1) and s 108 of the Evidence Act 1893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applying the considerations </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Respondent had failed to prove the facts in [20(a)] and [20(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Email was not made in the context of mediation or counselling – but was a request to change the Respondent’s case officer. The Respondent made this request because he had felt that the case officer was biased against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Email was laced with vitriol and personal attacks against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent ended the Email with the ominous statement, “<em>From now onwards, I will not hesitate to tell anyone about [the Applicant]</em>”. This reveals an intention to disseminate further disparaging remarks to other persons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In these circumstances, the Email falls squarely within limb (d) of “family violence”: continual harassment likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 15 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The next incident occurred on 15 July 2024. On that day, the Respondent had gone to the Geylang and Jalan Besar salons looking for the Applicant. She was not present as she overseas at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     “T” was working at the Geylang Salon when the Respondent (a) approached her, (b) called her the Applicant’s dog, and (c) aggressively accused the Applicant of having slept with her customers and owed him a lot of money. When he began to threaten “T”, she called for the Police. He left before they arrived at the scene. According to “T”, the incident caused her to be fearful as she was concerned that the Respondent might return to the premises and threaten her again. In fact, she was so stressed by the experience that she could not sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At about 6.00 pm, the Respondent approached “N” at the Jalan Besar Salon. He pointed his finger at her and said loudly that he was looking for the Applicant. She told him that the Applicant was not at the premises. At the material time, “N” was worried for her safety as there was no one else in the salon. The Respondent later stepped outside and stopped persons from entering the salon. He left shortly thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Respondent denied the allegations by “T” and “N”. He admitted to having gone to the Jalan Besar Salon sometime in mid-July 2024 with the intention of “reminding” the Applicant about the loan. She was however not around.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Respondent called “P” – who was present in the Geylang Salon at the material time – to testify about the incident. According to her, there were no customer at the area where the Respondent was standing, and the workers were chatting with one another. Before leaving, he asked “T” whether she wanted to lodge a police report about his visit. When the latter said no, he left. The Respondent was in the salon for less than five minutes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I find the evidence of “T” and “N” to be more credible and reliable that that of the Respondent and “P”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on the Respondent’s account of the visits, they were uneventful. To accept his account, I must find that the Applicant had instigated <em>two</em> of her employees to falsely testify that he had visited <em>two</em> salons on the same day to create disturbances. I do not find this to be likely. If the Applicant had wanted to fabricate false evidence against the Respondent, it would have been far easier for her to come up with a simpler narrative – e.g., that he had created a scene at just one of the salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the following lend credibility to the evidence by “T” and “N”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       They gave consistent evidence that the Respondent (1) had entered their salons <em>at different times of the same day</em>, (2) had demanded to see the Applicant, and (3) was <em>aggressive</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Their evidence that the Respondent was upset and had accused the Applicant of cheating is consistent with the undisputed fact that there was a financial dispute between the two of them (involving $20,000) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Their evidence that the Respondent had created a scene at the salons and made disparaging remarks about the Applicant is also consistent with (1) the events that had happened earlier when he visited the Geylang Salon (on 3 July 2024) and (2) the contents of his email to his case officer (on 12 July 2024): see [12(c)] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I declined to give weight to “P”’s evidence given that her neutrality had been called into question: see [12(f)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 16 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     One day after his visit to the salons, the Respondent posted a one-star review about the Applicant’s restaurant at Marina One and one of her salons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In his review about the restaurant, he hinted that its business was not doing well and that its positive reviews could have been faked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for his review of the salon, he commented that its owner was in debt and that readers would be signing packages at their own risk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     According to the Respondent –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had the right to express the comments in his two reviews.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     These comments were true as they were based on the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He had learnt from his friend that the Applicant had asked her to provide a positive review.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Applicant had given discounts to customers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       She had also used their daughter’s Facebook account to generate positive reviews for her businesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Applicant had denied the allegations in [30(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Respondent bore the burden of proving the truth of his disparaging reviews. I find that he had failed to discharge this burden.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, he did not call the alleged friend who supplied the information.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, he did not produce any evidence to show that the Applicant had used her daughter’s Facebook account to generate positive reviews for her businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, the reviews went beyond a mere commentary on the services provided by the Applicant’s business. They attacked her <em>personal</em> creditworthiness and were clearly intended to tarnish her reputation. I therefore find that the Respondent committed family violence within s 64(d).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 23 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I now come to the final incident. This occurred on 23 July 2024. It is common ground that the Respondent had gone to the Geylang Salon at about 9.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     According to the Applicant –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She immediately called the Police upon seeing him at the salon. This was because of the past incidents when he had created a scene at her salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the presence of the workers and customers, the Respondent (i) pointed his finger at the Applicant, (ii) loudly claimed that he was there to collect $20,000 from her, and (iii) accused her of being a prostitute, being indebted to a lot of people, and having committed adultery while she was still married to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent had also harassed the customers as they were leaving the salon – by (i) stopping them outside the premises and (ii) telling them that she slept with customers and cheated money, and not to patronise her salon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Respondent denied the Applicant’s account of the events. According to him –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no customer in the salon at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had merely asked the Applicant to return the $20,000 and told her that if she refused to pay, he would hire a lawyer or a debt collector.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To protect himself from false allegations by the Applicant, he had suggested to her that she make a police report. He then waited outside the salon to wait for the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Police arrived, the Respondent suggested to them to view the salon’s CCTV and to arrest him if he had committed any act of violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to “P” –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent had arrived at the salon at around 9.30 pm. As the salon was closing, there was no customer at the premises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent spoke briefly to the Applicant, suggested that the latter call for the Police, and waved at the CCTV. The Applicant then called the Police. The Respondent waited outside the salon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the Police arrived, they spoke to the Applicant and Respondent separately. The Respondent subsequently left without entering the salon again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I preferred the Applicant’s account of the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is common ground that the Applicant had called for the Police. Her action is consistent with someone who had acted out of genuine distress and concern for her safety at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such distress and concern are supported by the fact that the Respondent had both <em>motive</em> to cause her harm (animosity with the Applicant for refusing to return $20,000 and for allegedly deceiving him about her virginity) and <em>prior history of harassment</em> (of creating disturbances at her salons and sending disparaging emails and messages against her).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “P”’s testimony did not undermine the Applicant’s evidence. This is because “P” was not at the front of the salon and thus unable to witness the interaction between the Applicant and the Respondent at the material time. On “P”’s own evidence, she had gone to a room at the back of the salon and had <em>shut the door</em> while the Applicant and the Respondent were at the front of the salon. The room was about 10 m away from the front of premises.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I wish to address the three points raised by the Respondent in his evidence and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">CCTV recordings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is not disputed that CCTV were installed at the Geylang and Jalan Besar salons. During the trial, the Applicant did not produce the CCTV recordings to support her case that the Respondent had caused a scene at her salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Respondent submitted that the Applicant ought to have produced these recordings as they could objectively prove what had transpired at the salons at the material times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Additionally, he submitted that (a) he would not have intentionally created a scene at these premises knowing that this would be recorded by the CCTV, and (b) it was “unbelievable” that the CCTV recordings at two different premises were not retrievable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I accept that the Applicant’s failure to produce the relevant CCTV recordings presents a potential weakness in her case regarding the incidents on 3, 15 and 23 July.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, I find that the absence of these recordings is not fatal to her case. This is because she had explained that the recordings could not be found and that they might no longer be available due to the passage of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Further, I note that her case is supported by credible witness testimony (from the Applicant, “N” and “T”) and corroborated by the Respondent’s emails and messages: see [12(d)], [14], and [29] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged motive for seeking a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The second point concerns the reason for the PPO application. The Respondent contended that the Applicant had made a false PPO application to justify securing the custody, care, and control of their daughter. He believed that she had wanted such arrangements for the child to improve her chances of getting Singapore citizenship. Additionally, he believed that the Applicant had wanted a PPO to deter him from recovering $20,000 from her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am not persuaded by the Respondent’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I find them to be highly speculative, unsubstantiated by admissible evidence, and raised belatedly only in closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The evidence revealed that the Applicant originally did <em>not</em> intend to apply for a PPO. About two months before the application (i.e. on 15 August 2024), her solicitors had issued a cease-and-desist letter to warn the Respondent against committing further acts of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In October 2024, he disregarded this warning by sending a disparaging email about the Applicant to her partner. The PPO application was filed only after this email. If the Respondent did not send this email, the Applicant would not have applied for the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The PPO application is amply supported by, among others, objective evidence in the form of the Respondent’s emails and messages. These contained offensive comments about the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged collusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     This conveniently brings me to the last point raised by the Respondent. He submitted that the evidence of “N” and “T” are unreliable – contending that they contained “inconsistencies”, were “orchestrated”, and were given at the bidding of the Applicant (their employer) due to their close relationship with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I do not find any material inconsistency in “N”’s and “T”’s evidence. The inconsistencies alluded to by the Respondent do not undermine the core of their evidence – i.e., that he had caused disturbances at the salons during the relevant incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent’s submission of collusion among the witnesses relates only to the 3 and 15 July incidents. (For the other incidents, the supporting evidence is based on the Respondent’s emails and messages.) For the reasons set out in [12] and [28] above, I find that it is unlikely that the Applicant, “N”, and “T” had colluded to give false evidence regarding the Respondent’s visits to the salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     To re-cap – I have found that on five occasions in July 2024, the Respondent had engaged in conduct that amounted to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The question is whether a PPO is necessary. In my view, it is.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant testified that she has been distressed and fearful for her safety and livelihood. This fear is well-founded given the Respondent’s repeated harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent had showed no remorse for his conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He claimed that he was “telling the truth” and correcting the misinformation that the Applicant had spread about him. Such a bare claim is clearly disingenuous. He had failed to produce any evidence to support it. It is also unclear how creating a scene at the Applicant’s business premises and sending random and unsolicited emails, messages, and adverse one-star reviews can correct the alleged misinformation about him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Respondent had no qualm about making serious accusations against the Applicant without any basis. For instance, he claimed that she had committed adultery and had refused to return a $100,000-loan she took from a businessman.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, when asked for his evidence to support these claims, he admitted that he did not have any.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Respondent continued to publish offensive statements about the Applicant even after her solicitors had issued him a cease-and-desist letter in August 2024. On 7 October 2024, he sent a lengthy email to the Applicant’s partner in which he repeated his accusations that she was a cheat, a “FAKE VIRGIN”, and a prostitute. He had also (1) provided details of his sexual intercourse with the Applicant, (2) accused her of cheating government agencies, (3) expressed his intention to “bash up” the partner for engaging in an adulterous relationship with her, and (4) threatened to publish his story about the Applicant as he “wanted people in different industries to see her true colors”. (exhibit C2) During cross-examination, the Respondent admitted that his intention of sending the 7 October 2024 email was to shame the Applicant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       At the time of the trial, the Respondent continued to harbour deep resentment towards the Applicant and an intent to embarrass her. For instance, he repeated his accusations that the Applicant had faked her virginity and was a cheat in his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       As evident from above, the Respondent’s conduct was not an isolated lapse but part of an escalating pattern. They are clearly vindictive and reprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is a real risk of further conflict and harassment if no protective order is in place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the time of this decision, the issue of the $20,000 payment – which is the one of the key triggers for the family violence in this case – remains unresolved. The Respondent knew that there were the “legal” means for recovering the $20,000 from the Applicant – either through a lawyer or a licensed debt collector.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Despite this knowledge, he turned to pressure tactics to recover the money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The parties will also need to interact with each other to facilitate the Applicant’s access to their daughter. Based on the evidence at the trial, this is yet another potential source of conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Accordingly, I order that the Respondent is not to use family violence in any form against the Applicant. The PPO shall take immediate effect. Further, I order that the Respondent is to pay costs of $4,000 to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Before concluding, I wish to address the following message to the Respondent directly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is an offence to breach this order. If you intentionally do so, you may be arrested and punished with a fine or imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You know that lawful means exist to recover debts. Do not take the law into your own hands.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the trial, you have repeatedly justified your actions by claiming that you were simply telling the truth. The law requires that if you make allegations, you must prove them with admissible evidence. Bare assertions are insufficient and can expose you to liability for harassment, breach of PPO, or defamation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Your marriage ended more than two years ago. It is time to move on. I urge you to put aside your bitterness and focus on your daughter’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Sending vulgar emails and messages – e.g., that you visit prostitutes and that the Applicant is one – serves no purpose but to poison the environment in which your daughter is growing up. She will need both parents to provide stability in her life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, your daughter is now about ten years old. As she enters adolescence, she will need the help and guidance – including how to resolve inter-personal conflicts. I hope that you will contribute positively to her life – including by setting a good example of how reasonable people should behave.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit dated 10.12.24 at [15] to [19]: see Complainant’s Bundle of Affidavits at Tab A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Respondent’s letter to the Court dated 10.12.24 (exhibit R1).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>AN’s Affidavit dated 10.12.24 at [7] to [8]: see Complainant’s Bundle of Affidavits at Tab C.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit dated 10.12.24 at [20]: see Complainant’s Bundle of Affidavits at Tab A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit dated 10.12.24 at page 13 and 14: see Complainant’s Bundle of Affidavits at Tab A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Respondent’s letter to the Court dated 10.12.24 and his evidence in court.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>The messages were sent just five days after the 3 July incident.

This was XQV’s application against XQW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There were a total of 5 parties across these 6 applications. They were split into two camps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On one side, there was XQW and XQY. On the other was XQV, XQX and XQZ. At the trial before me, XQW and XQY were acting in person. Mr Patrick Fernandez (“Mr Fernandez”) acted for XQV, XQX and XQZ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties had been involved in a scuffle that had taken place at Changi General Hospital on 13 March 2024. They had gone to see Mr M, who was the patriarch of the family. They ran into each other. Tempers flared. It is alleged that punches were thrown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       During trial, parties presented competing narratives of what had actually happened that day and the injuries they had suffered. Apart from this incident, there are also other complaints. For instance, XQY alleged that XQV and XQZ had shouted Tamil expletives at her previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While much effort had been expended on whether family violence had actually been committed, the major fault line running through all six applications lay in whether it was indeed necessary to order a PPO. It is clear from the jurisprudence of our family courts that even if the court finds that family violence had been committed, a PPO may not be issued if the court finds that it is not necessary to protect the person in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In this connection, it is well-established law that in assessing necessity, the court is undertaking a risk assessment as to the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence, in the future, on the person for whom the PPO is sought. Factors that the court will weigh in its assessment include the likelihood of interactions between the parties, whether the underlying cause for family violence has been resolved, and factors that are specific to the respondent (for instance, where the respondent is deeply antagonistic, or where the respondent has a propensity for violence): <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20] – [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There was, in my judgment, a low risk of parties committing family violence on each other in the future. For one, it was clear to me that parties are not living together. They also do not meet occasionally, and indeed, it was clear to me that the only reason that led to the filing of these 6 PPO applications was that parties had run into each other when they went to visit the patriarch, Mr M, in hospital.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That they did not share a common space, and did not meet frequently was also, in my judgment, a significant factor pointing to there being a low risk of parties committing family violence on each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     While it was indeed true that parties may run into each other when go to visit Mr M, I did not consider this to be a factor pointing to an elevated risk of parties committing family violence on each other. The evidence before me did not show that parties would regularly run into each other whenever they went to visit Mr M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To sum up, all six applications were dismissed. None of the parties had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that it was indeed necessary for a PPO to be ordered for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for costs, Mr Fernandez submitted that XQZ should be entitled to costs against XQY (for SS 522), and that XQV should be entitled to costs against XQY (for SS 523). That is because XQY’s application against both XQZ and XQC had been dismissed, and given that neither XQZ or XQV had filed cross-applications, XQZ and XQV should be entitled to costs as they had succeeded in defending against XQY’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As to the quantum of costs, Mr Fernandez submitted that it should be fixed at $4000 (all-in) for SS 522. Mr Fernandez also sought the same quantum of costs for SS 523. In relation to the other four applications, Mr Fernandez sought no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, XQY said that she was not in a position to pay costs. She also said it was not fair to make her pay “damages” especially considering how XQV had behaved towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Insofar as XQY speaks of “damages” – it must be emphasised that costs are not damages, and that no damages are awarded in the wake of a PPO trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     As a starting point, given that SS 522 and 523 were dismissed, and there were no cross-applications, XQZ and XQV would be entitled to costs. However, the reality of the litigation before me was that, as I have noted, parties were split into two camps with XQW and XQY on one side, and XQV, XQX and XQZ on the other. Given that I had dismissed all six applications, it may be said that there was no winner between the two camps. Any costs order made should be reflective of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I therefore made no order as to costs in respect of all 6 applications.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial proceedings – Jurisdiction – Whether stay of ancillary proceedings may be granted when interim judgment has been granted","Conflict of laws – Natural forum – Stay of proceedings – Whether Singapore court is an appropriate forum in light of concurrent foreign proceedings","Conflict of laws – Natural forum – Restraint of foreign proceedings – Whether anti-suit injunction should be granted to restrain concurrent foreign custody proceedings"],"date":"2025-08-22","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 2786 of 2024, (Summons Nos. 940 and 1243 of 2025)","title":"XQN v XQO","citation":"[2025] SGFC 92","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33781-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Lim Bee Li and Mr Kurzbock Tsang Yu Han Kenn (Chevalier Law LLC) for the Plaintiff-Husband","Mr. Ong Yong Cheng, Desmond (DMO Law Corporation) for the Defendant-Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-09-09T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XQN v XQO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQN <em>v</em> XQO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33781-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 92</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Briefly:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband commenced FC/D 2786/2024 (“D 2786”) on 12 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Shortly thereafter, on 2 July 2024, the Husband filed an application seeking an urgent injunction to prevent the Wife from bringing the parties’ children, [AR] and [AN] (collectively, the “Children”), out of Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     However, by the time that application could be properly heard, the Wife had already brought to the Children to Canada on 2 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_d\"></a>(d)     6 days later, on 8 July 2024, the Wife filed FC/SUM 2143/2024 (“SUM 2143”) seeking permission from the Family Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> to bring the Children to Canada, and to reside there until the resolution of D 2786.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 14 August 2024, the Husband filed an application with the Canadian court for the return of the Children pursuant to the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (25 October 1980) (“1980 Hague Convention”). The Husband’s counsel referred to this application as the “<em>Hague Application</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Hague Application was eventually dismissed by Justice A.M. Daurio of the Superior Court of Ontario on 31 October 2024. The Canadian court had found that the Children’s habitual residence was Canada and not Singapore, and thus no return order would be granted. The Husband’s counsel referred to this as the “<em>Hague Ruling</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_g\"></a>(g)     I should add that there appears to have been an appeal filed by the Husband against the Hague Ruling, but this appeal had since been “abandoned” by way of a Notice of Abandonment dated 7 March 2025 filed by the Husband in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Notwithstanding the Hague Application, the parties proceeded with D 2786 and had attended mediation in the FJC. Both parties reached an agreement on the grounds for the divorce, and they filed their respective amended statement of particulars and counterclaim, on 15 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_i\"></a>(i)     The matter was fixed for uncontested divorce hearing and Interim Judgment for Divorce was eventually granted on 25 November 2025 (“IJ”). For present purpose, it is important to note that the IJ was granted almost 1 month <em>after</em> the Hague Ruling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_j\"></a>(j)     After IJ was granted, the parties and/or counsel then attended case conferences for D 2786 to receive directions for the filing of affidavits and documents to prepare the case for the eventual ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing in the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_k\"></a>(k)     By this time, the Wife had filed proceedings in Canada for orders relating to the care of the Children on 9 January 2025 (“Canadian Proceedings”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_l\"></a>(l)     This, in turn, resulted in the Husband applying for an anti-suit injunction (or “ASI”), <em>vide</em>. FC/SUM 940/2025 (“SUM 940”) which was met by the Wife filing FC/SUM 1243/2025 (“SUM 1243”) seeking a stay of further proceedings in D 2786.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is with the above context that this Court will consider SUM 940 and SUM 1243.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1243: Stay on the Ground of Forum Non Conveniens</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I will start with SUM 1243, which is the Wife’s application entitled “<em>Summons for Stay of Proceedings (Forum Non Conveniens)</em>” seeking <em>inter alia</em> the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1</em>.     <em>That all further proceedings in FC/D 2786/2024 be stayed;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>2</em>.     <em>That the Ancillary Matters in the said proceedings in FC/D 2786/2024 be stayed;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>3</em>.     <em>That the Final Judgment of Divorce pursuant to the Interim Judgment dated 25 November 2024 be withheld or deferred;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[…]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It would be immediately apparent from a perusal of SUM 1243 that there is some uncertainty as to what exactly is being sought by the Wife – is she seeking a stay of the <em>entire</em> proceedings, or just the AM “part” of the proceedings? SUM 1243 prayed for <em>both</em> reliefs, but both cannot be granted together, or even in the alternative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ultimately, the lack of clarity in the prayers sought may well be moot as I am of the view that neither would succeed in the present case. In my view, both prayers 1 and 2 of SUM 1243 suffer from several fatal flaws. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       First, assuming the Wife seeks a stay of the <em>entire</em> proceedings (<em>per</em> prayer 1 of SUM 1243), her case runs up firmly against the fact that IJ has been obtained <em>by consent</em> between the parties. As alluded to above, IJ was granted on <em>both</em> the Husband’s claim, and the Wife’s counterclaim. Both parties filed amended pleadings, and the Court granted IJ accordingly. Both sought AM reliefs from the Family Court, and these were adjourned to Chambers for determination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The present case is – in a sense – similar to the situation in <em>XFS v XFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a> (“<em>XFS”</em>) which was cited by the Husband’s counsel. In <em>XFS</em>, this Court had opined that where the parties had submitted to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction – eg., by seeking to have IJ granted by consent with each party filing their claim and counterclaim, and with the AM reliefs adjourned to be determined in Chambers – it was no longer open for one party to seek a stay of the same proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Put simply, it is no longer open for the Wife to argue that there exists another available forum which is more appropriate than Singapore (as required in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] 1 AC 460</a>, <em>ie.</em> the oft-cited “<em>Spiliada</em> test”) when she had availed herself to the Family Court’s jurisdiction by seeking an IJ to end the marriage, in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In the present case, there was no attempt by the Wife to reserve her position on the issue of the Family Court’s jurisdiction (whether by stating as such in her pleadings, or by filing an application to stay D 2786 prior to the grant of IJ). She has thus waived her right to now – rather belatedly – seek a stay of the present proceedings (whether wholly, or in part).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the Wife’s submission to the Family Court’s jurisdiction alone would be sufficient to dispose of SUM 1243, I should also point out that the issue of whether the Court could stay one <em>part</em> of the divorce proceedings was discussed in <em>XFS</em>. In <em>XFS</em>, I had noted in <em>dicta</em> that AM proceedings are inextricably linked to the grant of an IJ and that AM reliefs cannot be easily “severed” from the main proceedings in the same way civil/commercial causes of action in tort and contract could, and for part of these AM reliefs to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To assist the Court on this issue, prior to the hearing of the parties’ applications, I had directed both counsel to address the question of whether the Children Issues in the present AM proceedings can be stayed independently from the other AM reliefs sought. At the hearing on 18 July 2025, the Husband’s counsel candidly explained that despite their efforts and legal research, they could not locate any precedent where such an approach was taken. Counsel for the Wife similarly did not point me to any such precedent in their submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The lack of precedents illustrates the difficulty with prayer 2 of SUM 1243 which sought a partial stay of only the AM proceedings. While not dispositive, I express my scepticism as to whether such an approach would be possible in the absence of express agreement between the parties, particularly in relation to an application to stay only the Children’s Issues while the parties continue to pursue the other AM reliefs in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As I had alluded to in <em>XFS</em>, s 123(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) expressly provides that Final Judgment for the divorce shall not be granted by the Family Court unless arrangements have been made for the welfare of the children (save in specific situations). Staying the Children Issues indefinitely in favour of a foreign jurisdiction may create a challenge for the parties in making the divorce granted in Singapore final.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For completeness, I note that Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> (“<em>Low Wing Hong Alvin</em>”) had held as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[…] I consider it important that the court deciding the divorce and ancillary matters should consider the issue of custody and care and control at the same time. The cause of the breakdown of the marriage could be relevant in the decision on custody as well as on division of matrimonial assets. In my view it is more important that the <em>same court</em> consider and decide these matters than to divide the issues to be decided in <em>separate courts simply because the assets are in another jurisdiction</em> […]”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     His Honour’s observations appear to suggest the <em>possibility</em> that courts in different jurisdictions can potentially decide different aspects of a divorce case but that it is a matter of good practice for one court to hear both the divorce and AM proceedings. However, the issue of the severability and/or the grant of a partial stay of AM reliefs was not before the High Court in that case and, more importantly, interim judgment had not yet been granted in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin</em> and one party had applied to stay the entire divorce action on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The question of severability of AM reliefs was also not considered in the subsequent case of <em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a> (“<em>ALJ</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In <em>ALJ</em>, there was similarly no formal application by the parties in that case for a stay of only the AM proceedings on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. However, the husband had raised a preliminary argument, in the course of the AM hearing, that the Californian courts should hear the ancillary matters (including the children’s issues) and that he had only commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore so that he could obtain custodial orders to bring the children to California.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In dismissing the husband’s argument, Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) noted in passing that where interim judgment has already been granted in Singapore, His Honour considered “<em>it more appropriate for the ancillaries to be resolved here also</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Woo J further held that if the husband’s intention of starting divorce proceedings was to obtain a “temporary” order to bring the children back to California, then he should have “<em>made his decision clear from the start and </em><em><u>not proceed all the way to obtain interim judgment</u></em> [emphasis added]”. Thus, <em>ALJ</em> fortifies my view that once IJ had been obtained, it is no longer open to one party to seek a stay of the remainder of the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In fact, recognising the challenge brought about by her decision to obtain IJ in Singapore, the Wife (in her affidavit) suggested that a separate agreement can be reached between the parties to first set-aside the IJ, discontinue all proceedings relating to D 2786, and thereafter for the parties to explore fresh divorce proceedings in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I say no more of this (rather surprising) argument save that such an approach (if it was even possible) could only be achieved with the Husband’s express agreement. The Court certainly cannot <em>order</em> that the IJ or D 2786 be set-aside save for the circumstances envisaged under the WC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In any event, the Husband has confirmed – through his counsel – that he does not agree to do so, and the Wife’s entire argument therefore became moot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ultimately, it is not necessary for this Court to definitively deal with the issue of the severability of AM reliefs and/or splitting the same amongst multiple jurisdictions, given the Wife’s decision to obtain IJ in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Before I conclude this aspect of the discussion of SUM 1243, I wish to address an issue which had unfortunately creeped into the present case, <em>viz</em>. the Wife’s assertion that if the Family Court proceeds with the AM proceedings (in particular, the Children’s Issues), the Court would be acting in breach of (or be inconsistent with) the Canadian’s courts determination as regards the return of the Children. The Wife also alluded to the possible failure of the Family Court to respect Singapore’s international obligations or, the comity of nations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> These are serious claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Although I do not strictly need to engage these arguments given my view that the Wife has not succeeded in her application for a stay based on her own submission to the Family Court’s jurisdiction, I find it necessary to make some brief observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With respect, I do not agree with the Wife’s arguments relating to the issue of comity. What is important to understand is that both Singapore and Canada are signatories to the 1980 Hague Convention. The central object of the 1980 Hague Convention is the <em>prompt return</em> of children wrongfully retained in a contracting state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the present case, the Husband had filed the Hague Application seeking the return of the Children to Singapore because he is of the view that Singapore was the place of the children’s habitual residence. The Canadian court did not agree with him, and thus did not order the Children’s return to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Canadian court’s decision does not directly affect the Singapore court’s legal power or authority to determine the Children’s Issues. As I had highlighted earlier, <em>both</em> parties consented to the Family Court granting IJ and both parties asked that the AM reliefs be adjourned to be determined <em>in Singapore</em>. What is even more concerning is the fact that the Wife had previously filed SUM 2143 in the Family Court seeking a <em>relocation</em> order for the Children to stay with her in Canada. SUM 2143 was filed after the Children were already brought to Canada. In other words, all of her <em>own actions</em> recognise that the Family Court <em>can</em> (in the sense that it has the authority to) make decisions involving the Children’s upbringing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is therefore unclear the legal basis under which the Wife now claims that the Family Court is somehow not competent or vested with legal authority to make such determinations. <em>How</em> the Family Court would do so given the Canadian court’s decision is a separate matter, which I will address later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, while there are other international conventions relating to the determination of the appropriate jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition of matters pertaining to parental responsibility, Singapore is a signatory to only the 1980 Hague Convention (which does not deal with such matters).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 940: Anti-Suit Injunction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I come now to the Husband’s application in SUM 940 for an ASI.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In essence, an ASI, in the context of the present proceedings, is an <em>in personam</em> order issued by the Family Court ordering one litigant to refrain from instituting and/or continuing foreign legal proceedings against the other litigant in relation to the same matter which is already before the Singapore court: see <em>PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18174-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 873</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As the Court of Appeal had noted in <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/28897-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 2 SLR 380</a> (“<em>VEW</em>”) (a case involving the grant of an ASI in the context of family proceedings), the principles relating to the grant of an ASI are trite, and involve the following considerations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “<em>ends of justice</em>” require it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     where the court decides to grant an injunction restraining proceedings in a foreign court, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     an injunction will only be issued restraining a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Factors which the Court must consider include:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (i) whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court; (ii) whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties; (iii) whether the foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiff if allowed to continue; (iv) whether the ASI would cause any injustice to the defendant by depriving the defendant of legitimate juridical advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; and (v) whether the institution of foreign proceedings was or would be in breach of any agreement between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     These same principles were also canvassed by the Husband in his counsel’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     While the principles are not generally in dispute, the parties disagreed on their application. Central to the Husband’s case is that the Family Court is the appropriate forum for the Children Issues to be determined, and his belief that these issues should be dealt with in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Singapore’s availability as a forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In my view, that the Family Court has the jurisdiction to hear the AM proceedings (including the Children Issues) is clear. I have already canvassed this issue when considering the Wife’s application to stay D 2786.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Wife is clearly amenable to the Family Court’s jurisdiction having expressly submitted to its jurisdiction (by filing a counterclaim and seeking IJ from the Court). She may now have “changed” her mind and wants to have certain proceedings in Canada, but this does not change the fact that she had already submitted to the Family Court’s jurisdiction. For the same reason, I accept that Singapore is the appropriate forum to resolve the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Vexation, oppression, and an injustice</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     What then about the other factors? Would the Canadian Proceedings – if proceeded with – result in vexation, oppression and/or injustice to the Husband? He seems to believe that it would.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     With regard to the issue of vexation and oppression – the Court of Appeal in <em>VEW</em> had noted that this determination is based on a number of non-exhaustive factor. The strength (or weakness) of the foreign claim is one consideration but there are others. These include whether the foreign proceedings are an attack on the Husband’s rights, or are duplicative of the Singapore proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It is on these latter points which the Husband had hinged a significant part of his argument. He submits that the timing of the commencement of the Canadian Proceedings, the late stage of the present AM proceedings, and duplicative nature of both proceedings, point towards the grant of an ASI.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I have difficulties accepting these points. The challenge I have with the Husband’s characterisation of the Wife’s Canadian Proceedings is that it fails to consider the <em>reality</em> that the Children are now living in Canada with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Canadian court has already refused to make a Hague return order, having determined that the Children’s habitual residence had always been in Canada. The Husband could have pressed on with his appeal against this decision. He chose to abandon his appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As parties cannot agree on what the appropriate arrangement for the Children should be, the Wife started the Canadian Proceedings. Her actions are not unreasonable since the <em>enforcement</em> of any care or access arrangement would be a matter best dealt with at the place of the Children’s residence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     To put matters in context, when the Children were in Singapore, the Husband too first approached the Family Court to seek injunctive relief. That makes sense since the court where the Children are physically located would be in a good position to grant relief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     When seen from this perspective, the grant of an ASI may in fact <em>prejudice</em> the proper enforcement of any child access or care arrangement made for the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Consider this: even if a <em>Singapore</em> court had issued an access order, court proceedings would still need to be commenced in the foreign court for such orders to be mirrored, and thereafter for the necessary enforcement to be carried out should there be non-compliance. Barring any reciprocal enforcement arrangement, the Family Court’s orders will not be automatically or directly enforced within another country’s territories and jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I note that the Husband points to the “expanded” scope of the Wife’s Canadian Proceedings (beyond the issue of a Hague return order) to support his claim that the proceedings are vexatious and oppressive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Yet, I do not see how the reliefs sought was necessarily unreasonable or oppressive. Given that the Children are actually <em>living in Canada</em>, it is not unreasonable for the Wife to seek relief from a court familiar with the Children day-to-day living expenses and cost of living.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Doing so, in and of itself, would not render such proceedings vexatious or oppressive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Indeed, one must consider how would preventing the Canadian Proceedings be of any help to either party, including the Husband himself. If the Husband will have to eventually avail himself to further court applications in Canada in order to put into effect any orders made by the Family Court, how would stopping the Wife’s present Canadian Proceedings save time and costs for the parties?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The only difference in the situations envisaged above may be that the Husband would presumably have a Singapore court order (which he finds favourable) by the time he has to file subsequent recognition proceedings in Canada. However, an ASI is not granted to help one party obtain what he may perceive to be favourable order first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Underlying the above factors is one additional (and important) consideration, <em>ie.</em> the <em>welfare</em> of the Children. It has been long recognised that the welfare principle has a role to play in cases involving the stay of proceedings on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I agree with both counsel that the Husband’s ASI application and the Wife’s stay application have, at their cores, the same considerations. Thus the same welfare principle should apply to both.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While I do not agree with the Wife that the Children’s welfare necessarily means that a stay of D 2786 ought to be granted, similarly, I am of the view that the Children’s best interests also mean that the Canadian Proceedings should not be stopped by having an ASI issued against the Wife. Doing so would create an ambiguity as to how the Children and the parties ought to conduct themselves <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Children’s access and care arrangements in Canada (where they now live).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Having weighed the relevant factors, I therefore find that the Husband has not shown that the “<em>ends of justice</em>” requires the grant of an ASI against the Wife. SUM 940 is accordingly dismissed as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The way forward?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As my eventual decision is that neither SUM 940 nor SUM 1243 is granted, the parties’ respective position would be where it was before the applications were filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     This means that they continue to be in the midst of the case management process to prepare their cases and the evidence they seek to rely on, for the eventual AM proceedings (which would be heard by the Family Court).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I acknowledge that the present situation is unique in that many of the previously decided cases dealt with standalone issues, for eg.:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the High Court (Family Division) in <em>TDX</em> and <em>TGT</em> was concerned with the stay of Singapore guardianship proceedings outside of a marital relationship (and so no issue of divorce or the financial arrangements consequent thereof were dealt with);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> and the Family Court in <em>XLN v XLM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33214-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 47</a> dealt with applications to stay independent maintenance proceedings brought under Part 8 of the WC; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     other High Court and Family Court decisions (such as <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin</em> and <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a>) dealt with stay applications for the entire divorce proceedings, and not a <em>part</em> of AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     However, there is no question that many of the AM reliefs sought in D 2678 continue to be relevant before the Family Court. For example, it is clear that having obtained IJ here in Singapore, there needs to be a division of the parties’ Singapore matrimonial assets, including their Housing and Development Board flat and Central Provident Fund monies. The division, sale and/or disposal of many of these assets cannot be done by order of a foreign court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     What then about the Children’s Issues? Does it mean that if the Singapore proceedings are not stayed, and the Canadian Proceedings are not stopped, that there would necessarily be a conflict which remains unresolvable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In my view, the alleged concerns articulated by the parties <em>vis-à-vis</em> the risk of conflicting judgment and/or comity may be more apparent than real in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I find that the AM proceedings for D 2678 can continue despite the existence of other proceedings in Canada. It is not uncommon for divorce proceedings to be afoot in another jurisdiction but one or both parties seek interim relief from the Family Court on discrete issues of maintenance or visitation arrangements while the children are in Singapore and thus within the local court’s jurisdiction. The same situation applies vice-versa, <em>viz</em>. that the parties have divorce proceedings in Singapore, but also wish to have discrete proceedings on custodial or child support matters, overseas. The presence of concurrent proceedings in this limited context would not necessarily lead to conflicting or duplicative proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Parties are free to address the Family Court hearing the AM proceedings in Singapore on what orders may or may not have been made in the Canadian Proceedings, and the Family Court will consider them as part of the overall assessment of the appropriate orders to be made on the Children Issues. The subsequent application for mirror orders (or related applications) whether in Singapore or Canada is a <em>separate</em> matter which the court seized of the issue can deal with by an application of <em>domestic</em> family law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As a matter of case management, directions can be sought from the Family Court on the appropriate timelines and the filing of documents/evidence arising from the Canadian Proceedings if these can be shown to be relevant to the Family Court’s determination of the Children issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Such measures may well include the grant of a short-term and/or limited case management stay to prevent the making of inconsistent or contemporaneous orders by both jurisdictions, or for the determination of one or more AM reliefs <em>first</em> and leaving other reliefs to be determined at a later date. Such measures are not granted because the Family Court is not the appropriate forum, but as part of the court’s case management powers to address the risk of conflicting court decisions. However, these are matters which need not be addressed at the present moment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     For completeness, on 20 August 2025, the Wife’s solicitors filed an Other Hearing Related Request to inform the Court that the Wife had recently obtained what appeared to be further case management related orders in the Canadian Proceedings for the matter to be heard urgently on 1 October 2025. As the information was provided without input from the Husband or his solicitors, I did not take the same into account. In any event, these case management orders (or the scheduling of a hearing date) would not have had any material impact on my decision herein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While I have dismissed both applications, it remains open for both parties to reach an amicable resolution to some or all of the issues dealt with in the AM proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I would thus encourage both parties to consider their options and work with their counsel, with a Therapeutic Justice mindset. This would obviate many unnecessary arguments and contestations on the parenting matters while the Children are living overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Each party is to bear his or her own costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>I shall refer the question of the appropriate custody, care and control and access orders to be granted in respect of the parties’ children, as well as the appropriate maintenance and/or financial support to be made for them, collectively as the “<em>Children Issues</em>”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>In these Grounds of Decision, I shall refer to the Singapore Family Court and the Family Justice Courts, as the “Family Court” and “FJC”, respectively.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit dd 02.06.25 (“DA1”) at p. 46</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See <em>XFS</em> at [24];

The Plaintiff wife (“Wife”) is an American citizen and the Defendant husband (“Husband”) is a Singapore citizen. Interim Judgment was granted on 21 March 2024, based on the ground of 4 years’ separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       According to the agreed amended Statement of Particulars, the parties started living separately in December 2018, after only 9 (nine) months of marriage. However, the parties purchased their matrimonial home in the US sometime in September 2019, <em>after</em> they started living separately. The Wife left the matrimonial home sometime in June 2023 and subsequently moved to Japan, where she is currently residing. The Husband is still residing in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties had signed a pre-nuptial agreement in the US on 7 March 2018 (“the pre-nup agreement”) in contemplation of marriage, in which they agreed that the assets now owned or later acquired by either party would remain their own separate property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> - in other words, such assets would not be subject to division. The pre-nup agreement also stated that in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, neither party would seek “<em>any form of alimony or support</em>” from the other party. It is noted that both parties had the benefit of their own legal counsel in the US and both counsel had also signed and witnessed the pre-nup agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 3 April 2018, 2 weeks after the parties were married, they signed another agreement to supplement the terms in the pre-nup agreement (“the supplemental agreement”). The supplemental agreement provided that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> (i) in the event the Wife’s parents found out about the marriage and stopped paying for her college tuition, the Defendant husband (“Defendant”) would “<em>provide financial support to cover”</em> the Wife’s “<em>college tuition and reasonable rent</em>” for the remainder of her college studies; and (ii) the Wife shall provide the Husband “<em>the billing statement from the college she attends at the beginning of each semester</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Initially the Wife sought a just and equitable division of all the parties’ assets, and not just their matrimonial home. In the Wife’s submissions filed on 30 April 2025, she included all the assets in parties’ respective names in the matrimonial pool. At the first hearing on 28 May 2025, I directed the parties to file supplemental affidavits on the date of acquisition of parties’ respective assets and further submissions on <em>inter alia</em>, the date of determination of the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the subsequent hearing on 4 July 2025 before me, the Wife’s counsel clarified that the Wife was no longer seeking division of all matrimonial assets, but only division of the parties’ matrimonial home. Both parties agreed that they would retain other assets in their respective names and there would be no division of the same. In the circumstances, there is no need for me to examine the date of determination of the pool of matrimonial assets. The only disputed ancillary matters are (i) the division of the matrimonial home; (ii) maintenance for the Wife; and (iii) payment of certain sums claimed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       These are my orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i\"></a>(i)     The matrimonial home at xx Wilshire Blvd #xx, Los Angeles, California, USA is to be sold in the open market within one year of the date of Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_a\"></a>(a)       To make full payment of the outstanding mortgage loan;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_b\"></a>(b)       To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The balance sale proceeds to be divided 34.1% to the Plaintiff and 65.9% to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     Each party shall retain all other assets in their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     There shall be no maintenance for the Plaintiff with no liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The following are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal effect of foreign pre-nuptial agreements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As the Wife is no longer seeking division of parties’ assets other than the matrimonial home, there is no need for me to go into the terms of the parties’ pre-nup agreement regarding the division of matrimonial assets. However, as I will explain below, the Wife is choosing to rely on the terms of the supplemental agreement signed after the pre-nup agreement in her claim for maintenance or, more specifically, payment by the Husband for the Wife’s college tuition fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Both parties signed the pre-nup agreement in the US and it is for all intents and purposes a pre-nuptial agreement governed by US law. Assuming the pre-nup agreement is valid and enforceable in the US, what is its applicability in the Singapore divorce proceedings where parties have submitted to jurisdiction in Singapore and seek to have their ancillary matters decided in Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) 961, the court found that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> where a provision of the relevant statute expressly covers a certain category of prenuptial agreement, then that provision would be the governing law. However, if the statute is silent, then the legal status of the relevant prenuptial agreement will be governed by the common law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Where Singapore law is the governing law with respect to ancillary matters and there is a valid pre-nuptial agreement regarding the division of matrimonial assets which is governed by foreign law, the courts may consider<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, as part of all the circumstances of the case, the pre-nuptial agreement in arriving at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. The weight given to such a pre-nuptial agreement would depend on the precise facts and circumstances of the case. However, such an agreement cannot be enforced in and of itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Where the pre-nuptial agreement relates to spousal maintenance, in the absence of any applicable statutory provision, the common law principles would apply and the court would ascertain whether the terms of such agreement are just and fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Direct contributions to the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Parties’ matrimonial home is an apartment in California, US, which the parties purchased as joint tenants in September 2019, ostensibly <em>after</em> the parties had already started living separately. The Husband valued the property at USD565,231 while the Wife’s estimated valuation was USD582,960. The Husband’s valuation was based on an average of the estimated value of a similar property on 3 different real estate websites, realtor.com, redfin and Zillow. The Wife did not provide any documents in support of her estimated valuation, thus I accept the Husband’s estimated valuation. It is not disputed that the outstanding mortgage loan as at 10 June 2024 was USD341,551.51.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Both parties agreed that the matrimonial home should be sold within one year. The dispute is over the percentage of division of the matrimonial home. Each party claims that they are entitled to 69% of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Downpayment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is not disputed that the payment of USD147,859.08 towards the downpayment for the matrimonial home was paid from the Wife’s bank account sometime in September 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The main dispute is over each party’s contribution towards this payment. The Husband claimed that he paid USD97,000 towards the downpayment while the Wife paid only USD63,609.08<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> she paid USD74,609.08 towards the downpayment, and that the Husband only contributed USD89,000 towards the downpayment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s case was that his contribution of USD97,000 was made up of the following: (i) an undisputed loan of USD80,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> from his father; (ii) “reimbursements” of USD12,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> in total, paid to the Wife in 7 separate bank transfers from September to November 2019; and (iii) a cheque of USD5,000 to the Wife dated 5 October 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The Wife claimed however that two of the “reimbursements” made in September 2019, totalling USD4,000, were for home renovation and not for the downpayment as they were labelled as such. The Husband’s explanation was that he had done so<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> because parties had been advised by their mortgage brokers that banks did not like seeing funds for downpayment accumulated from too many different sources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife’s calculations that she paid $74,609.08 for the downpayment were based on a table<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that she compiled by simply deducting the Husband’s payments to her from the total downpayment sum. She did not provide any supporting documentation of her payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As the Husband’s payments of USD97,000 were all supported by documentary evidence, I accepted the Husband’s version that he paid this sum towards the downpayment. At the time the Husband transferred the disputed monies to the Wife in September 2019, the mortgage loan had just been disbursed and parties had not undertaken any renovations, as such I accepted that the full payment of USD97,000 made by the Husband went towards the downpayment of the property. It is irrelevant whether the disputed sum of USD4,000 was paid towards renovations or the downpayment, because in either case, the sum would still count towards the Husband’s direct contributions to the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The exact downpayment figure paid by both parties varied between USD155,000 and USD163,609.08. The sum of USD155,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> appeared to be based on what parties had initially budgeted for when they planned the purchase of the matrimonial home. In any event, the Husband accepted that the Wife’s direct contribution towards the downpayment was at least USD63,609.08 so I accepted this figure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mortgage loan repayments</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Both parties accepted that the total mortgage loan repayments amounted to USD100,835.35<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The dispute was over how much each party contributed towards this sum. The Wife at first claimed that she had paid $20,248.68<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> towards the mortgage loan repayments, but then changed this figure to $30,822.11<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. The Husband submitted that he had made 100% of the mortgage loan repayments, in accordance with parties’ agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> that he would do so while the Wife would pay for the Homeowners Association fees, property tax and insurance for the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     It is not disputed that the mortgage loan was paid out of parties’ joint Bank of America account number 3251-0993-xxxx (“the Joint Account”), and both parties had deposited monies into the Joint Account. The Wife claimed that she transferred monies from her personal account to the Joint Account, but did not provide a clear explanation of how she arrived at either the sum of $20,24.68 or $30,822.11 for her share of the mortgage payments. Instead, she provided only a tabulation of transfers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> she claimed to have made from her personal account to the Joint Account, totalling USD104,619 over a period of a few years. At the hearing on 4 July 2025, the Wife’s counsel then submitted that half of the sum of USD30,000 paid towards the mortgage from the Joint Account, being USD15,000, should be attributed to the Wife’s direct contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the Wife’s transfers to the Joint Account were payments for her vehicle loan, vehicle insurance, as well as payments for her other expenses, including the Homeowners Association fees, all of which were paid from the Joint Account as well. After deducting these payments, there was “little to no excess”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> for the mortgage payments from her. The Husband pointed out that in 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, the Wife transferred a total of USD12,090 to the Joint Account and out of this amount, USD10,302.16 went towards payment of the Wife’s vehicle loan, USD404.16 to payment of her vehicle insurance, USD2,022.64 towards 3 payments to the Homeowners Association, and USD600 was transferred back to the Wife’s personal account. In short, the Wife withdrew more funds for her personal payments than what she had transferred to the Joint Account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     While the Wife claimed she had made a total of USD104,619 in transfers to the Joint Account, this was from the period of June 2018 to August 2021 and the mortgage loan was only disbursed in September 2019. The Husband had calculated that from September 2019 onwards, the Wife’s transfers to the Joint Account totalled only USD63,045<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I was satisfied that the Wife’s total withdrawals for her vehicle-related payments, Homeowners Association payments and other personal expenses also exceeded her deposits for the year 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     However, I note that in 2021, the Wife started transferring larger sums of money to the Joint Account, and her total deposits in 2021 alone amounted to USD49,300. The Wife’s withdrawals from the Joint Account that year totalled USD45,308.26<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, leaving a balance of USD3,991.74 which could have been applied towards the mortgage payments. In the circumstances, I accepted the sum of USD3,991.74 to be the Wife’s direct contribution towards the mortgage payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Renovations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife claimed that she had paid USD42,026.86<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> towards home renovations whereas the Husband’s case was that she had only spent USD18,599.87<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> for renovations and furniture. In May 2020, there were repairs and renovations done to the matrimonial home due to flood damage. Unfortunately, the Wife did not explain or itemise the renovations she had personally paid for, and provided only a tabulation of payments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> she had allegedly made towards renovation costs for the period September 2019 to August 2020. The Wife also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> she had purchased USD38,858.51 worth of household appliances, furnishings and decorations, which should be attributed towards her <em>indirect</em> contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband submitted that most of the repairs and renovations due to the flood damage was paid for by parties’ home insurance. The charges from the Homeowners Association for mitigation of damages and reconstruction of damaged portions were paid for by insurance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. Parties also received cheques from their insurance company totalling USD10,419.46<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, which were deposited into the Wife’s account, which was used to partially offset the cost of USD16,800 for the renovation of the bathroom. As for the remainder of the bathroom renovations not paid for by insurance, amounting to about USD6,380.54, I attributed this to each party equally. The Husband also accepted that the Wife had paid USD1,829.26 and USD1,457 towards the renovation and cabinets, thus I added these sums to her contribution towards the renovations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, the Wife’s tabulation of payments supposedly made for renovations consisted of what looked like purchases from (or payments to) household or furniture stores such as The Home Depot, Crate and Barrel and Ikea; and included items like door lock, wall outlets and strip lights. This accorded with the Wife’s claim that she had actually purchased most of the household appliances, furnishings and decorations, which would count towards her indirect financial contributions towards the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Does payment of home insurance or property tax count towards direct or indirect financial contributions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband included the payments towards the Homeowners Association fees, home insurance and property tax as part of the parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The Wife did not include such payments as part of parties’ direct contributions but as part of their indirect financial contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Much ink was spilled on parties’ dispute over how much each had paid towards the Homeowners Association fees and property tax for the matrimonial home. The Wife claimed that she paid a total of USD42,501.84<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> towards the Homeowners Association fees, while the Husband claimed she only paid USD41,195.04 towards the same as the Wife’s deposits into the Joint Account for August to October 2020 were insufficient to pay for the same<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. The Wife submitted that she had paid USD9,464.72 towards property tax for the property and the Husband submitted he had paid USD29,311.75 towards the same<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. However, the Wife claimed that the Husband’s payments for property tax in February 2020, November 2020 and February 2021 should not be counted as his contributions because he had also paid his credit card bills from the Joint Account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is trite law that the direct financial contributions towards a matrimonial property include monies applied towards the acquisition of the property as well as monies which go toward the “<em>improvement</em>” of the property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. Payments for household outgoings, such as payments for home insurance, management fees and property tax are more appropriately considered expenses which are necessary for the maintenance of the matrimonial property, instead of expenses for the acquisition or improvement of the property. As such, I did not include the payments of the Homeowners Association fees, home insurance and property tax in the calculation of parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home. They will be taken into account when considering parties’ <em>indirect</em> financial contributions subsequently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"34%\"><col width=\"33%\"><col width=\"33%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s contribution (USD)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s contribution (USD)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Downpayment</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$63,609.08</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$97,000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mortgage Loan Repayments</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$3,991.74</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$96,843.61</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Renovations</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$6,476.53</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$3,190.27</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total Contribution</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$74,077.35</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$197,033.88</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><u>Percentage contribution to the Matrimonial Home</u></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>27.3%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>72.7%</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Division ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For the purposes of division, both parties agreed that the structured approach adopted <em>in ANJ v.

The application of this approach involves<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> (i) obtaining the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other as a ratio (“the first ratio”); (ii) obtaining the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other as a ratio (“the second ratio”); and (iii) taking an average of the two ratios which represent the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Wife submitted that her indirect contributions were at least 70%<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> for the purposes of division. The Husband submitted that the marriage was so short that any indirect contributions should be disregarded<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>, effectively, that <em>only</em> parties’ direct contributions should be taken into account in the division of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The law on division of matrimonial assets in short and childless marriages is traditionally that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> division would be in accordance with parties’ direct financial contributions only, as non-financial contributions would usually be “<em>minimal</em>” in such cases. In <em>WGW v. WGX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29293-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 5</a>, the marriage was a short and childless one of about three and a half years. The court found that the parties there “<em>did not go through with the customary traditions of marriage</em>”, it was disputed at length whether the parties had even lived together, and thus the court gave “<em>no weight</em>” to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In <em>WUI v. WUJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31716-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 25</a>, however, the High Court highlighted the risk<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> of using labels of “short”, “moderate” or “long” to categorise marriages and allowing such labels to take precedence over assessing the actual facts of the case. While it was pointed out that this did not change the legal position that “<em>indirect contributions would in many cases be minimal, if not irrelevant, when it comes to “short marriages”</em>”, the court’s view was that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> it was only in clear-cut cases where the marriage “<em>was effectively of a de minimis duration</em>”, that <em>zero</em> weight should be ascribed to the parties’ indirect contributions. It was also clarified that where a marriage is so short that indirect contributions are “<em>of little to no importance</em>”, these are usually cases where the <em>effective</em> length of the marriage is less than three years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It cannot be gainsaid that while it is essential to look to case precedents when applying established legal principles, the facts of each particular case are always different and it is particularly important in matrimonial proceedings not to simply apply a “one-size-fits-all” approach. The facts of the present case are rather unique. Even though parties acknowledged that the period of cohabitation was very short, and they started living separately after only nine months of marriage, they nevertheless went on to purchase the matrimonial home together in September 2019, <b>almost a year after</b> their separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is not disputed that parties then proceeded to continue with their financial obligations towards the matrimonial home, both depositing monies into, and having the household outgoings paid through, the Joint Account until sometime in October 2022. The Husband conceded that the marriage had definitely broken down by around October 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>, when he sent the Wife a text message to discuss divorce. It is also not disputed that after the purchase of the matrimonial home, the parties did work together with regard to the renovations and repairs of the matrimonial home after the flood in 2020, and each took care of various payments for the household outgoings. The Wife also concedes that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> her claim for indirect contribution mainly consists of indirect <em>financial</em> contribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In <em>TYY v. TYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20095-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 6</a>, the High Court had taken into account parties’ indirect contributions in the division of assets, even after the parties started staying in separate bedrooms under one roof. While the marriage in <em>TYY v. TYZ</em> was a much longer one than in the present case, the court found that the marriage still existed “<em>in a meaningful sense</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> despite parties’ separation, as the actions of parties in relation to the assets where they worked together to make renovations to the matrimonial home, rent out the created rooms and used the rental monies for the benefit of their children, was during the subsistence of the marriage. As such, the court found that such indirect contributions could be taken into account in the division of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The ultimate overarching objective of the division of matrimonial assets is to ensure that each party’s contribution towards the marriage, both direct and indirect, is duly recognised such that the outcome leads to a just and equitable division<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. Based on the particular facts of this case, I find that notwithstanding that parties lived separately after only 9 months of marriage, they both contributed indirectly in terms of the outgoing expenses of the matrimonial home and also worked together on the renovations and repairs to <em>improve</em> the matrimonial home. In the circumstances, I would attribute the indirect contributions equally between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Accordingly, the overall ratio would be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.92%\"><col width=\"32.2%\"><col width=\"33.88%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Direct</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">27.3%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">72.7%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Indirect</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">50%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">50%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Division ratio (with rounding)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">39%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">61%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjustment of final ratio of division and “uplift”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife had argued that the weightage should be 70:30<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> in favour of direct contributions, due to the short marriage. She also submitted that the Husband had undisclosed assets, had enjoyed “sole occupation of the matrimonial home”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> since June 2023, and an uplift of 6% should therefore be applied to increase the final ratio of division in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In <em>USB v. USA and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24645-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 57</a>, the Court of Appeal affirmed the application of the <em>ANJ v. ANK</em> structured approach to short marriages. The court also stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> one of the key characteristics of the structured approach was that it gave the discretion to set the weightage in terms of the relative importance of the direct and indirect contributions. This was “<em>especially useful</em>” in short marriages. It was also reiterated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> while the court may have a discretion to adjust the weightage of direct and indirect contributions in a short marriage, the court is not compelled to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The ultimate goal of the court, in an exercise of determining the final division ratio for matrimonial assets, is to achieve a <em>just and equitable</em> division between parties under s112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”). As stated above, this was an unusually short marriage and the parties had only cohabited for about nine months before living separately. Even by the Wife’s own submission, the “<em>actual duration of marriage was only 2 years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></em>”. There were no children to the marriage and parties largely kept their lives and finances separate, apart from the outgoings for the matrimonial home. In the circumstances, I found that the direct contributions should be given greater weight and that a weightage of 70:30 in favour of direct contributions was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I did not however agree with the Wife’s submission that she should be given any “uplift” as the other matrimonial assets were no longer in dispute, each party had agreed to retain their respective assets in their names and any “non-disclosure” of assets was irrelevant. Given the above, the final division ratio between the parties is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>Wife</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[(27.3/100) x 70] + [(50/100) x 30] = 19.11 + 15 = <b>34.1</b> (rounded up)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>Husband</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[(72.7/100) x 70] + [(50/100) x 30] = 50.89 + 15 = <b>65.9</b> (rounded up)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance and sums claimed by the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Wife sought an order for the Husband to pay her monthly maintenance of USD1,500. In addition to this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to pay her (i) the sum of USD88,741.30, being her tuition/university fees incurred; and (ii) the sum of USD40,903.15 being her legal fees. The Wife claimed that this was based on the Husband’s agreement to pay for her tuition/university fees if the Wife’s parents disowned her upon finding out about the marriage, and the Husband’s promise to pay for her legal fees in the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     It is trite law that the overarching principle for awarding an ex-wife maintenance is “<em>financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. This must however be applied in a manner that takes into account the “<em>new realities</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> flowing from the breakdown of a marriage. It is also clear that the ex-wife is not entitled to expect a full subsidy for her lifestyle and must <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>“<em>exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and to sustain her pre-breakdown lifestyle</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Nominal maintenance for an ex-wife is also not awarded “automatically” or as a matter of course; and when assessing the appropriate quantum of spousal maintenance to be ordered<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>, the courts will take into account the share of matrimonial assets awarded to the ex-wife. The relevant factors to be taken into account, when awarding maintenance for an ex-wife, are listed in s114 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As stated above, the parties’ pre-nup agreement also stated that in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, neither party would seek “<em>any form of alimony or support</em>” from the other party. The relevant clauses are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<b><em>8. SUPPORT</em></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Each of the parties has income from individual property interests sufficient to provide for his or her respective support… Therefore, in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, it is agreed and understood that neither party shall seek or obtain any form of alimony or support from the other.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>10. MUTUAL WAIVER OF RIGHT TO RECEIVE SPOUSAL SUPPORT.</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Accordingly, should either party file an action for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, or should there be a judgment for dissolution of marriage or legal separation between the parties by a court of competent jurisdiction, [Wife’s name] waives and shall be forever barred from asserting a claim for spousal support, regardless of the circumstances then existing, including pendente lite spousal support, against [Husband’s name]. The parties knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily waive their rights to spousal support. No court shall have jurisdiction to order spousal support to either party under any circumstances.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Given the express terms of the pre-nup agreement, I found it extremely surprising that the Wife maintained her claim for spousal maintenance in the proceedings. While the Charter appears to be silent on prenuptial agreements relating to maintenance, the court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> took the view that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> all prenuptial agreements relating to the maintenance of the wife would also be subject to the overall scrutiny of the court and if the terms of such an agreement were just and fair, the court could endorse such terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Even without the pre-nup agreement, it was not disputed that the parties kept their finances separate during the short marriage or that the Husband did not support the Wife financially during the marriage. By the Wife’s own admission, after she claimed that her parents stopped supporting her during the marriage, she paid for her own expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> using her credit facilities, savings, stock investments and reselling her luxury bags.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> since she graduated from university in 2020, she was not able to find any work and currently relies on her stock investments and savings to pay for her monthly expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>, which come up to USD3,162.75. The Wife is very young, only 29 years old, and has a university degree. While she claimed that she is now trying to find a job in marketing, she has not provided any evidence of her efforts to find employment. The Wife herself has conceded that she has been able to support herself financially even without employment, and she has an earning capacity. Based on all the circumstances of the case and the extremely short marriage, I find it appropriate to order no maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Claim for the Husband to pay for the Wife’s university fees </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> her parents had found out about parties’ marriage around 2018 and had disowned her. She also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> she then borrowed USD250,000 from her aunt and used the money to pay for her university fees. The Wife relied on the supplemental agreement to support her claim that the Husband should pay her for the university fees incurred by her. The relevant clause in the supplemental agreement is as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>In the event that Ms T’s parents found out about her marriage to Mr H, and stopped paying for her college tuition, Mr H hereby warrants that he will provide financial support to cover Ms T’s college tuition and reasonable rent for the remaining of Ms T’s college studies. Ms T shall provide Mr H the billing statement from the college she attends at the beginning of each semester.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Husband submitted that the Wife had not met any of the conditions in the supplemental agreement in order to claim that he should reimburse her for her university fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I have briefly dealt with the legal effect of foreign pre-nuptial agreements regarding the division of matrimonial assets in Singapore above. The supplemental agreement was technically not a pre-nuptial agreement as it was signed by parties shortly after marriage, and the Wife herself agrees that this should be regarded as a <em>postnuptial</em> agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Sections 116 and 119 of the Charter deal with agreements for maintenance. As stated by the court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></em>, all postnuptial agreements with respect to maintenance are subject to the scrutiny of the court and the courts have the <em>statutory</em> power to override or vary any postnuptial agreement with respect to maintenance if the circumstances so warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     While the Wife sought to rely on the supplemental agreement as a postnuptial agreement dealing with maintenance, it was not in my view such an agreement. The court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> highlighted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> there were two kinds of postnuptial settlements, separation and pre-divorce settlements where parties decided on what happens upon their separation or divorce, as the case may be. The relevant clause in the settlement agreement, however, seemed to be phrased to cover an event occurring <em>for the duration of the Wife’s university studies</em>, and not upon the parties’ divorce or separation. The preamble of the supplemental agreement provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>WHEREAS, Ms T is a sophomore in college, and her parents are paying for her college tuition; Ms T is afraid that her parents might stop paying for her college tuition if they found out about the marriage;</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>WHEREAS, Ms T desires to have and Mr H is willing to provide financial support </em> <b><em>during the course of Ms T’s college studies</em></b> <em>;” [emphasis added by me]</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The above preamble and words of the relevant clause: “<em>In the event that Ms T’s parents…stopped paying for her college tuition, Mr H ..will provide financial support to cover Ms T’s college tuition and reasonable rent </em><b><em>for the remaining of Ms T’s college studies”</em></b> and “<em>Ms T </em><b><em>shall provide</em></b><em>… the billing statement from the college she attends </em><b><em>at the beginning of each semester</em></b>” all suggested that the Husband’s obligation to provide the finances to cover the Wife’s university fees would be in the course of the Wife’s university studies. Indeed, if the Wife’s parents had stopped paying for her university studies and the Husband had not fulfilled his obligation, the Wife would not have been able to complete her studies and upon divorce, some three or four years later, this would not be a relevant point of contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     There was no contemporaneous evidence to show that the Wife’s parents had found out about the parties’ marriage while she was still enrolled in university and had “disowned” her or cut her off financially. The Wife exhibited an email to her aunt<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>, dated 16 April 2023/2024, “acknowledging” the aunt’s financial assistance for her “educational and living expenses”. After the Husband adduced evidence of messages from 2019 to 2023 showing that he and the Wife had a cordial relationship with her mother and family members, the Wife then acknowledged that she and the Husband had regular communications with her mother and family members after the marriage. However, the Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> such interactions were merely those of “courtesy and respect” and did not indicate that she received any financial support from her parents. More importantly, the Wife did not dispute that she had gone to visit her family in 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>, after parties’ marriage. Neither the Wife’s aunt nor her parents filed any affidavit in support of her claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In any event, even if the settlement agreement was meant to apply to events post-divorce, I am of the view that the Wife has not managed to make out the condition precedents required for the Husband’s obligation to take effect. In order for the Husband to be required to pay for the Wife’s university fees, the Wife has to first prove that her parents found out about her marriage <em>and</em> stopped paying for her university fees. As stated above, the Wife has not managed to prove this. On the contrary, the evidence suggested that the Wife’s mother did not object to the parties’ marriage and was close enough to the Husband to text him directly to ask him to join them for dinner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>. Further, it is not in dispute that the Wife did not provide the Husband with her university billing statement <em>at the beginning of each semester</em>, and that she only furnished her university invoices in the course of these divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As such, I dismiss the Wife’s claim for the Husband to reimburse her the sum of USD88,741.30 for her tuition/university fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Was there an agreement for the Husband to pay for the Wife’s legal fees in these proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Wife also submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> prior to commencing divorce proceedings, the Husband had promised to pay for her legal fees and she sought an order for him to pay the sum of USD40,903.15. While the Husband did not deny this, he responded that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> he had agreed to pay the legal fees only if the divorce was uncontested. The Husband also submitted that this offer was made at a time when parties were attempting to reach an amicable resolution on the divorce and ancillary matters. The only evidence of such an agreement by the Husband is a text message dated 26 August stating<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> “<em>Oh yes, include the lawyer fee in the category. My bad for missing it out.</em>” While there was no date affixed to the message, it is not disputed that the message was sent prior to the commencement of divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Based on the above, I do not find that there was a binding agreement by the Husband to pay for the Wife’s legal fees in these divorce proceedings. Parties should be free to negotiate and state their position when attempting amicable resolution and this should be encouraged. If, in the course of negotiations before proceedings are filed, parties are bound to their proposals notwithstanding that negotiations subsequently fail and proceedings become contested, there would be no meaningful attempts at resolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In any event, the award of costs lies in the discretion of the court. Parties may file their submissions on costs within 14 days of this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Finally, it is my view that the Wife has taken an extremely unreasonable position in the ancillary matters. This was undoubtedly a short marriage with no children, and parties had also signed a pre-nuptial agreement prior to the marriage. Yet despite having the benefit of legal advice, the Wife chose to renege on the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement and insisted on her claims that parties’ assets be subject to division and that the Husband reimburse her for her university fees and pay her monthly wife maintenance. As a result, parties filed no less than 3 ancillary affidavits each and went through one Summons application for discovery, only for the Wife to abandon her claim for division of parties’ other assets at the final hearing.

The CA said that the objective of section 69 applications was to provide the Wife with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help her overcome her immediate financial needs having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors listed in s.69(4), which also takes into account the earning capacity of the Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The “immediate financial needs” approach was adopted because section 69 applications are not final maintenance applications as this comes after the divorce case, if a divorce is applied for, is finalised. In the present case, the Court noted that on paper, this marriage lasted about 34 years before the Complainant filed a Writ of Divorce in <b>D 846/2024</b> on 26 February 2024. Even if the Respondent’s case that the Parties had lived separate lives since 2008 was the date used, <b>this marriage lasted at least 18 years</b> (from the date of marriage on 24 December 1990 to 2008).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5        <b>The 3 key issues</b>: Therefore, in the Court’s view, for an IM application under s69 of the Women’s Charter, there were 3 key issues to be decided: (i) what was the Complainant’s reasonable monthly maintenance as a monetary sum (ii) whether there was neglect or refusal by the Respondent to provide such reasonable maintenance and (iii) the financial capacity of the Respondent to pay such reasonable monthly maintenance. In this regard, the Court was guided by 2 further cases for the Complainant’s IM application in <b>MSS 422 of 2024</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       These were the cases of <b><em>VXM v VXN <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26761-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 37</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong held that [at paragraph 13] “I would add that at this interim stage, the Court does not have the full means to make a thorough investigation of the Parties’ financial matters or their lifestyles, which it will have to examine thoroughly at the AM stage.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The second was the case of <b><em>WBU v WBT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a></em></b> whereby the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong also noted [at paragraph 10] that it was observed in the case of <b><em>UEB v UEC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a></em></b> at paragraph 13, that one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Hence, the Court dealt with both Parties’ positions on the <b>estimated expenses</b> of the Complainant based on her request for $8,000 per month as IM. The Court’s final assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses of the Complainant was as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"11.46%\"><col width=\"24.84%\"><col width=\"23.98%\"><col width=\"20.36%\"><col width=\"19.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>ITEM</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mortgage Loan</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cash: $1,022</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CC: Agree that it was first paid from the joint account until March 2024.

Therefore, it was the Respondent’s statutory duty to pay her reasonable monthly maintenance until the divorce case was completed. The Court noted that it was not disputed that the Respondent did not pay the Complainant anything after she left the company. <b>Hence, the Court was of the view that there was neglect or refusal by the Respondent to provide reasonable maintenance to the Complainant after January 2024.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <b>On the final issue of the financial capacity of the Respondent to pay reasonable monthly maintenance</b>. The Court noted that the Respondent’s Counsel submitted that the Respondent’s current income was around $9,000 per month but averaged out to be at $6,823.64 with the Complainant’s average income for the past 4 years at $7,112.50 which was more than the Respondent’s. However, this did not take into account the fact that the Respondent’s total monthly expenses were given by the Respondent himself in his AOM at $22,000 per month, which begs the question of how he could afford this on his average salary of $6,800 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It also did not take into account the fact that while the Respondent was currently earning an income, the Complainant was now unemployed at 55 years old. However, the Court was also guided by the case of <b><em>WGJ v WGI <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29413-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 11</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck reasoned [in paragraph 34 of the case] that the Husband’s unemployment was by choice and that the Husband’s failed attempts at seeking employment did not mean that he had a reduced earning capacity. Hence, for the present case, the Complainant’s earning capacity was still relevant in determining her own share for her maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On a balance of all these factors, the Court was of the view that the Complainant’s request for interim monthly maintenance payable in the sum of $8,000 for herself was not warranted. However, the Court was of the view that the Respondent should pay the sum of $2,000 to the Complainant as interim monthly maintenance until the determination of the divorce case. This should be backdated to 1st February 2024 due to the Respondent’s refusal/neglect to pay the Complainant any maintenance after she left the company and lost her salary, which was her only source of income. Therefore, the final sum owing as of today’s date was $34,000 (being 17 months from 1st February 2024 to 1st June 2025 inclusive) and thereafter at $2,000 per month until the determination of the divorce case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Accordingly, <b>MO 256/2025</b> was issued dated 3 June 2025.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary Matters – Division of matrimonial assets – Maintenance – Access"],"date":"2025-08-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 5365 of 2023","title":"XQH v XQI","citation":"[2025] SGFC 85","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33671-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Chew Wei En (Zhou Wei'En) (Teoh & Co LLC) for the plaintiff","Ms Remya Aravamuthan (High Street Chambers) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-08-18T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Janice Chia","html":"<root><head><title>XQH v XQI</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQH <em>v</em> XQI </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33671-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 85</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 5365 of 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">07 August 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Janice Chia </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Mr Chew Wei En (Zhou Wei'En) (Teoh &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiff; Ms Remya Aravamuthan (High Street Chambers) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XQH — XQI </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Access</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">7 August 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Janice Chia:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff (Husband) (“PH”) and the Defendant (Wife) (“DW”) registered their marriage on xx November 2014.

flat”). The PH submits that the value should be $980,000 while the DW submits that the value should be $910,888. The PH relies on the highest transacted price of $970,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> in June 2024 for a flat on a similar floor. I find the PH’s value to be unrealistically high given that even in 2024, there were similar flats at a similar floor which sold at a much lower price of $910,888 (see transaction in July 2024)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. There is also no reason why the matrimonial flat should be valued higher than the highest transacted price of $970,000. A more realistic value would be to take the average price of $910,888 and $970,000, which would work out to $940,444.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Inclusion of PH’s luxury watches (S/No. 9 and 10 of Table 1)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In relation to the PH’s luxury watches, the PH does not dispute the DW’s values which are based on the purchase price of the watches. However, PH takes the position that the watches should be excluded from the matrimonial pool<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. The PH argues that both parties should retain their respective luxury items. His position is that the DW has failed to make full disclosure of all luxury items in her possession. He also takes the view that the values are de minimis (amounting to a mere 3% of the assets). The DW disagrees and submits that both parties’ luxury items should be included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I do not accept the PH’s submission to exclude both parties’ luxury items from the matrimonial pool. First, I disagree with PH that items with values amounting to 3% of the asset pool are considered de minimis. The value of both parties’ disclosed luxury items exceeds $50,000, which would hardly be considered de minimis in an asset pool of $1.2 million. Second, the PH’s contention that there is non-disclosure on the DW’s part is unsubstantiated. Even if the PH is to prove that there is non-disclosure, the appropriate remedy is to draw an adverse inference against the DW rather than to exclude what are clearly matrimonial assets from the pool. Finally and more importantly, both parties accept that the luxury items were purchased during the course of the marriage. In other words, the items were purchased using matrimonial funds. It would therefore follow that the luxury items should be included in the matrimonial pool for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Inclusion of 50% of the DW’s Bank of China fixed deposit account (S/No. 19 of Table 1)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The DW had a fixed deposit account (ending with 3504) in the Bank of China (“FD account”) in her sole name at the time of IJ. The balance as at the date of IJ was $100,000. However, as of the date of the Ancillary hearing, the FD account was no longer in the DW’s name. The DW admits that she transferred the full sum of $102,902 to her mother when the fixed deposit matured in November 2024. The DW’s mother subsequently placed the same monies in another fixed deposit account (also in the Bank of China) in her own name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ respective positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The PH submits that 50% of the monies in the FD account to be matrimonial asset since the DW concedes that the monies in the FD account partially came from the monies in a bank account which was then jointly held by the DW and her mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The DW takes the position that 100% of the monies in the FD account belong to her mother and was rightfully returned to the mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The DW submits that the PH bears the burden of proof to establish that the monies in the FD account were matrimonial assets. She further submits that the PH has failed to prove that he contributed to the funds in the FD account and accordingly, the FD account should be excluded from the matrimonial pool<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the PH argues that the onus is on the DW to prove that the FD account which is in the DW’s name should be excluded from division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I agree with the PH’s submission that the DW bears the evidentiary burden of proof. PH refers to the Court of Appeal’s case of <em>USB v UBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“USB”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>, which states in [31]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“When a marriage is dissolved, in general all the parties’ assets will be treated as matrimonial assets unless a party is able to prove that any particular asset ……. is [therefore] not a matrimonial asset. The party who asserts that an asset is not a matrimonial asset or that only a part of its value should be included in the pool bears the burden of proving this on the balance of probabilities.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Although <em>USB</em> involves different issues (pre-marital assets which continue to be financed using matrimonial monies), the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in relation to the burden of proof where a party asserts that a personal asset is not a matrimonial asset is directly applicable in the present case. As of IJ date, the FD account was in the DW’s sole name. Following the case of <em>USB</em>, the bank account would be considered a matrimonial asset unless the DW proves that the monies did not belong to her. The question of whether PH has contributed the monies is not relevant at the stage of determining if the FD account is a matrimonial asset. The PH’s contribution to the FD account is only relevant if the monies are considered matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The DW’s submissions on the evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The source of funds for the FD account is explained by the DW in her own affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, and subsequently by the DW’s mother (“DM”) first in a signed statement (“DM’s statement”) exhibited in DAM-2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> and subsequently in DM’s 2 affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. The explanations differ slightly and these differences are detailed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The DW in her DAM-1<sup>39</sup> explains that the monies in the FD account came from a UOB account which was jointly held by the DW and the DM (“joint UOB account”), without mention of any other sources of funds. On the other hand, in DM’s statement, the DM mentions that the DW’s BOC monies came from a combination of the joint UOB account and the DM’s own FD monies (“DM’s FD”) which was also held in BOC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. In the subsequent DM-1, the DM claims that only $3,000 came from the joint UOB account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In the same affidavit, the DM explains that the FD account was opened in the DW’s sole name so that the DW could take advantage of the preferential rates for online transactions and cites her unfamiliarity with online banking as the reason<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. The DM does not provide the reasons for her instructions to close the FD account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Examining the evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The DW produces a letter from UOB which shows that the joint UOB account was closed on 16 February 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. The evidence shows that the FD account was opened on 16 February 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> which coincided with the closing of the joint UOB account. I therefore accept the DW’s submission that the monies in the UOB were likely transferred to the FD account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     However, there is no evidence of the closing balance of the joint UOB account and therefore no evidence of the amount transferred to the FD account. According to the DW, UOB could not provide the closing balance as the account was a passbook account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     At the same time, there is also no evidence that the DM had transferred monies from DM’s FD to the FD account. The DM merely provides an account balance sheet which shows DM’s past deposits with the Bank of China<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> under DM’s sole name. However, the DM does not explain or provide evidence of the flow of funds from DM’s FD to the FD account. In short, neither the DW nor the DM is able to prove that the funds in the FD account mostly came from the DM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     At the same time, I find the DW’s use of the FD account to be inconsistent with her claim that the FD account was held on trust for DM. The DW’s first mention of the FD account is in DAM-1 when she explains that the monies were used to fund her (DW’s) legal fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. This statement suggests that the DW, in fact, had liberal access to the funds in the FD account. Additionally, it is rather unusual to utilise a fixed deposit account for a loan since the funds in a fixed deposit account is not readily available or accessible unless one is prepared to forgo all interest which will only accrue on maturity. In contrast, savings accounts offer high liquidity. It is also noted that the DM herself has substantial funds in her personal savings accounts. As it turns out, the DW did not utilise any of the monies in the FD account and the full amount with interests was “returned” to the DM on xx November 2024 about 4 months after the IJ when the FD matured.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given the above analysis, I am of the view that the DW has not proven on a balance of probability that the FD account solely belongs to the DM. As the DW has conceded that the FD account included the monies from the joint UOB account without evidence as to exact amount, the FD account is considered jointly contributed by the DW and the DM. In this regard, I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that half of the balance in the FD account should be included in the pool for division. However, given that the bank account balances should be valued as at IJ date, the value of the FD account at the material time will exclude the interest component (which is only earned upon maturity). Accordingly, $50,000 (being 50% of the principal sum of $100,000) is returned to the pool for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ liabilities </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The PH’s liabilities are set out in Table 2a.

In the present case, the DW concedes that the loans were solely used to fund her litigation costs in the present proceedings. In other words, the DW’s personal loans are not incurred for the family and do not fall within the ambit of section 112(2)(b). The same conclusion is reached by applying the principles in <em>AQT v AQU</em> which states at [37]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“It was highly unusual for the legal fees for these very matrimonial proceedings to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets.

Subsequently, the Volkswagen was traded in for another car (a 7-seater Nissan) which was again traded in for a Mercedes Benz (with license plate no. SNMxxxxT) (the “Mercedes”). The Mercedes forms part of the matrimonial pool (item 8 in Table 1). The DW does not seem to dispute that the PH uses the cars for the benefit of the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The DW claims that she had given the PH a loan of $13,000 for the downpayment when the Volkswagen<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> was purchased. According to the DW, the loan remains unpaid as of the ancillary hearing. The DW seeks the return of the loan of $13,000. In the alternative, she asks that the sum of $13,000 be considered her direct contributions to the Mercedes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On the other hand, the PH claims that the monies used to purchase the Volkswagen came from the parties’ joint account.

There is no documentary evidence of the alleged loan. While I accept that given parties’ spousal relationship, the absence of a written agreement is not conclusive, there is also no evidence of the DW taking steps to recover the alleged loan. This is despite the passage of time (since 2020) and the fact that the same vehicle has since been sold and replaced with 2 other vehicles. Given the lack of evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, I am not convinced that parties had intended the sum of $13,000 to be a loan from the DW to the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In any event, a claim for the return of an inter-spousal loan should be disregarded for the purposes of a s112 Women’s Charter division. First, a division under s112 of the Charter is not the appropriate forum to determine what is in essence a civil claim (see case of <em>AZZ v BAA</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>). Second, an inter-spousal loan does not change the size of the matrimonial pool for division, unlike a loan to a third party. The High Court case of <em>UYP v UYQ</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> explains:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Under the regime in s 112 of the Women’s Charter, the assets of both parties acquired during marriage are pooled together as “matrimonial assets”. Thus the source of the loans, if acquired by one party to the marriage, would have been [matrimonial assets]. An inter-spousal loan would not result in a change in the size of the overall [matrimonial asset] pool, because the loan moneys would merely be transferred from one party to the other.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As the sum of $13,000 is not to be considered as a loan to be returned to DW, the question arises as to how this sum should be treated under the s112 of the Charter. The DW argues that the sum of $13,000 should be considered as her direct contributions towards the Mercedes. On the other hand, the PH argues that the expended sum should be taken as the DW’s indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I prefer the PH’s position as there is no evidence showing how the injection of $13,000 to the Volkswagen translates to her direct contribution first to the Nissan (following the trade-in of the Volkswagen) and subsequently to the Mercedes. Given such limitations, the PH’s position that the sum of $13,000 should be considered as indirect contribution is reasonable. This follows the approach taken in the case of <em>UZK v UZL</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ direct financial contributions to the matrimonial flat </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I next move on to the parties’ respective direct contributions to the flat, being the only substantive jointly held asset between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The parties collected the keys to the matrimonial flat sometime in 2016 and started living there in May 2018. Both parties agree that the costs of renovations and fittings (“renovation costs”) was around $45,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. However, both parties claim that they had contributed the lion share towards the renovation costs although neither party is able to submit the supporting evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I shall first examine the PH’s position, which appears to be both unclear and ambiguous. On one hand, the PH admits that the parties shared the renovation costs, furniture and electric appliances<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>. At the same time, the PH also asserts in the same affidavit that he paid for the lion share of the parties joint account, from which the renovation costs were paid<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. In respect of the parties’ financial arrangements during the period when the renovation costs were expended, the PH provided the following explanation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>a)     The parties lived at the DW’s mother’s flat after marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>b)     The PH passed all his income (including bonuses) to the DW during that period and only took an allowance for his daily expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>c)     At the DW’s request, the PH deposited his salaries into the joint account between the DW and her mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     According to the PH, the above arrangement (“initial financial arrangement”) continued until parties came to a subsequent agreement to each contribute $800 to the parties’ joint account (conveniently referred to as the “joint contribution arrangement”). Consequentially, the PH, in his written submissions, suggests that he should be credited with 2/3 of the renovation costs<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The PH also argues that the DW has more savings despite earning less than the PH, which would suggest that the DW has saved a large part of her income. The PH points out that the DW has admitted to saving 15% of her income<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the PH has contributed more than the DW towards the joint account which was in turn used to finance the family’s expenses (including the renovation costs)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>. For convenience, I refer to this argument as the “income-savings ratio argument”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     On the DW’s part, she disputes the PH’s account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> specifically (a) that the PH’s entire income and bonus was given to DW (b) that the PH credited his income into the DW’s joint account with her mother. The DW maintains that she has financed a large part of the family’s expenses (including the renovation costs) using her personal bank account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>. She argues that she contributed $25,000 from her personal bank account towards the renovations. She does not directly address the income-savings ratio argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As mentioned above, there is no evidence to prove either party’s version, both in respect of the source of funds and their versions of the initial financial arrangement. I further note that the PH maintained rather contradictory claims as to how he, on one hand, handed over the entire salary (save for a small allowance) to the DW and yet at the same time deposited his salary into the DW’s and the mother’s joint account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am also not persuaded by the PH’s income-savings ratio argument. Although the evidence shows that the DW has more savings despite a lower income, this fact alone does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the DW had contributed less towards the joint account or family expenses. First, the PH’s argument is premised on the assumption that both parties had equal savings when the parties registered their marriage. Given the PH’s own admission that the DW started work before he did (and therefore had more CPF in her account)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>, this assumption may not necessarily be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Second, the PH’s submission overlooks several crucial factors that influence accumulated savings beyond income and respective contributions to family expenses. These factors include the parties’ saving and spending patterns, as well as their distinct approaches to investment. In the present case, the DW and PH do not seem to share similar spending and saving patterns. The DW candidly admits that she has a habit of saving 15% of her income. She explains that her voluntary CPF top-ups serve as a means to reduce her tax liabilities. Additionally, DW has a habit of investing her monies as seen from her Central Depository Private Limited (“CDP”) portfolio. In contrast, the PH does not have own any shares or have any shares account. At the same time, the PH does not seem to have a similar mindset regarding savings. According to DW, she had in the past advised the PH to adopt the practice of making voluntary CPF top-ups to reap the same tax reliefs but the PH “does not listen”. The parties’ personal assets similarly reflect the parties’ different approaches towards savings and investments, with insurance policies and shares comprising more than half of the DW’s personal assets. On the other hand, the PH’s personal assets are mostly made up of luxury watches. Given the foregoing, I am not persuaded by the income-savings ratio argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As there is no evidence of the parties’ contributions towards the renovation costs, I had applied the broad-brush approach to divide the renovation costs equally between both parties. In arriving at this conclusion, I have given significant weight to the joint contribution arrangement which the parties had during the marriage. Although the renovation expenses were incurred prior to the arrangement, the fact that parties agreed on equal contribution (despite the difference in their incomes) suggests that the parties’ contributions prior to the arrangement were not far from that proportion. In the absence of contrary evidence, it is more reasonable to split the renovation costs equally between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Accordingly, the parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial pool are set out in Table 3 below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 3</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"38.7877575515103%\"><col width=\"30.2860572114423%\"><col width=\"30.9261852370474%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PH ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DW ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF (principal) paid towards the flat</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">183,936.36</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">146,942.64</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Renovations of $45,000</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">½ of 45,000 = 22,500</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">½ of 45,000 = 22,500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Parties’ personal assets in their sole names </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">306,582.09</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">336,845.50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Less: liabilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(68,003.61)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">238,578.48</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">336,845.50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Parties’ respective direct financial contributions </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">445,014.84 (46.8%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">506,288.14 (53.2%)</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect contributions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This is a 10-year marriage with 2 children. The PH submits that he should be awarded 50% as his indirect contributions. According to the PH, he paid for the majority of the family’s expenses. Additionally, he did most of the household chores, took charge of the renovations and organised family celebrations and holidays. Finally, he was also heavily involved in caring for the children and was a hands-on father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On the other hand, the DW submits that she should be awarded 95% as her indirect contributions. She has always been the children’s primary caregiver and has had to sacrifice her career progression due to the family. She has contributed financially by paying for the children’s expenses and contributed to the joint account. After the marriage broke down in April 2023, she has had to engage a domestic helper at her own expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     First, I deal with indirect financial contribution. As the parties’ contributions evolved with the change in the family’s living arrangements, I have considered the parties’ financial contribution in 3 distinct timeframes. For the first 3 years after marriage (until sometime in 2017/2018), the parties lived together at the DW’s mother’s flat. The 1<sup>st</sup> child was born during this period. In respect of this period, the parties’ respective positions largely mirror their submissions in respect of their contributions towards the renovation costs. Additionally, during the same period, a monthly allowance of $1,000 was paid to the DW’s mother. Both parties claim to be the one who paid the allowance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> but neither party provided evidence. I adopt the same approach as that of the renovation costs and consider the parties’ indirect financial contribution during this period to be equal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Subsequently, the parties moved to the matrimonial flat and resided there until the marriage broke down sometime in April 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> when the PH left the matrimonial flat. The 2<sup>nd</sup> child was born during this period. For this period which lasted about 5 years, it is undisputed that the parties largely followed the joint contribution arrangement which entailed both parties contributing equally towards the joint account. It is undisputed that the joint account monies were used to pay for (a) children’s school fees (b) outgoings for the flat such as utilities and (c) miscellaneous expenses like food or clothing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. The parties’ dispute pertains to the expenses which were not paid out of the joint account. The disputed expenses include groceries, eating out, children’s insurance and holidays<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>, general household maintenance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> and family celebrations and activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> pregnancy-related expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>, car-related expenses and PH’s credit card bills. Both parties agree that the DW paid for the children’s enrichment programmes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The PH’s position on the disputed expenses can be summarised as follows: (a) he contributed jointly<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>, and in some cases he contributed jointly because the monies came from the joint accounts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> (b) he paid for the majority of the expenses because he earned more<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the DW claims that (a) she paid for all expenses from her personal account (b) the joint contribution was insufficient to cover the excluded expenses. To support her claim, the DW tenders evidence to show payment of insurance policies, groceries, school-related expenses, albeit the evidence relates to payments only between 2023 and 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For this part of the marriage, I find that the DW’s financial contributions to be marginally higher than the PH’s. The evidence suggests that the DW is the one who managed the family’s finances as part of her role of running the household. The DW mentions that she was responsible for (a) paying the household bills<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> (b) paying for the household items and groceries purchased either online or using the FairPrice account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> (c) paying for the children’s school and enrichment expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> (d) paying for the PH’s car-related expenses and credit card bills<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>. In the PAM-2, the PH does not disagree that the DW made the payments but claims that the funds came from the parties’ joint account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span>. In this regard, I note that the PH’s later claim that the joint account was used for the excluded expenses contradicts his initial position which expressly states that the joint contribution arrangement was intended to cover limited expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_89\" id=\"Ftn_89_1\"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Even if PH’s subsequent position is to be accepted, ie. that the joint account monies were also used to cover the excluded expenses, it is not his case that he contributed more than $800 to the <em>joint</em> account regularly. Instead, the PH makes a general assertion that “During the marriage … the Defendant would request for me to pay for my share (or the entire sum) of the expenses. I would do so without hesitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>” However, the PH’s assertion lacks essential details, such as the mode of payments, their frequency, and their intended purpose. In contrast, the DW consistently maintains that she pays for all the expenses from her personal account and the joint account is insufficient to pay for the family’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_91\" id=\"Ftn_91_1\"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span>. Based on the evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the DW likely supplemented the family’s expenses with her own funds. Given that the excluded expenses are substantial, I find that the DW’s indirect financial contributions during this period were marginally higher than those of the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I next consider the parties’ contributions for the period from April 2023 when the DW locked the PH out of the matrimonial home after she discovered his alleged infidelity. It is also undisputed that the DW collected monthly rental of $1,000 for 1 year but did not give the PH his share of the rental proceeds. The PH argues that the Court should take into consideration the fact that the DW had enjoyed exclusive occupation of the flat since April 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_92\" id=\"Ftn_92_1\"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     On the other hand, the DW submits that the PH’s monthly contribution of $800 became irregular after PH moved out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_93\" id=\"Ftn_93_1\"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>. In addition, she incurred further expenses when she had to engage a domestic helper in November 2023. Between April and November 2023, she enlisted the help of the PH’s mother to pick up one of the children when she could not manage to pick up both children on time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_94\" id=\"Ftn_94_1\"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>. The arrangement stopped when she was served with the divorce documents in November 2023. As a result, she had to shoulder the costs of the domestic helper on top of her share of the family’s expenses. To support her claims, the DW submits proof of payment for the domestic helper, the children’s expenses, the children’s insurance premiums and miscellaneous expenses such as clothing and necessities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_95\" id=\"Ftn_95_1\"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I accept the PH’s submission that the DW’s exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and his share of the rental proceeds (which is $6,000) should be considered in the PH’s favour when determining his indirect contributions. I am further of the view that the PH had, for the most part, continued to pay his monthly contribution of $800 although the payments were not always paid in a timely manner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_96\" id=\"Ftn_96_1\"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>. The evidence further indicates that his monthly contributions increased to $1,000 in or around July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that the family’s expenses increased when the DW engaged a domestic helper. I also accept that the expense is necessary given the children’s ages (7 and 4 years old) and the fact that the DW works full time. In addition, the DW has had to continue paying for the excluded expenses in the same way as she did prior to the breakdown of the marriage. It is unlikely that the PH’s share of the rental proceeds (an additional sum of $500) would be sufficient to cover the increased expenses. For these reasons, I am of the view that the DW’s contribution during this period is still slightly higher than the PH’s even after taking the PH’s share of the rental proceeds and the DW’s exclusive use of the matrimonial property. Taking into consideration the above matters, including the $13,000 contribution towards the family car, I consider the DW’s overall indirect financial contributions to be marginally higher than the PH’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect non-financial contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     As for the parties’ non-financial contributions, both parties claim to have done most of the housework, such as cleaning, washing and laundry, as well as marketing / grocery shopping. The PH submits that he had to do most of the housework because he had very high standards of cleanliness<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_97\" id=\"Ftn_97_1\"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the DW contends that she managed the household chores despite of the PH’s standards<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_98\" id=\"Ftn_98_1\"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The DW further submits that she is a supportive wife to the PH. Besides updating his resumes, she also handles his financial matters such as settling his bills. Additionally, she takes on the full responsibility of running the household which frees the PH to attend to his work and social commitments. In contrast, the PH claims that he contributes during the DW’s extended family gatherings and brought the DW’s mother for overseas trips.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In relation to the childcaring duties, the DW submits that she is the primary caregiver for the children, and manages the children’s daily routines, schooling matters, organises family activities and celebrations. The PH similarly claims to be a hands-on father who was involved in the feeding, changing, bathing and sleep duties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_99\" id=\"Ftn_99_1\"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>. He also claims that he would prepare breakfast for the children, fetch the children to and from school, and bring them for outdoor activities, outings, playdates and enrichment. The DW contends that the PH’s claims are exaggerated and his involvement in the children’s daily lives was sporadic at best.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     First, I consider the parties’ indirect non-financial contributions during the period immediately after the marriage when the parties lived together with the DW’s mother. It is undisputed that during this period, the parties received substantial assistance and support from the DW’s mother. Although the PH claims to have assisted in the household chores, his contributions are likely to have been less regular given, considering that he worked 12-hour shifts (which will be elaborated upon below) and the parties were living at the DW’s mother house. In all likelihood, the DW’s mother who was not working did the bulk of the household chores.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In terms of the childcaring duties, the DW’s mother played a key role in caring for the 1<sup>st</sup> child as both parties worked. However, it is reasonable to conclude that both parties would have been responsible for childcare during nights and weekends when they were not at work. I find that the DW’s indirect contributions outweigh that of the PH in this aspect. Although the PH claims to be a hands-on father, he would be hampered by his working hours. For the most part of the marriage, the PH worked in the oil industry and had to take on shift work. From the evidence, each shift lasts for 12 hours at a stretch and generally alternates between morning and night shifts. Given the PH’s working hours, it is reasonable to expect the DW to take on brunt of the childcaring duties at night or during the weekends when the PH is away at work. Caring for an infant or a young toddler, unlike household chores, is a 24-by-7 job which requires the constant presence of the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I next consider the parties’ roles during the period when they were living at the matrimonial home. I accept that the PH likely focused on the household chores as he had higher standards of cleanliness. On the other hand, the DW is likely to have devoted her attention and energies to caring for the toddler and the infant. Additionally, she took charge of the children’s schooling and education arrangements, which the PH does not dispute. At the same time, I accept that both parties undertook other responsibilities when necessary, albeit to a lesser degree. In general, I am of the view that the DW’s contributions during this period continue to outweigh the PH as she had to care for the children’s daily needs after her working hours when the PH was at work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Lastly, for the period from April 2023, I agree with the DW that her indirect non-financial contributions will far outweigh that of the PH’s. After the PH left the matrimonial home, the DW single-handedly took charge of the household chores and cared for the children. While the PH may be correct in that the DW brought about this situation when she evicted the PH from the matrimonial home, the fact remains that the DW did take on the responsibility of running the household during this period without additional help until December 2023 when the present proceedings started.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In conclusion, I find that the DW’s overall contributions outweigh the PH’s for the reasons above. Additionally, I note that the DW has had to prioritise the family’s needs over her work commitments partially due to the PH’s work schedule and the lack of reliable support which can be activated at short notice. In my view, the appropriate ratio for the parties’ indirect contribution is 65:35 in favour of the DW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overall contribution ratio </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The parties’ direct and indirect contribution ratios are given equal weight in this case. Neither party submitted otherwise and I find no reason to assign different weightage. Accordingly, the overall division is in table 4 below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 4</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"

paragraph 1, the net value of the HDB flat at [Property 1] (the “Flat”) is to be divided 41% to the Plaintiff and 59% to the Defendant. The net value is the market price of the flat less the outstanding loan and costs and expenses of the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_C\"></a>C.     The Flat at [Property 1] is to be sold in the open market within 7 months from the date of this Order if the Defendant does not exercise the option in paragraph 4 below, and the sale proceeds shall be utilised to repay the outstanding housing loan, deduct costs and expenses of sale before dividing 41% to the Plaintiff and 59% to the Defendant. Each party is to refund his / her CPF monies utilised for the purchase of the Flat including accrued interest from his / her share of the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_D\"></a>D.     The Defendant shall have the first option to take over the Plaintiff’s share of the Flat, which shall be exercised within 1 month from the date of this Order. In the event that the Defendant exercises the option, the Plaintiff’s share, title and interest in the Flat shall be transferred to the Defendant, other than by way of sale, within 4 months from the date of this Order upon the Defendant paying the Plaintiff his 41% share in the net value of the Flat. The Plaintiff shall refund his CPF monies utilised for the purchase of the Flat, including accrued interest, from the consideration he receives. In the case of a transfer, the Defendant shall bear the costs and expenses of the transfer of the Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_E\"></a>E.     Each party is to retain assets in their own names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ incomes </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The PH submits that his gross income is $7,881 monthly, which is calculated based on his 2024 income tax statement. However, he seeks to persuade the Court that a significant part of his earned income comes from overtime and shift work which is non-guaranteed. He highlights that his basic pay is in fact lower than the DW’s<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_100\" id=\"Ftn_100_1\"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>. It is undisputed that the DW’s income $5,200<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_101\" id=\"Ftn_101_1\"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I am not persuaded by the PH’s submission that his income should be assessed based on his basic pay rather than his total income. With the exception of 2023, the PH’s income tax statements between 2021 and 2024 show a steady increase in his income of more than $10,000 per year. As for 2023, the PH earned $20,000 more as compared to 2022. The PH explains that his company has a turnaround event every 4 years during which the employees are expected to take on more shift work. Accordingly, the PH’s income for the turnaround years will be higher than usual<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_102\" id=\"Ftn_102_1\"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>. Even if I disregard PH’s income earned in the turnaround year, I am of the view that the PH draws a steady income in the other years regardless of the variable components in his pay. Therefore, I am unable to accept the PH’s submission that his income is in fact lower than the DW’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Accordingly, the parties’ incomes are assessed based on their 2024 income tax statements. To be clear, 2024 is not a turnaround year for the PH. The DW’s income excludes rent as there is no evidence that the tenancy agreement was extended beyond May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_103\" id=\"Ftn_103_1\"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 6</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.75324935013%\"><col width=\"33.1133773245351%\"><col width=\"33.1333733253349%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PH ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DW ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Gross</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">7,881<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_104\" id=\"Ftn_104_1\"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,466<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_105\" id=\"Ftn_105_1\"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Nett (less employee CPF of 20%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,305</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5173</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">55%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">45%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The DW seeks monthly maintenance of $1,500<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_106\" id=\"Ftn_106_1\"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> which she submits is necessary to meet her reasonable expenses. She asks that the maintenance be paid in a lump sum from the PH’s share of the matrimonial flat. The PH’s position is that the DW is not entitled to maintenance as her income is sufficient to cover her reasonable expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_107\" id=\"Ftn_107_1\"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Applying the law to the facts</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The case of <em>ATE v ATD</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_108\" id=\"Ftn_108_1\"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> establishes that the power to order spousal maintenance under section 113 Women’s Charter is supplementary to the division of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The facts presented in this case do not substantiate the DW’s claim for spousal maintenance. First, the parties’ marriage is not considered a long marriage as the parties were married for just under 10 years. The DW is also a working mother, who remained gainfully employed throughout marriage. She claims that she had to put her career on a back burner to focus on her family. In this regard, her sacrifice has been considered as part of her contributions towards the family in the division of the matrimonial assets. The DW is relatively young and has many more productive years ahead as a career woman. Although she has made career sacrifices for her family, her income, being only marginally lower than the PH’s, indicates that her skillset remains marketable and relevant in the job market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     Furthermore, the DW will receive cash of over $200,000 from the sale of the matrimonial property in addition to keeping her personal assets. I am of the view that she will have sufficient financial resources to maintain herself. Lastly, I agree with the PH that the DW’s income is sufficient to pay for her own personal expenses.

id=\"\"></a> <u>Monthly allowance for DW’s mother</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I have excluded DW’s monthly allowance for her mother. From the mother’s bank statements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_111\" id=\"Ftn_111_1\"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>, her mother has savings of at least over $300,000 in her bank accounts and will be able to support herself without assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s personal savings</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I have excluded the personal savings of $800. I accept that the DW has a habit of saving a fair portion of her monies. However, the PH should not be required to pay maintenance calculated based on expenses which include the savings component. To award maintenance on this basis will indirectly result in the PH contributing to the DW’s personal savings after the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s insurance premiums</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The PH submits that the DW’s insurance premiums should be excluded from her monthly expenses as the DW’s insurance policies have an investment or savings component. I agree with the PH’s position in this regard. The DW’s insurance expense per month is $630. This adds up to $7,560 per year. From the list of the insurance policies, most of the policies have a significant surrender value. Similar to savings, insurance policies which have a savings or investment component should be disregarded from the DW’s expense list. At the same time, I note that the DW has insurance policies which do not seem to have an investment or savings component, eg. HSBC Life Shield Plan B/Enhanced Care and Singlife CareShield standard<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_112\" id=\"Ftn_112_1\"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span>. As there is insufficient evidence as to the premiums payable for the policies without an investment or savings component, I adopt the PH’s own insurance expense (ie. $158) given that the PH has found the same amount to be a reasonable expense for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Helper-related expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The PH’s position is that the sum of $1,000 is sufficient to cover all expenses related to the domestic helper, including the levy, medical bills and living expenses. The DW’s claim is $1,250. I am of the view that $1,200 is a reasonable sum and includes the renewal or replacement fees for a domestic helper which is generally incurred after the end of the 2-year employment contract. From the DW’s documents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_113\" id=\"Ftn_113_1\"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span>, the charges for engaging a helper is in the region of $2,300 which works out as a monthly average of $100 over 24 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Total household expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     As stated in the table, certain expenses are categorised as household expenses and split equally between the DW and the children. The total household expenses come up to 1,877. This works out to be $626 per person per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance for children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The PH’s position is that each party should bear the children’s reasonable expenses equally. According to the PH, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses are $1,266 and $1,245. He proposes to pay $1,250 for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The DW’s claim is for PH to pay maintenance of $1,200 for each child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_114\" id=\"Ftn_114_1\"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>. She submits that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_115\" id=\"Ftn_115_1\"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> are $1,923 and $1,277 respectively but without the children’s share of the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Apportionment of the parties’ contributions</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The PH argues that the parties should bear the children’s reasonable expenses equally. The PH finds support for his position in the High Court case of <em>TBC v TBD</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_116\" id=\"Ftn_116_1\"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span>. Briefly, the Court in the case of <em>TBC</em> ordered the parties to contribute equally towards the child’s expenses despite the significant difference between the parties’ incomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     On the other hand, although not explicitly mentioned, the DW seems to take the position that the PH should pay a larger proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses as seen from her claims vis-à-vis the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The case of <em>TBC</em> predates <em>ANJ v ANK</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> in which the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court. The lower court in <em>ANJ</em> had ordered the parties to pay the children’s expenses along similar proportions with their respective incomes. Additionally, I would highlight the High Court case of <em>TIT v TIU</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> which distinguishes the case of <em>TBC</em>. Of key importance is the Honourable Judge’s pronouncement in [63]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“The prevailing standard of s68 (and s69) of the Charter must be </em> <em><u>the </u></em> <em>reasonableness </em> <em><u>having regard to all the circumstances of the case</u></em> <em>, and the best interests of the children. In accordance with the Court of Appeals’ approach in ANJ v ANK, the financial capabilities of the parents must be a valid consideration. In this context, both the parties in TBC v TBD … </em> <em><u>were well able to afford </u></em> <em>the orders for equal contribution.” [emphasis mine]</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In other words, there is no default position whereby both parties are to bear the financial burden equally. In this regard, I would respectfully disagree with the PH’s reliance on the case of <em>TBC</em> which mentions in [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“Each parent stands in the same parent-child relationship with the child or children and each parent has the duty to maintain the child or children. Against that backdrop, the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Instead, I am guided by the principle that “equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means”, which was endorsed in the case of <em>TIT</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span>. It follows therefore that each case will turn on the facts and all factors relevant to the determination of the parties’ financial means must be considered without any factor being given predominant weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     Returning to the present case, the PH has not explained why the parties’ financial capabilities would support his position of equal contribution. As mentioned above, based on the PH’s income in regular years, the PH earns about 20% more than the DW. Once every 4 years when the turnaround event happens, the PH’s income increases by 10%<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> over and above the usual increment he receives. Although the DW will receive about $200,000 more than the PH after the division of assets, the DW will have to find suitable accommodations for herself and the 2 children within reasonable distance from their school. The children will also spend most of their time with the DW. In contrast, while the PH will similarly require a place to live, his choice of accommodation is not constrained by the distance nor the size. Given these reasons, it is reasonable to assume that the DW’s financial burden will be heavier than that of the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     Additionally, both children’s monthly expenses are in the region of $3,000 (excluding expenses to be paid on a reimbursement basis) and represents a significant portion of the DW’s income which is just under $5,200. The facts of this case differs from the case of <em>TBC</em> in which the Court held that the mother could afford to bear 50% of the child’s expenses, ie. $720 out of her income of $5,200. As I have found DW’s reasonable expenses to be around $2,200, I accept that the DW will not have the financial means to contribute equally to the children’s total reasonable expenses. The PH has also not provided reasons otherwise. It is not his position that he is unable to afford his share of the children’s expenses. In any event, based on his income and reasonable monthly expenses (ascertained to be around $3,400 in <u>Annex 1</u>), I believe he has the means to pay his share of the children’s reasonable expenses, as determined by the parties’ income ratio. I am further of the view that the PH should look to reduce his car expenses which constitutes 70% of his monthly expenses. Accordingly, I order PH to bear 55% of the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Children’s reasonable expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     After reviewing the evidence, I determine the 1<sup>st</sup> child’s reasonable expenses to be $1,464 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses to be $1,434. Both figures exclude certain expenses which are to be paid on a reimbursement basis according to the parties’ respective contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     As mentioned above, the PH is to bear 55% of the children’s reasonable expenses. Accordingly, excluding the expenses which are to be reimbursed, the PH is to pay monthly maintenance of $805 for the 1<sup>st</sup> child and $790 for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Tables 8 and 9 below set out the parties’ positions and my findings on the children’s expenses.

The DW has submitted evidence to show that the 1<sup>st</sup> child takes swimming lessons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_127\" id=\"Ftn_127_1\"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> which averages around $100 per month and skating lessons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_128\" id=\"Ftn_128_1\"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> which costs $70 per lesson weekly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The PH disagrees that he should pay for the child’s enrichment expense as his prior consent was not sought. The DW contends that she had always planned the children’s enrichment classes and the PH had never been involved. I disagree that the PH’s consent is necessary given that he has admitted that he left the DW to take care of the children’s “education matters and their learning progress”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_129\" id=\"Ftn_129_1\"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> which, in my view, encompasses related matters such as enrichment classes. The 1<sup>st</sup> child is presently 8 years old and it is not unreasonable for the child to have some form of enrichment. The PH is to bear 55% of the enrichment fees on a reimbursement basis subject to a cap of $400. The cap is based on the child’s historical expenses and can be incurred without the PH’s prior consent. The PH’s prior consent will be required only if the monthly enrichment fees exceed the cap of $400 provided the PH is expected to contribute towards the additional expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Enrichment expense for the 2nd child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The DW claims a sum of $150 as enrichment expenses for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child.

However, there is insufficient evidence on the precise premiums payable for policies which do not have an investment component. I have ordered the PH to bear 55% of the insurance premiums on a reimbursement basis up to the DW’s claimed amount of $115.33.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Entertainment and holiday expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     The PH submits that this expense should not form part of the DW’s claim and each party should pay for the children’s expenses respectively. On the PH’s part, he claims that he spends a total of $200<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_131\" id=\"Ftn_131_1\"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> per month on the children for their entertainment although it is undisputed that he only has ad hoc access to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    I allow a sum of $100 per child for the combined item of entertainment and holiday expenses. There is evidence to show that outings are part of the children’s common routine<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_132\" id=\"Ftn_132_1\"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span>. Additionally, the DW has also brought the children on short overseas trips in the past<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_133\" id=\"Ftn_133_1\"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span>. This amount is reasonable given that the children spend the majority of their time with the DW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s request for children maintenance to be paid in a lump sum from the PH’s share of the sale proceeds</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I have not allowed the DW’s claim for the children’s maintenance to be paid in a lump sum. The DW’s reasons for lump sum maintenance are that (a) the PH is likely to default in the payment of maintenance (b) the DW will have to incur legal costs to enforce the maintenance arrears (c) the upfront lump sum maintenance will allow the DW to retain the flat to provide the children with a stable environment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    First, there is no evidence that the PH is likely to default on the maintenance payments. There has been no court order for maintenance. The DW had also not taken out any application for maintenance. Additionally, it is undisputed that the PH did contribute towards the joint account in the past before and after the marriage broke down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    The DW also contends that the PH is financially irresponsible as he has credit card debts. However, the relevant question is whether the PH is likely to default on the maintenance payments rather than the PH’s management of his finances. In the present case, the PH’s credit card debts of over $5,000 is not considered excessive to the extent that the PH will be incapable of fulfilling his financial obligations. Therefore, I do not accept that the PH is likely to default on his maintenance obligations. I am also not persuaded by the DW’s further argument that she should not have to incur legal costs to pursue enforcement actions. If enforcement action is necessary in future, the DW can claim costs if she is successful in the enforcement action. The possibility that legal costs may be incurred in future enforcement proceedings, which may or may not be necessary, cannot be the basis upon which the court will order maintenance to be paid in a lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    I next turn to the DW’s submission that the lump sum payment will allow her to retain the flat which will be in the best interests of the children. I accept that, in all likelihood, the DW will not be able to buy over the PH’s share in the flat given the present value of the property and her income. However, those reasons alone are not sufficient for the Court to order the PH to pay maintenance in a lump sum. It is trite law that the Court must, in awarding lump sum maintenance, consider the paying party’s financial resources and ability to pay maintenance in a lump sum. In the present case, the PH does not have significant savings of his own. The bulk of his assets will come from his CPF monies and the cash proceeds from the sale. With these monies, the PH will similarly have to find his own accommodations. I am of the view that PH will not have the ability and resources to pay all future maintenance in a lump sum and such an order will cripple the PH financially.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I touch briefly on the DW’s additional submission that retaining the current matrimonial flat is in the children’s interests, which would justify her claim for lump sum maintenance. The DW explained that uprooting the children from the present living environment will disrupt their living and schooling arrangements. I accept that, in all likelihood, the children will have a longer commute to and from school. It also goes without saying that the children will have to adapt to a new living environment. Nonetheless, any impact to the children can be mitigated by the constant presence of the primary caregiver. Accordingly, I am of the view that retaining a flat which the DW will struggle to finance, may not necessarily be in the children’s best interests. For the above reasons, I dismissed the DW’s prayer for the children maintenance to be paid in a lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders on maintenance for wife and children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    In conclusion, the orders for maintenance are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_A\"></a>A.     There shall be no maintenance for the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B\"></a>B.     The Father shall pay maintenance for the children as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B-p3_i\"></a>i.       Monthly maintenance in the sum of $850 for the 1<sup>st</sup> child and $790 for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child, which shall commence on 5 May 2025, and subsequently on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B-p3_ii\"></a>ii.       55% of the following expenses on a reimbursement basis : (i) school fees for both children (ii) enrichment fees for the 1<sup>st</sup> child capped at $400 per month (iii) insurance premiums capped $115.33 per month per child for both children. The PH shall make payment of the expenses within 14 days from the date on which the DW provides the invoices to the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_C\"></a>C.     All maintenance payments are to be made to xx bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    The parties agree that there shall be joint custody of both children, with care and control to the DW. The parties however disagree on the PH’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s access </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The PH seeks regular overnight and unsupervised access to the children. The PH points out that he has a close relationship with the children. He alleges that the DW has restricted his access to the children since the breakdown in the marriage. Although there was an informal access arrangement in place after the PH moved out of the matrimonial home in which he gave prior notice to the DW to exercise access, the informal arrangement did not work well as the DW has, at times, deprived him of access or demanded that his access be supervised. In one instance, the DW turned aggressive as captured in a video footage submitted by the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    On the other hand, the DW contends that she is “open to a progressive access regime beginning with supervised sessions and, subject to positive outcomes and demonstrated parental responsibility, leading to increased flexibility.” She proposes that there should be a review at “an appropriate milestone”, either determined by the children’s ages or as recommended by a family specialist<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_134\" id=\"Ftn_134_1\"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span>. The DW submits that supervised access is in the best interests of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_135\" id=\"Ftn_135_1\"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> for various reasons. First, the children are young and unable to express their independent preferences on access. Second, the PH has persistently failed to give adequate notice of his intention to exercise access. Third, the PH has not shown that he is capable of prioritising the children’s needs. Fourth, the PH may introduce his romantic partners to the children which would confuse the children. In response to the PH’s video footage, she explains that she had intervened when she noticed the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s distress and accuses the PH of displaying confrontational behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    At the onset, it is necessary to reiterate that the Court must focus on the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration in the making of any child-related orders pursuant to section 125 of the Women’s Charter. It is also widely accepted that, save for exceptional circumstances, the best interest of a child is best served by ensuring the continuing involvement of both parents in the child’s life. In respect of the types of access orders which will promote a child’s welfare, the High Court case of <em>APE v APF</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_136\" id=\"Ftn_136_1\"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> in [32] makes clear that unsupervised access should be awarded unless there are exceptional circumstances present. The Honourable Judge in <em>APE</em> mentioned three exceptional circumstances which may warrant supervised access, first where there are serious welfare concerns due to violence or inappropriate parenting, second where the parent-child relationship is estranged to the extent where serious repair is required, third where the parents’ relationship is acrimonious to the extent that the unsupervised access cannot be effectively implemented. The same principles are endorsed in the later High Court case of <em>WZF v WZG</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_137\" id=\"Ftn_137_1\"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> and is in line with the pronouncement in <em>WQT v WQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30967-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 3</a> in which the Honourable Judge commented in [5]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“Supervised access is a necessity and not an order to be made as a precaution when there are no indications that it is needed.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>None of DW’s reasons for seeking supervised access satisfy the criteria of exceptional circumstances mentioned in <em>APE</em>. The DW claims that the children are young and unsupervised access is unsuitable. The young age of a child does not immediately preclude the access parent from having unsupervised access. The key point is the child’s inability to communicate and the access parent’s unfamiliarity with the child, rather than the child’s young age per se. In the present case, neither of the children who are 5 and 8 respectively are considered too young to vocalise their needs as and when required. At the same time, it is not the case that the Father has been consistently absent from their lives and he would need time to resume his relationship with the children. Instead, the DW’s contention seems to be that the children should be allowed to decide if, how and when they wish to spend time with their father, and the children are too young to indicate their preference. In my view, this is not the reason to order supervised access. Although the Father has had somewhat irregular access since the marriage broke down, the children are not unfamiliar with him to the extent that the Father and children require therapeutic interventions to resume contact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    As for the DW’s claim that the Father has not proven himself to be a parent who prioritises the children’s needs, I find this contention to be lacking in concrete examples and evidence. It is unclear how the Father has failed to prioritise the children’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    I do, however, accept the DW’s contention that the PH does not give sufficient notice of his intention to exercise access, and cancels or change agreed plans at short notice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_138\" id=\"Ftn_138_1\"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span>, although this seems to be primarily due to the nature of his shift work. Even if this is the case, the solution is to put in place structured access orders and to impose a minimum notice period when there are changes to the access arrangements, rather than to supervise his access. It is unclear how an order for supervised access will cure the disruption to the children’s daily arrangements arising from last-minute changes. It is also bewildering why the DW prayed for access to remain flexible despite the challenges posed from the same arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    As for the DW’s concern that the PH will bring his romantic partners to access, I am of the view that this fear alone will not justify making an order for supervised access unless there is a real possibility that the PH has regularly exhibited clear disregard of court orders. In fact, there is no evidence that the PH has brought a third party to meet the children during his access although his access has been unsupervised since the breakdown in the marriage. For the above reasons, I agree with the PH that his access to the children should be unsupervised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    As mentioned above, the PH also prays for overnight access to the children from Friday to Saturday if his off-days fall on those days. Additionally, the PH requests that he has access for half of the school holidays and the Chinese New Year public holiday<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_139\" id=\"Ftn_139_1\"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span>. The DW’s position is that there should be no overnight access unless the PH is supervised by his sister and access is in a hotel. The DW’s reasons are that the PH is currently living with his aunt and occupies a small bedroom. There is insufficient space for the children to sleep comfortably. The DW further submits that PH’s overnight access should be supervised as both children are daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    Save for the DW’s concerns regarding the PH’s present living arrangements, I find the DW’s reasons for refusing overnight access to be unjustified. The DW seems to suggest that it is inappropriate for the DW to spend the night alone with the children. However, the DW gives no reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    Nonetheless I am of the view that overnight access is not in the children’s best interests at this stage for different reasons. First, from the evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_140\" id=\"Ftn_140_1\"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span>, the PH’s shift work is likely to pose practical challenges in the making of fixed access arrangements. The PH’s roster works in this way. He has the same off-days on weeks 1 and 3 but does different shifts, ie. night shift in week 1 and day shift in week 3. The same principle applies for weeks 2 and 4. In other words, within a single month, his work schedule differs from week to week and is only repeated every 4 weeks. These changes, although predictable, will pose practical challenges in access arrangements. In short, any structured access arrangement must be planned on a 4-week cycle. From the perspective of the children, the arrangements will change from week to week, which can be admittedly confusing and disorientating particularly for the 1<sup>st</sup> child who also has regular enrichment classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    In addition, the PH’s schedule may be subject to change at short notice as he may be activated to cover absent colleagues who are on sick leave<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_141\" id=\"Ftn_141_1\"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span>. While the PH’s work commitments may be the reason for the last-minute changes, it does not detract from the fact that this makes access arrangements particularly unpredictable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Given the above challenges and bearing in mind that the parties have never worked with a structured access arrangement, I am of the view that it is premature to grant overnight access at this stage. The workability of a structured day access arrangement remains untested. Overnight access arrangements require more planning and coordination ahead of the access and will likely be more disruptive when the access is cancelled or changed at short notice. As for the PH’s request for half of the school holidays and Chinese New Year, the PH has not explained if he is able to take leave for an extended period or specifically during the Chinese New Year holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    Additionally, I agree with the DW that the PH’s present living conditions is not conducive and suitable for both children to have overnight access. The PH occupies a room at his aunt’s house and there does not seem to be sufficient space for the children to be sleeping with the P in the same room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    For these reasons, I am of the view that it is premature for the PH to have overnight access. Given the nature of his job, it is important that the PH first establishes a routine access arrangement with minimal last-minute changes. This will reduce the disruption to the children’s arrangements and build confidence and trust between the parties in their co-parenting journey. The parties are free to agree on overnight access if the opportunity arises. It is also for the same reasons that I dismiss the Father’s prayer for overseas access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    In conclusion, I allow the PH’s prayer for unsupervised access but limited to daytime access. The access arrangement is tailored for the PH’s work schedule.

The Father may have additional access to the children during the Mother’s travel period by giving the Mother 1-week written notice ahead of the Mother’s travel period.

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This case raises two significant issues of public and procedural interest. <em>First</em>, can a person publish on his/her social media platform information and materials relating to ongoing proceedings in the Family Justice Courts? <em>Second</em>, can the person be required to remove such information and materials if they were published <em>before</em> the commencement of the proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Applicant (“<b>Mother</b>”) and Respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) are former spouses. They have two children – a son (born in September 2011) and a daughter (born in October 2014). The marriage was dissolved in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allegations of sexual abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In 2019, the Father was reported to the authorities for allegedly sexually abusing his daughter on two occasions. Police investigated into the matter. He denied the allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Thereafter, the Father posted various messages on Facebook referencing the allegations, including – “Allegations in April 2019 and October 2019”, “CPS had suspended all contact in October 2019”, and “AGC decision still pending???”. These statements appeared on a photograph of him with his smiling daughter (“<b>Post</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>5  In November 2020, the Police informed the Father that no further action would be taken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He subsequently updated the Post to reflect this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Attempts to remove the Relevant Publications</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In 2022/2023, the Mother became aware that the Father had been publishing various information and materials on social media concerning the sexual abuse allegations (“<b>Relevant Publications</b>”). These included statements labelling the allegations as false.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Upon learning of the posts, the Mother sought assistance from SHECARES@SCWO, who facilitate contact with the relevant social media platforms regarding the Relevant Publications.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       While the Father’s accounts were suspended multiple times for violating platform standards, he repeatedly created new accounts and resumed posting similar material.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother lodged police reports against the Father in June 2023, November 2023, and September 2024 concerning the Relevant Publications. According to the Mother, he did not stop or remove them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">SSP 442/2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 11 March 2025, the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order under SSP 442/2025 (“<b>SSP 442</b>”), alleging that the Father had subjected the daughter to sexual, physical, emotional, and psychological abuse from 2019 to 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Further attempts to remove the Relevant Publications</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 14 May 2025, the Mother’s solicitors issued a letter requiring the Father to cease all social media publications that could identify the daughter and that related to SSP 442.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Father did not comply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     A further letter was sent on 11 July 2025 to the Father’s solicitors, warning of the present application. The letter stated that the Mother might reconsider filing the application if he responded satisfactorily to the 14 May letter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He again failed to comply</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 22 July 2025, she filed the present application seeking the following reliefs:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A gag order prohibiting the Father from publishing or broadcasting any information relating to SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     An order directing the Father to delete all such publications and to retract any related communications to third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father objected to the gag order application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As a starting point, the publication of information and materials relating to proceedings in the Family Justice Courts (“<b>family proceedings</b>”) on social media is <em>presumptively inappropriate</em>. There are several reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Confidentiality of family proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <em>First</em>, family proceedings deal with intensely personal matters. Public disclosures risk inflaming conflict, aggravating trauma, and derailing therapeutic processes: <em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29479-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 5 SLR 896</a> (“<b><em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em></b>”) at [20]. This is why Parliament enacted s 10(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“<b>FJA</b>”), which requires family proceedings to be held in private unless the court orders otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The confidentiality extends beyond the life of the proceeding. It has been held that court documents – including affidavits – retain their confidential status and can be protected from disclosure after the family proceeding is over: <em>SRS Life Sciences Pte Ltd and others v Rastogi Mahika Suchet</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30766-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGDC 278</a> at [22] to [25], citing <em>Jethanand Harkishindas Bhojwani v Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27673-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1211</a> at [96].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Protection of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17      <em>Second</em>, confidentiality is of particular importance where a “child” or “young person” is the alleged victim in, or the basis for, a proceeding:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span><em>GCP v GCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24537-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGDC 122</a> at [25]. Section 112(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (“<b>CYPA</b>”) prohibits a person from doing any of the following unless ordered by the court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>a</em>)    publish or broadcast any information relating to any proceedings in any court or on appeal from any court that reveals the name, address or school or that includes any particulars that are calculated to lead to the identification of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or as being a witness therein;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    publish or broadcast any picture as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in any such proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Integrity of judicial process</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18      <em>Third</em>, s 3(1)(b) and s 3(1)(e) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (“<b>AJPA</b>”) prohibits publications and any other acts that pose a real risk of prejudice or interference with pending proceedings. Importantly, liability may attach under s 3(1)(b) even if the person did not intend to cause prejudice or interference: s 3(3) of the AJPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The breadth of these provisions serves to underscore the importance that the law gives to safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process. This is not surprising. Publication of information and materials on social media about an ongoing proceeding can, directly or indirectly, exert undue influence on litigants, their witnesses, the courts. Such publication can also sway public opinion regarding the merits of the evidence and judicial decision in the proceeding – thus undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Gag orders as protective tools</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the above, a person must provide a good explanation as to why it is necessary for him/her to publish on social media information and materials relating to ongoing family proceedings. This burden is especially onerous when the information, material, or proceedings concern a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     If the person fails to provide a good explanation, then he/she may also be potentially liable for contempt of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition, the person may also be subject to a gag order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Where the publication involves a witness to the family proceeding, s 10(4) of the FJA provides that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A Family Justice Court may at any time order that no person is to –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    publish the name, address or photograph of any witness in any matter or proceeding or any part thereof tried or held or to be tried or held before it, or any evidence or any other thing likely to lead to the identification of any such witness;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    do any other act which is likely to lead to the identification of any witness mentioned in paragraph (a);</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Separately, courts retain inherent powers to issue gag orders to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of their judicial process, as well as to protect children’s interests: <em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em> at [19], [20] [23] to [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Courts are not limited to issuing gag orders only after information and materials relating to ongoing family proceedings have been published on social media. The law would be ineffective if courts can only act where the relevant interests have already been compromised. Court can take <em>pre-emptive</em> measures to protect. This is evident, for instance, from the wide language in s 10(4)(a) of the FJA which allows courts to issue a gag order in relation to “any witness in any matter or proceeding ... <em>to be tried</em> ... before it”: see [23] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Along the same principle, I see no good reason why gag orders cannot be issued against information and materials published on social media <em>before</em> the commencement of a family proceeding – if this is necessary to prevent the confidentiality and integrity of family proceedings, and the children’s interests, from being endangered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I shall now apply the above considerations to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father did not dispute that he had published the Relevant Publications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Accordingly, the key issues to be determined as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Relevant Publications can undermine the confidentiality of the proceedings in SSP 442 (“<b>Proceeding</b>”)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether they harm the daughter’s interests by revealing her identity and connecting her to the sexual abuse allegations?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether they pose a risk of prejudicing or interfering with the Proceeding?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Confidentiality of the Proceeding</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the Relevant Publications can undermine the confidentiality of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Relevant Publications make direct reference to the sexual abuse allegations forming the subject matter of SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     They also disclose factual details likely to be aired at trial. These included the daughter’s medical reports which provided information on, among others, (i) the injury allegedly found on the daughter’s private parts, (ii) the date/time/location of the alleged sexual abuse, (iii) the daughter’s account regarding how they had occurred, and (iv) accounts by the Mother and other persons regarding how the alleged abuse came to light. Such information will be relevant in the trial of SSP 442. The trial will commence in about a week’s time (from 13 August 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Father contended that all the publications pre-dated the commencement of SSP 442.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     This is factually inaccurate. At least one YouTube video was posted on 26 March 2025, after the filing of SSP 442. This video contained images of (a) the summons for SSP 442<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and (b) a letter from the Police informing the Father that no further action would be taken against him:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> see [5] above. These clearly disclose the existence of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The fact that the remaining publications pre-dated SSP 442 does not immunise them from a gag order. As explained above, the court may impose gag orders where a publication risks undermining the confidentiality or integrity of an ongoing proceeding. The timing of publication is not determinative. A contrary view will (i) lead to an artificial distinction being drawn between the publications when they contain very similar contents, and (ii) importantly, fail to adequately safeguard the confidentiality of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In my view, the concerns in [30] above (in and of themselves) provide sufficient basis to issue a gag order in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Harm to the daughter’s interests </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I now turn to the next issue – i.e., whether the Relevant Publications reveal the daughter’s identity and connect her to the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, the answer is yes. The daughter is the subject and a witness in SSP 442. As such, her identity must be protected under s 112(1) of the CYPA and s 10(4) of the FJA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father contended that it is unnecessary to remove the Relevant Publications from his social media platforms because they would not disclose the daughter’s identity. He gave three reasons for taking this view. <em>First</em>, he had redacted her name from the publications. (This shows that the Father had recognised that it is against the daughter’s interest for her name to be connected to the relevant materials.) <em>Second</em>, the publications do not contain any recent photo of the daughter’s face – the latest photo was taken some six years ago (in 2019).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span><em>Third</em>, and in any event, his social media accounts did not have many followers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I am unable to agree with the Father. Despite his redactions, persons who view the Relevant Publications can easily piece together from the following information and materials to uncover the daughter’s identity and connect her to the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Relevant Publications were published on the Father’s social media platforms. His name, personal details, and photos with the daughter appear in the profile pages of these platforms.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s <em>full name</em> appears unredacted in several of the published medical reports of the daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In the YouTube posts, a photo of the Father carrying daughter is superimposed on these reports.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The YouTube video published on 26 March 2025 (see [32] above) showed the summons for SSP 442. The summons contained the Father’s full name and his address as the location where the family violence was allegedly committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     These disclosures create a real risk of exposing the daughter to stigma and distress. Removal of the publications is therefore necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Risk of prejudice or interference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Finally, I find that it is also necessary to remove the Relevant Publications because they can potentially prejudice and interfere with the Proceeding. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s posts are public and plainly intended to solicit sympathy and portray the sexual abuse allegations as false. He used emotionally charged language and selectively disclosed materials – e.g., a letter from the Police informing him that no further action will be taken against him (“<b>Letter</b>”) and extracts from affidavits – to show that he had been absolved of these allegations and to support his narrative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the 26 March 2025, the Father had published on YouTube the summons for SSP 442 and the Letter. The dates of these two documents were highlighted. His intention of doing so, when seen in the light of the other Relevant Publications, is clear – to convey to the viewers that the Proceeding is without merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the hearing, the Father informed that the Relevant Publications on his YouTube account were still accessible by the public as at the date of the gag order hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Given the above, if the Relevant Publications continue to be accessible by the public while the Proceeding is ongoing, this can heighten the risk of viewers associating them with the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Furthermore, the Father’s conduct suggests that he may publish more information and materials regarding the sexual abuse allegations – this time in connection with the Proceeding. I say this because of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father has no qualms about turning to social media to discredit the Mother (the person who had filed SSP 442) and to prove his innocence regarding the sexual abuse allegations. He had repeatedly posted such content despite account suspensions and solicitor warnings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Father appeared unapologetic at the hearing and sought to justify his conduct. He had insisted that it was reasonable for him to post the Relevant Publications – claiming that he had made them accessible to the public to reach out to his lost contacts. The Father contended that he would not have done so if the Mother did not cause his social media accounts to be suspended.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had either failed to appreciate – or wilfully ignored – the harm that his publications can harm the daughter’s interests. Even if his intention of making his publications accessible to the public was to reach out to his lost contacts, there is no need for him to publish intimate details, court documents, and the daughter’s medical reports regarding the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     If left unrestrained, the Father may continue publishing information and materials that can undermine the fairness and impartiality of the upcoming trial. Such conduct can interfere with the proceeding in at least two ways: <em>first</em>, by exerting emotional pressure on the Mother and daughter; and <em>second</em>, by shaping the perception of persons (who view his social media) regarding the merits of SSP 442. The Father’s persistence in posting the Relevant Publications – despite multiple suspensions and solicitor’s warnings – reinforces the need for judicial intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore ordered that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father shall remove, and is prohibited from publishing, any content on his social media platforms that is likely to identify the daughter in connection with SSP 442. The Father shall comply with the removal order no later than 6 August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father shall not engage in any conduct prohibited under s 3(1) AJPA, including publishing material that poses a real risk of prejudicing or interfering with SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     During the hearing, I issued the following caution to the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You must refrain from conducting a “trial by public opinion” to vindicate your position or express dissatisfaction with ongoing legal proceedings. The appropriate – and only – forum for resolving legal disputes is the court of law. Persisting in such conduct risks contempt of court, and more importantly, inflicting harm on your daughter’s well-being. The Court will not tolerate such conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For clarity, I make the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I reiterate that the orders I have made are not punitive but protective in nature. They are necessary to safeguard the interests of the parties in SSP 442, the daughter, and the judicial process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in making my orders, I have carefully considered the need to balance the Father’s wish to share information about his life on social media against the overriding need to protect his daughter’s interests and to safeguard the integrity of judicial process. My orders do not preclude him from sharing photos of happy moments with his daughter. What he must refrain from doing is to associate such content with SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, I express no views on the merits of the substantive allegations in SSP 442. My orders pertain solely to procedural and protective considerations. They should not be construed as pre-judging the outcome of the substantive hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Fourth</em>, I note that the Mother had previously obtained a personal protection order (PPO XXX/2020) against the Father in March 2020. She has alleged that he continues to disregard this order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I make no findings on this issue and will leave it to her to pursue the appropriate remedies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     For completeness, I wish to address one other point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father contended that he had been disadvantaged in presenting his case at the gag order hearing by (i) the shortness of time to prepare for the hearing and (ii) a lack of legal representation at the hearing. According to him, if legal aid was granted, his lawyer would need six to eight weeks to be ready to represent him for the gag order application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I am unable to agree that the Father had been disadvantaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Mother’s solicitors had given him ample notice before commencing action the gag order application: see [10] and [11] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, the facts in this case are straightforward and not in dispute – i.e., the Father admitted that he had posted the Relevant Publications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, this case did not involve any complex issues of law. The relevant law had been set out in the Mother’s affidavit dated 22 July 2025 at [30]. The key issue at the gag order hearing is simply this – Should the Father be ordered to remove the Relevant Publications and not to post further publications regarding the sexual abuse allegations and the Proceeding. The considerations for resolving this issue are straightforward – i.e., Is a gag order needed to protect the confidentiality of the Proceeding and the daughter’s interests, as well as to safeguard the integrity of judicial process. The application of these considerations to the present case is straightforward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       During the gag order hearing, the Father had no difficulty presenting his case. His affidavit is clear and shows that he understands the law. For instance, he cited the “hearsay” rule (correctly) to challenge certain aspects of the Mother’s affidavit as being “inadmissible”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He had also sought an “order for costs on an indemnity basis” in his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the Father succeeded in persuading me that an email which he had sent on 18 March 2025 to the Minister of State for Law, Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Family Justice Courts should not be subject to a gag order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)        <em>Finally</em>, the Father’s position that the gag order hearing should only take place in six to eight weeks’ time is clearly untenable. The Proceeding is due to commence in a matter of days. Where concerns have been raised in connection with an imminent trial, they should be resolved expeditiously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I now come to the issue of costs. I am mindful that the Father is receiving legal aid for the conduct of another family proceeding involving the Mother. This did not entitle him to disregard reasonable requests to remove sensitive content. His failure to engage constructively led to unnecessary litigation: see [10] and [11] above. After considering the extent of work involved in preparing for this gag order hearing, I ordered costs at <b>$6,000</b> (all in) against the Father on an indemnity basis.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This is the second time the parties were divorced.

Thereunder, the children would be placed in the care of their mother under the supervision of an approved welfare officer. Further, the children and their mother were to reside at a crisis shelter or the residence of a safe adult. The children and their mother were in favour of the application. The father of the children objected to the application. I granted the CPOs and most of the incidental orders that the Child Protector had sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The father is dissatisfied with these decisions and has filed an appeal against them. I now provide the reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parents married in 2007. The children were respectively 16 and 10 years of age. The family had resided in China up until 2020, when they emigrated to Singapore. The mother remains a citizen of China. The father and the children are citizens of Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The marriage was tempestuous. Barely four years into it, conflicts and violence were occurring between the parents “once or twice a month”. By October 2024, the frequency of these conflicts had increased to “once or twice a week”. Worse, these conflicts had grown in severity with chairs thrown around the matrimonial home and the parents brawling with slippers. Occasionally, the elder child would intervene in the scuffles to attempt to restrain the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The events came to a head in March 2025, when the mother left the matrimonial home and sought refuge at a crisis shelter. The father continued to reside in the matrimonial home with the children. The Child Protector was concerned about the safety of the children there, exercised its powers under s 11 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”) to commit them to the Interim Placement and Assessment Centre – Salvation Army Gracehaven pending its application for CPOs in respect of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The mother subsequently found rental accommodation with a landlord who had been a tenant at the matrimonial home but who had since procured her own apartment. The Child Protector corresponded with the landlord and assessed that she was a “safe adult” whose apartment would provide safe refuge to the children. Pending the determination of the CPOs, the Child Protector applied to the Youth Court for interim orders to return the children to the care of the mother, albeit under the supervision of an approved welfare officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 2 May 2025, the Youth Court granted these interim orders and directed that the children were to reside with the mother at the crisis shelter or at the residence of a safe adult as assessed and approved by the Child Protector. The Youth Court added that the father was to abstain from visiting the crisis shelter and the schools and tuition centres that the children attended without the approval of the Approved Welfare Officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 19 May 2025, the father appeared outside the gate of the school that the younger child was attending. He was seen by the Approved Welfare Officer, who deposed to this sighting in these proceedings. The Approved Welfare Officer deposed further that no approval had been granted to the father to so attend at the gate of the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 21 May 2025, the father appeared near the apartment of the safe adult. He spotted the mother at a carpark and confronted her about an application for a Personal Protection Order that she had filed against him. The mother reported this incident to the Child Protector the same day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 22 May 2025, the father appeared once again near the apartment of the safe adult. He spotted the younger child and followed the younger child to the apartment. He entered the apartment and confronted the mother, who told the children to leave before speaking with the father. The father subsequently left but returned to the apartment on two further occasions that same day and demanded to speak with the mother each time. The mother reported these incidents to the police and to the Child Protector.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 23 May 2025, the father appeared at the workplace of the mother and demanded to speak wit her. The mother called the police. When the police arrived, the father left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Before me, the Child Protector sought CPOs to place the children in the care of their mother under the supervision of an approved welfare officer for 12 months. It argued that the children were in need of care and protection within the CYPA on two grounds. First, that they were at risk of ill-treatment by their father because of violence that he had perpetrated on the elder child and on their mother. Second, that they were likely to suffer emotional harm because of emotional or psychological abuse to which they had been subject by their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The mother and the children agreed. The mother added that she would be happy to return to the matrimonial home with the children if the father moved out of the matrimonial home. The elder child desired to return to the matrimonial home under the care of the mother but not the father because of his strained relationship with the latter. The younger child desired to return to the matrimonial home under the care of both the parents and wished that they put their conflict behind them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The father disagreed and submitted that the children should return to living with him in the matrimonial home. He did not deny the broad narratives of the Child Protector, or the general acrimony between him and the mother. He shared a willingness to reside away from the family for “a month” but believed that separation for longer periods would further strain their relationship and was “not good for family development”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I agreed with the Child Protector that the children were in need of the care and protection of the State at least because they had suffered or were likely to suffer from emotional harm on account of emotional or psychological abuse by their parents within s 5(1)(g) of the CYPA. The notion of such “emotional or psychological abuse” by a parent was broad. As set out in s 5(2)(f) of the CYPA, it extended to exposing a child to or placing a child at risk of exposure to “violence against a related person of the child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     When the family resided together, the enmity between the parents produced conflict and violence. The triggers of such conflict and violence were many and included disagreements between the parents over the education of the children, the travel habits of the mother, and the unemployment of the father. These disagreements, in turn, appeared to stem from a divergence between the parents in their philosophies on marriage: the father viewed the mother as a homemaker who was to “abide by his instructions as he is the head of the household”. The mother expected that both parents share in the breadwinning and the homemaking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Child Protector described the father as an individual with “deep-rooted cultural beliefs that shapes his behaviour and expectations towards [the mother]”. It added that the father exerted “coercive control” over the mother by expecting her to “retur[n] home immediately after work by 7pm and prepar[e] dinner for the family” and “complete household chores and be responsible for the children’s academics to his standard”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Whether or not the expectations of the father were “coercive” of the mother, it sufficed for these proceedings that the philosophical divergence between them had escalated into frequent conflicts and violence in the presence of the children. Even after the intervention of the Child Protector in the family and the ensuing relocation of the mother, the parental conflict persisted with the father confronting the mother at her new residence in the presence of the children. Further, the parental conflict had affected the children adversely with the elder child sharing a strained relationship with the father and the younger child experiencing feelings of worry and fear during the incidents of conflict. It was thus evident that, without more, the children were at risk of emotional harm because of emotional or psychological abuse on account of the parental conflict that exposed them to violence between their parents. Further, it would be in the welfare and best interests of the children to place them on CPOs, under the care and protection of the State, while allied professionals engaged the parents on resolving their parental conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As for the specific CPOs to be made, I agreed with the Child Protector that it would be in the welfare of the children to place them in the care of their mother, with whom they both shared a functional relationship, for 12 months. The mother had been a caregiver for the children even as she travelled for work. Despite her relocation to the apartment of a safe adult, that environment remained suitable for the children because they had known the safe adult from their childhood when the safe adult was a tenant at the matrimonial home. Further, the mother would enjoy the support and supervision of an approved welfare officer in her care for the children under during these 12 months. The time would also provide the children with space, particularly from the father, to heal and mend their relationships with both of their parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To address the philosophical differences that underlay the parental conflicts and violence, I directed the family to attend such mediation, counselling, psychotherapy, assessments, programmes, and treatments as deemed necessary by the approved welfare officer. I also directed that the relevant professionals release medical, psychological, counselling, and relevant reports of the family to the approved welfare officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Meanwhile, to fortify the safety of the children, I ordered the parents to abstain from acts that will compromise the safety and well-being of the children as well as to participate in interviews and discuss and comply with the safety plans and caregiving arrangements agreed upon, with the approved welfare officer. Further, as sought by the Child Protector, the approved welfare officer was to approve and review the contacts of the father and his significant others with the children, and the father was to abstain from going to or near the apartment of the safe adult and the schools and tuition centres of the children.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-08-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1278 of 2024","title":"XQB v XQC","citation":"[2025] SGFC 82","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33639-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim May Li (Lim & Ong) for the Applicant","Michael Moey Chin Woon (Moey & Yuen) for the Respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-08-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XQB v XQC</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQB <em>v</em> XQC </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33639-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 82</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1278 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 August 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Lim May Li (Lim &amp; Ong) for the Applicant; Michael Moey Chin Woon (Moey &amp; Yuen) for the Respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XQB — XQC </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 August 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 1278/2024 (“SS 1278”) was the Sister’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against her Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both siblings were represented at the hearing before me. Ms Lim May Li (“Ms Lim”) acted for the Sister. Mr Michael Moey (“Mr Moey”) acted for the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of the matter and reserved judgment. I called for written submissions. Having considered the written submissions filed by Ms Lim and Mr Moey, judgment was delivered on 9 May 2025. I allowed the Sister’s application in SS 1278 with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There was no dispute as to the relevant legal principles that apply to an application for a PPO. An applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, the following two requirements in order to succeed in their application for a PPO (<em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [20]; <em>XMZ v XNA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33304-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 60</a> at [2]; <em>XMS v XMR and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33324-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 56</a> at [5]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, that family violence (as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> “had been committed, or was likely to be committed” against a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, that it is necessary for the protection of that family member that the court grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I found that the Brother had indeed committed an act of family violence, specifically, that he had, in an incident on 1 February 2024, caused hurt to his sister by “such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt” (to borrow the language of limb (<em>b</em>) of family violence in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Sister had produced CCTV footage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It showed the Brother chasing her. He caught up to her and tried to grab her by the neck. The Sister can be seen trying to break free from his grasp. The Brother pushed her up against the wall and grabbed her by the throat. The Sister only managed to break free when one of the employees intervened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In his written submissions, Mr Moey argues that the injuries which the Sister says she sustained “could not have been serious”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> That said, the definition of family violence as set out in limb (<em>b</em>) only includes acts which have caused hurt, or ought to have been known to result in hurt – and “hurt” is defined as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In short, it mattered not whether the injuries, which the Sister allegedly sustained in this scuffle on 1 February 2024, were severe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I found that the Brother’s actions, namely, grabbing the Sister by the neck, “ought to have been known to result in hurt”. That much was clear from the CCTV footage which showed how the Brother had grabbed the Sister by the neck.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having found that the Brother had committed an act of family violence on the Sister, I turned to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO. The law makes it clear that this involves a risk assessment as to whether the respondent is likely to, going forwards, commit family violence on the person sought to be protected under the PPO: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ms Lim argued that it was indeed necessary to order a PPO. She emphasised that parties were likely to have future interactions with each other as they both continue to manage and run the family business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Ms Lim also highlighted that the Brother remained deeply antagonistic towards the Sister as was evident from the various audio and video recordings that were played in court. In that regard, Ms Lim drew my attention to the various threats that the Brother had made against the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Finally, and in addition to those points, Ms Lim highlighted that the evidence showed an escalation in the family violence, and that the underlying cause of the family violence remains unresolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the other hand, Mr Moey argued that a PPO was not necessary for the Sister’s protection. He stated that the Sister had only begun to film the Brother in 2024, and that this resulted in the incidents of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Mr Moey also alluded to the fact that while it was true that the two siblings had to work together as they continued to run the family business, it was always open to the Sister to relocate her operations to one of the other properties that she owned. That she refused to do so, and insisted on staying, was telling of the fact that she knew that her Brother would not harm her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I found it necessary to order the PPO in the present case. For one, it was abundantly clear that the Brother had a fiery temper, and that he would direct his rage at the Sister. The videos and audio recordings amply demonstrated that. The manner in which the Brother had reacted demonstrated that he was, indeed, deeply antagonistic towards the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     While it may be the case that the Sister would provoke the Brother by deliberately filming him, I must point out that it was always open to the Brother to choose how he wished to react.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Further, given that both the Brother and Sister would still be involved in running the family business, and that entailed being physically on-site at the premises, this would mean that they are likely to come into contact and have future interactions with each other. While there was much made of the fact that a degree of separation between the two siblings could be achieved if the Sister simply moved out – the point remains that the both of them are still involved in the family business, and that means that, in all likelihood, they would continue to have interactions with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore allowed the Sister’s application in SS 1278. In addition, I also ordered that both parties go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As to the costs of SS 1278, Ms Lim argued that costs should be fixed at $25,000 (all-in) in favour of the Sister, taking into account the length of the trial, the number of documents filed, and the number of witnesses that testified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Mr Lim, on the other hand, argued that costs should be fixed “in the region” of $16,000 to $17,000 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given that the Sister had prevailed in her application, she was entitled to costs. Having regard to the length of the trial which took 2 full days before me, the number of affidavits filed and the number of witnesses, I fixed costs at $10,000 (all-in). I also ordered that these costs be paid by the Brother to the Sister by 20 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I conclude with a few words to both parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     If one looks across culture and history, it is clear that the bond between siblings has always been a strong and celebrated one. For instance, there is a saying that “blood is thicker than water”. In the Edda (which is a collection of old Norse poems), the ending of the world was marked by brothers fighting each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In this connection, I would say: do not so hastily abandon the ties of kinship that you share. Set aside your grievances and to try to work on rebuilding your relationship as siblings. I have heard evidence of how the both of you were once close.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I see no reason why that cannot be the case going forward, but you must both be willing to put in the work to mend what has been broken. In that vein, take the counselling seriously. It is meant to equip you with the necessary tools with a view to tackling the underlying cause of your conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It remains for me to thank Ms Lim and Mr Moey for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Video titled MCST CCTV Footage Attack 2024-02-01.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Brother’s Written Submissions at para 43.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Brother’s Written Submissions at para 96.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Snorri Sturluson (Anthony Faulkes trans.) <em>Edda</em> (Everyman, 1987) at p 53: Brothers will fight and kill each other, cousins will break the bonds of their relationship.
