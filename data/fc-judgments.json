This application directly concerns the question of whether a young child of 4 years should be examined by a psychologist or qualified therapist, and also raised issues regarding the impact of high-conflict divorces on young children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I declined to grant the application in this case, as I did not find it necessary or in the best interests of the child to subject him to a psychological assessment. It is essential to first understand the background to this application, before I explain my reasons below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties were married in January 2016 and they have a young child, A, who is currently 4 years old. The Plaintiff mother (“the Mother”) filed for divorce in March 2023, citing the unreasonable behaviour of the Defendant father (“the Father”). Interim Judgment was granted on 20 June 2023. On 31 July 2023, the Father filed a Summons application for interim access to A (SUM 2404/2023). On 16 August 2023, the Mother filed a Summons application to restrain the Father from removing A from school before the end of the school day (SUM 2579/2023).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Consent Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 12 September 2023, the parties attended mediation in court and the following consent orders were recorded:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Pending the resolution of SUM 2404/2023 for interim access, the Father shall have interim access to A:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_a\"></a>(a)       From 5-6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays; during which time the Father shall take A to the nearby playground located at B Park. Such access shall commence on 18 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_b\"></a>(b)       From 9am to 1.30pm on Saturdays. The Father shall take A to a public place, including XX Club, and there shall be no restrictions as to who will accompany the Father during his time with A. Such access shall commence on 16 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_i-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The Mother’s domestic helper shall accompany A during all access sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The Father shall pick A up from the matrimonial home located at XY (“the Matrimonial Home”) at the start of each access session and return A to the Matrimonial Home at the end of each access session. The Father shall be at liberty to have another person accompany him during the pick ups / drop offs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     For the avoidance of doubt, the Father shall be permitted to open the front gate of the Matrimonial Home for the purposes of backing his car into the front porch of the Matrimonial Home during such pick ups / drop offs but shall remain in his motor vehicle while waiting for A. In the event that the Father walks to the Matrimonial Home for the access, he may open the front gate of the Matrimonial Home for the purposes of picking A up or returning A but shall not enter the Matrimonial Home; and shall leave as soon as he picks A up or returns A to the Mother or the domestic helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     All orders are subject to changes if there are further Court orders / agreement between the parties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_v\"></a>(v)     The interim arrangements contained in this order are not an admission of the parties’ positions; and are without prejudice to the parties’ positions and the parties can still rely on their respective summonses during the hearing of the said summonses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     The Father shall not be permitted to enter the matrimonial home located at XY save to pick up some of his personal belongings. In such event, the Father shall only pick up his personal belongings with prior appointment arranged and written agreement with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_vii\"></a>(vii)     Save for an emergency or if A is ill, neither the Mother nor the Father shall remove A out of school before the end of the school day at 4.30 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_viii\"></a>(viii)    Neither the Mother nor the Father shall visit A in school during the course of the school day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_ix\"></a>(ix)     The Mother shall send and pick up A to and from school every day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>For ease of reference, these orders dated 12 September 2023 are collectively referred to as “the Consent Orders”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Present Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Mother’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother filed the present application, SUM 2985/2023, on 25 September 2023. The application is for (i) a psychologist from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) or specific therapist to examine the child, A, for “purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”; and (ii) in the interim, pending the psychologist’s report, parties to have joint custody of A, the Mother to have care and control and the Father to have interim access as per the terms of the Consent Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother claimed that the application was necessary because A started behaving differently after the commencement of divorce proceedings in March 2023, and that the Father and his family members began to treat A “differently”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Mother claimed that (i) the Father started to take A up to his bedroom to the exclusion of her domestic helper, instead of allowing A to roam freely in his parents’ home; and (ii) the Father and his family members started “speaking negatively”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> about the Mother to A, telling A that he would be living with them and they would care for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother also claimed that the Father started<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> buying more toys to “bribe and manipulate” A, and picking A up from school and “prevented” the Mother’s domestic helper from exiting the vehicle to pick A up from the school lobby or only picked the helper up after he had already picked A up from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       More significantly, the Mother claimed that the Father and his family members had engaged in what she termed as “negative stoking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, which allegedly caused confusion and distress in A. She stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> A would often return to the Matrimonial Home after access “looking very disoriented and confused” and would have frequent temper tantrums and meltdowns; and would wake up multiple times in the night crying for the Mother, which he did not do before. The Mother also claimed that after A returned from access, he began<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> bed wetting and soiling himself or on the floor when he had previously been able to use the toilet. The Mother brought A to see a play therapist, who apparently informed her that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> there was a lot of “dysregulation” in A and that A is “very high need” and needs a “high level of control due to his insecurities”. Subsequently, the Mother brought A to a second therapist in September 2023, as the first therapist apparently “did not want to be involved”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in the Summons application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Mother’s case was that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> she filed this application as A had been “severely and adversely affected by the changes caused by the behaviour of the Father and his family members following the commencement of [d]ivorce [p]roceedings, particularly the negative stoking”, and she wanted the appointed psychologist to<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (a) work with A “through his feelings and help him to manage” his dysregulation; (b) assess A and “determine if he has been destabilised and/or negatively affected” by exposure to the Father and his family; and (c) make recommendations for the Father’s access to A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father submitted that the application was another bid by the Mother to “entrench her position”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> over A’s care and control, and to reduce his access to A as the Mother was really unhappy with the Father for not parenting A “in the way that she wants”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Father objected to the psychological assessment of A because he took the view that the assessment “may cause short-term and long-term harm”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The Father also submitted that a psychologist’s report would not be helpful because A is extremely young, and it would be difficult to ascertain any factual causes for A’s mental or emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father denied that he or his parents had engaged in any “negative stoking” of A, or that A’s movements were restricted in his parents’ home during access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. In response to the Mother’s allegations that A started to behave differently due to the different treatment by the Father and his family members after divorce proceedings began, the Father pointed out that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> the Mother’s accounts of events from March 2023 onwards showed that any change in A’s behaviour may not have been due to the Father’s or his family member’s actions. The Mother claimed that A began to act up in March 2023, and in April 2023, she changed her work arrangements to pick A up earlier to spend more time with him. The Mother again adjusted her work schedule subsequently so she could spend more time with A, and A then started full-day school in mid-July 2023. She also stated that the Father’s time with A did not change much from February to June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father also denied that he had spoken negatively of the Mother to A, and had only said to A that “<em>papa can feed you”, “papa can shower you”</em> or “<em>you can stay at por por’s house”</em> or words to that effect. The Father highlighted that before the divorce proceedings, the Mother had been fine with A staying at his parents’ home, and with his parents and sister helping with A’s care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law regarding examination of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Section 28 of the FJA 2014 provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>In any proceedings before a Family Court involving the custody or welfare of a child or involving a person, the Court may, on the application of any party to those proceedings or on its own motion, appoint a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child or person (as the case may be) for the purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The accompanying subsidiary legislation is in rules 35 and 36 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“the FJR 2014”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<b><em>35.-</em></b>(<em>1</em>)     <em>Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action of proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>4</em>)     <em>Where a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional who is not appointed by the Court pursuant to an application under paragraph (1) examines or assesses the child, no evidence arising out of the examination or assessment may be adduced without the leave of the Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>36.</em></b>      <em>When considering any question relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to any child, the Court may, on its own motion and with a view to obtaining a report on the welfare of the child, direct that the child be examined or assessed by a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or has experience in matters relating to child welfare.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Purpose of appointing a child expert</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Welfare of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Before ordering a child to undergo an assessment pursuant to section 28 of the FJA 2014, the assessment must be for the “<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in”</em> the proceedings involving the custody or welfare of the child. Similarly, rules 35 and 36 of the FJR 2014 provide that the expert evidence must be required in determining questions relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 125 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Women’s Charter”) makes it clear that the <b>paramount</b> consideration in all custody, care and control proceedings is the welfare of the child. The expert evidence is just one factor to be taken into account and the judge is at liberty to depart from expert recommendations if, after considering <em>all</em> relevant factors, they are not deemed to be in the welfare of the child. Indeed, section 130 of the Women’s Charter provides that the judge is not bound to follow the advice of a person trained or experienced in child welfare, when determining questions relating to the custody, care and control of a child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“130</em>.     <em>When considering any question relating to the custody, or the care and control, of any child, the court is to, whenever it is practicable, have regard to the advice of a person, whether or not a public officer, who is trained or experienced in child welfare but is not bound to follow such advice.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The assessment of a child is not simply a fact-finding exercise but may be better described as a forensic one, in order to gain <em>expert</em> insight/evidence on issues which are relevant to the proceedings in which leave for such assessment is sought. It should therefore be clear why the expert evidence is required, and what questions it would answer, relating to the welfare or interest of, or relating to the custody, care and control of and access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In child-related proceedings in the UK, the court’s permission is similarly required before a child may be medically or psychiatrically examined or otherwise assessed for the purposes of providing expert evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The UK Children and Families Act 2014 provides that such expert evidence must be<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> “<em>necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings justly</em>”; and includes several factors which the court should consider in deciding whether to give permission for the examination or expert evidence. Such factors include (a) the impact of the examination or assessment on the welfare of the child; (b) the issues to which the expert evidence would relate; (c) the questions which the court would require the expert to answer; (d) what other expert evidence is available; (e) whether evidence could be given by another person on the matters on which the expert would give evidence; (f) the impact on the timeline, duration and conduct of the proceedings; and (g) the cost of the expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the relevant legislation in the UK is worded differently from section 28 of the FJA 2014, the factors in the Children and Families Act 2014 provide a helpful reference when considering whether assessment of children should be ordered and whether expert evidence is required. In <em>L v. J</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4764-M.xml')\">[1999] SGHC 258</a>, which concerned the variation of access and allegations of abuse, the applicant produced two psychiatric reports to support her assertion that the respondent’s conduct had adversely affected the mental wellbeing of the children. The court found the children’s psychiatric reports “unnecessary” and stated that it was in the children’s interests to keep them out of the dispute between the parents as much as possible. The High Court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> parties in every case should first consider whether a psychiatric assessment can truly be in the interests of the child, taking into consideration that such an assessment may take a toll on a young child’s mind and “<em>exacerbate feelings of guilt, anxiety and fear arising from the break-up of the family”.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> the “<em>best course of action in any custody and access dispute is for it to be resolved… without the children being taken to see any counsellor or psychiatrist at all. </em><b><em>Seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for an assessment in order for the custody and access disputes to be resolved (as opposed to seeing a counsellor or psychiatrist for therapeutic purposes) may damage the child by enhancing his awareness of the dispute between his parents, making him acutely conscious that he is the center of this dispute, and giving him the idea that his responses may have some influence in this dispute, and that he must therefore bear some responsibility in respect of its outcome</em></b><em>.”</em> [emphasis is my own]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Thus, it should be asked whether such <em>expert</em> evidence is really necessary, or whether the information sought may be obtained through other means which are less intrusive to the child, for example, by instead conducting a judge-child interview, or by ordering a specific issues report which is conducted by a court family specialist from FJC’s Counselling and Psychological Services (“CAPS”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Any psychiatric or psychological assessment, while not involving a physical examination of the body, should nevertheless be treated as a medical intervention. Just as a parent would not hastily insist that a child undergo surgery with general anesthesia to repair a sprained ankle, similarly parents should not be so eager to offer up their children’s minds and thoughts to be dissected and picked over by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Divorcing parents should recognise that custody disputes do <b>not</b> warrant immediate psychological or psychiatric intervention for children without good reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Utility of assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is important to ascertain the questions to be answered by the expert evidence. If the information sought by the court can only be answered by an expert and is not merely factual, then an expert assessment may be required. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the court found that the expert<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>“<em>must give an explanation which supplies the understanding of the subject which the court lacks</em>”. In <em>In re C (Fam D)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/77525-E.xml')\">[2024] 1 WLR 1</a>, it was stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> an allegation of whether a parent had alienated a child against the other parent was “<em>a question of fact for the court to resolve and not a diagnosis that can or should be offered by a psychologist</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In <em>UVM v. UVN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23230-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 56</a>, the court found that the purpose of rule 35 of the FJR 2014 was to “<em>ensure that a child is not subject to unnecessary psychological assessment which could of itself lead to issues of its own”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></em>. It was noted there that the psychological assessment was conducted when the child was aged 2 years 8 months, and it was doubtful whether the answers from, or any tests conducted on, such a young child would be reliable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the ages of 3 to 4, children’s speech and thinking are still in the early stages of development, and their use of speech and vocabulary is extremely limited. Their cognitive skills are not fully developed, and they may not be able to express themselves clearly. A is only 4 years old now, and it would be difficult to elicit information from him which is useful for the current proceedings, even with the assistance of a trained expert. The Mother herself admitted that she did not apply for a custody evaluation report (CER) or access evaluation report (AER) because she thought that being only 4 years old, A “<em>may not be able to express himself to a CER or AER officer</em>” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. The Mother has not shown how a trained psychologist or therapist would be in a better position to elicit more information from A than an AER or CER officer (who is usually a trained counsellor or social worker).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Not therapeutic or aimed at fault-finding or attributing blame</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It is also useful to look at the reasons for which a psychological assessment of a child should <b><u>not</u></b> be ordered. It is clear from <em>JBM v. JBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16706-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 429</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> that the court-ordered psychological assessment of children is <b>not</b> meant to be therapeutic or preventive in nature. For completeness, <em>JBM v. JBN</em> pre-dated section 28 of the FJA 2014 and concerned the equivalent rule 41 of the now-repealed Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules (Cap 353, R 4) (“the MPR”). Rule 41 of the MPR is the predecessor rule to rules 35-36 of the FJR 2014; and is drafted in a similar manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“(1</em>)     <em>After proceedings have been commenced under Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a party shall not, without the leave of court, cause a child to be examined or assessed by any psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor or other social work professional or mental health professional for the purpose of the preparation of expert evidence for use in the proceedings for ancillary relief involving the custody and welfare of the child.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother’s application sought to have the appointed child psychologist help to “<em>address and manage any negative feelings”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></em> A may have, and to “<em>ascertain the reasons for his distress”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></em>. In the specific prayers of the Mother’s amended Summons, it is stated that the psychological examination of A is for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>purposes of preparing expert evidence in the form of report”, to set out the “assessment of A’s mental and emotional state”, and whether he has been “destabilised/negatively affected because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>recommendations for the Defendant’s access to A in light of his/her findings above</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother goes on in the affidavits to state that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>a child psychologist needs to be appointed to assess [A] and to recommend the care arrangements moving forward since:</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take cognizance of any of the troubling evidence before him of [A]’s distress; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>)     <em>The Defendant does not seem to take into consideration my observations of [A] despite being his primary caregiver.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“I am genuinely concerned about </em> <em><u>the Defendant’s behaviour and the effect it has had on [A]</u></em> <em>.

It is clear, as explained above, that ordering a child to be assessed for the purposes of preparing expert evidence <b>cannot</b> be therapeutic in nature. If the court determines that a child in divorce proceedings requires therapeutic intervention for his/her trauma or distress, orders may be made for the child to undergo counselling or therapy, or, in serious cases, to see a psychiatrist/psychologist to undergo treatment. That is however very different from ordering a child to undergo assessment for the <em>purposes</em> of obtaining expert evidence to assist the court in answering questions that only an expert can. The former is ordered for the primary purpose of treating the child, and not for the determination of an outcome in custody proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     An application for a court-ordered assessment of a child must not be used as a means of blame-attributing or fault-finding on the part of one parent. The assessment must be an objective forensic exercise necessitated for the welfare of the child. The way the Mother’s prayers in the application are phrased, what she seeks to be determined is whether A has been negatively affected “<em>because of exposure to the Defendant and/or his family</em>” and for the expert to make recommendations for the Father’s access to A “<em>in light of his/her findings above</em>”. The proposed questions to be posed to the expert are also based on the premise or assumption that A’s current emotional state is due to the Father and/or his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, and are self-serving. Even if the questions posed to the expert are reframed from those sought in the Mother’s application, I am of the view that there is no need for expert evidence of this nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     What is important here is that we deal with the issue of how we can help A through this difficult adjustment period in his life, and not subject him to a psychological <em>assessment</em> for the purposes of determining how much access the Father should have. I do not think that the exact causes of A’s alleged dysregulation can be determined by an assessment, given A’s tender age and limited ability to express himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     After considering all the relevant factors, I am not convinced that it is necessary or in the best interests or welfare of A to order a psychological or therapeutic assessment to be undertaken. I also do not see the utility of the expert evidence sought to be ordered in this case. While I do not doubt that A has been experiencing changes such as waking up and crying in the middle of the night, temper tantrums and a certain amount of regression with respect to his toileting habits, it is important to understand the effects of divorce and parental conflict on a child of his age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A was only 3 years old when the divorce proceedings commenced. Children of this age are too young to fully understand and comprehend changes around them. They are extremely sensitive to changes in their routine and daily life and are unable to express themselves clearly. Young children are also very attuned to the moods and feelings of their caregivers and the people around them, and may react accordingly. If a parent whom the child is close to is anxious or upset, the child may mirror the emotions of the parent by crying or throwing tantrums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Effects of divorce on young children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is not unusual that A feels the stresses and impact of the divorce and custody proceedings; and is thus acting out or exhibiting regressive behaviour. Constant exposure to conflict and stressors can severely impact a child. Even the observation of conflict between parents is a direct stressor for children, and divorce is a “<em>summary variable that represents a variety of circumstances that many children experience as stressful</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     On the Family Assist website hosted by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, it is stated that a child aged 3-4 years, who is exposed to the conflict of divorce, may become “clingier and throws more tantrums by crying, screaming, or kicking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In <em>BF v. BG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29855-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 115</a>, the learned District Judge opined that “<em>Children in a divorce situation may feel more sensitive to the presence or absence of a parent than children in a non-divorce situation. They may need more reassurance that the non-custodial parent is a constant presence in their lives, in order to feel secure.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Parents should also be aware of the “normal” changes a young child goes through as they are growing up, through different stages of their lives. It is not uncommon for a young child to regress in development sometimes due to growing pains, stressful stages of their lives or picking up on parents’ anxiety and trauma. Young children who have been toilet-trained may occasionally wet the bed, or wake up multiple times a night where previously they used to sleep through. How can one distinguish whether this is a phase of development, or whether the child has been truly traumatised and requires professional intervention?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     One would only have to perform a web search for “child regression” to find that thousands of books, perhaps more, have been written on this topic. This is probably because regression is a normal part of child development and is usually in reaction to a stressor. A change in caregivers, in school timings, in routine, can all be potential stressors for young children who are unable to verbalise accurately what they feel at the tender age of 4. As children develop and adapt to new surroundings, some form of regression may be expected. Highly sensitive children may be even more prone to regression as they have been shown to be more reactive to changes in their environment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Since the divorce proceedings were commenced in March 2023, the parties appeared to have engaged in one-upmanship behaviour where each was trying to show that they were the better parent, or spent more time with A. The Mother also admitted that around April 2023, she changed her work arrangements in order to pick A up from school earlier. While the Mother claimed that the Father had also disrupted A’s routine and schedule by picking A up early from school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>, she admitted that this was only done over a 2-week period. The Mother claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> A’s dysregulation was at its “peak” between 22 July and 11 August 2023. However, the Mother herself also took A out of school early, and this was evidenced in the correspondence dated 13 July 2023 from the Father’s then-solicitors to the Mother’s then-solicitors<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. During this period, the Father also claimed that the Mother had reduced his access to A, as she was picking A up from school or his parents’ home early. The parties’ conflict culminated in an incident on 24 August 2023, in the presence of A, where there was a physical altercation and the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order for herself, and a Domestic Exclusion Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is also undisputed that A started attending full-day school from July 2023 onwards, which is yet another change to his daily routine. In short, A had experienced, in the short span of just a few months, many major changes in his daily life. After the proceedings commenced, A saw less of the Father, the parties took turns to take him out of school early, and he then started full-day school. His routine and schedule also changed in that previously, after school, he would spend time at his paternal grandparents’ home and the Father would return early to play with him before the Mother brought him back to the matrimonial home. However, the Mother then started to bring him back to the matrimonial home earlier, so that he spent less time with the Father and his paternal grandparents. A was also present during the parties’ altercation on 24 August 2023. All these changes could very well cause A to feel extremely insecure and unmoored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The “negative stoking”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Mother’s evidence that the Father and his family members had been saying “negative” things about her to A consisted mainly of: (a) her observations of A saying certain things like<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> “<em>does not want to go home</em>, <em>you can stay at por por’s house, papa can take care of you, papa can feed you, papa can shower you, you don’t need stupid mama, you can sleep on papa’s bed, you can sleep with aunty xxx</em>, <em>mama wants to take papa away, please don’t take my papa away, mama please return my papa</em>”; and (b) her domestic helper C’s affidavit evidence. The Mother concluded that since A was only 3 years old at the time, he would not know how to say such things and would only say them if they had been “told to him in this manner”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Mother also relied on several transcripts of audio and video recordings, presumably to show the effects of the “negative stoking” on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“[00:47] Kid: Such a very hard day.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>[00:50] Woman: Such a very hard day, huh?

Even where A apparently tries to hit the Father or refuses him, and I note that these video recordings were taken in October 2023, these incidents occurred at the height of the parties’ acrimony when there were access disputes and multiple applications filed by parties. Given the upheaval in A’s life at this time, it is not unexpected that he would exhibit adjustment issues and act out. The Father has also pointed out that there was also evidence of the Mother saying negative things about him to A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>, such as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>You are scared to talk to your Papa is it? Why are you scared to talk to your Papa?</em>”<em>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It is clear from the very voluminous affidavits and multiple transcripts of recordings submitted by the Mother, that she harbours strong negative feelings against the Father. A young child’s emotional state can be significantly influenced by that of his primary caregiver. It is likely that A could have picked up on the Mother’s strong emotions against the Father, thus causing him to be clingier to the Mother. It is also possible that A is emotionally affected by the Father’s frustration at the restrictions placed on his access, and acts out due to confusion. I point this out because I do not think that it is possible for anyone to definitively point to the alleged “negative stoking” of A as the determinative factor for A’s dysregulation or regression; there could be many other factors contributing to A’s emotional state. What is clear to me is that, on a balance of probabilities, the very acrimonious relationship between the parties, their conflict and constant litigation is causing stress and confusion to A, and both parties have a part to play in this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the circumstances, while I dismiss the prayer for A to be examined by a psychologist or therapist for the purposes of preparing expert evidence in the proceedings, I recognise that there is a need for A to receive some intervention to help him to cope with the parties’ conflict and divorce. I therefore order the parties to <b>jointly</b> engage a play therapist for A, for the purposes of helping A to deal with the proceedings and the parties’ acrimonious relationship. A report is not required as the play therapy is not required for the purposes of expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Using video and audio recordings of children for proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the present case, I had on 16 January 2024 ordered that neither parent or their agent is to take audio or video recordings of A with the other parent, and save for exceptional circumstances, neither party is to submit any further audio or video recordings of A in affidavit. I had explained to both counsel that especially for young children such as A, repeatedly taking video or audio recordings of the child with one parent for the purposes of proceedings is extremely detrimental to the child’s welfare. I was concerned as the Mother had, in a supplementary affidavit filed earlier, adduced almost a hundred pages of transcriptions from video and audio recordings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. In the Mother’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she also adduced further evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> of more transcriptions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>VZZ v. WAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27115-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 11</a>, I had stated that in adducing evidence of multiple video and audio recordings, parties should really consider whether such evidence is really of assistance to the court, and more importantly, the impact of such recordings on the welfare of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. The High Court had also stated in <em>CLB v. CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27071-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 3</a> that photographs, video and/or audio recordings <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>“<em>are not always of assistance to the court – they may capture a moment (or several moments) in time</em>” but they do not capture events or interactions leading up to, or after, that particular moment. While such evidence may be relevant, it may carry weight that is “disproportionately prejudicial” to its relevance. Repeatedly photographing or filming children is also extremely intrusive and may constantly remind a child that he/she is being “used” in court proceedings. There is also the concern<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> of the possible impact of such recordings on the child in the long run: how would the child feel knowing that his/her past actions, behaviour and words were captured as evidence and used by one parent against the other? </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, I would remind both parents that while one parent may have interim care and control and the other parent has access, it is <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>“<em>erroneous and unhelpful to co-parenting for the parent with sole care and control to hold the view that he or she is the better or more important parent”</em>. It cannot be over-emphasised that effective joint or co-parenting is important in helping children to adjust to divorce and separation. As stated in <em>TAU v. TAT [</em>2018] 5 SLR 1089:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“While the parties take issue with each other’s parenting style, they must know that it is their divorce that has ultimately taken the greatest toll on the children. The parties’ acrimonious litigation and relationship have produced terrible effects on their children, psychologically, mentally, emotionally and even physically.

SUM 1631/2024 (“SUM 1631”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1632/2024 (“SUM 1632”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. My substantive decision in respect of both SUM 1631 and 1632 can be found in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Helena Amolak (“Ms Amolak”) argues that there should be no order as to costs for two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       First, that both parties had equally succeeded in their respective applications – if one applies the trite principle that costs follow the event, this would effectively mean that the costs which the Husband was entitled to in respect of his own application would be cancelled out by the costs he would have to pay in respect of the Wife’s application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Second, there was a moderately high degree of acrimony between the parties. In particular, Ms Amolak highlights the dispute between the Husband and the Wife over care and control and access to the children, and the extensive litigation that had taken place. There was thus ample reason, according to Ms Amolak who cited the High Court decision in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), to make no order as to costs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Mr Jevan Li (“Mr Li”), who represented the Wife, took a different view as to costs. He argued that the Husband should be ordered to pay costs of $1200 for SUM 1631. As for SUM 1632, the Wife should be ordered to pay costs of $300.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Mr Li justifies the sums sought on the basis that SUM 1631 was the more contested and complex summons as more time was spent on this summons at the hearing compared to SUM 1632. Mr Li also highlights that more work was done in respect of SUM 1631 as compared to SUM 1632.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, this is an appropriate case in which to apply the principles laid down in <em>JBB</em>. I agree with Ms Amolak that there is indeed much acrimony between the parties which has had an impact on their two daughters. That much is clear to me from the various documents and reports on the record. I consider that making any award of costs in this case could well, as Ms Amolak points out,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> sow further discontent between the parties and potentially have a negative impact on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       There shall therefore be no order as to costs for both SUM 1631 and 1632.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at paras 4 – 8 and 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Probate – Validity of will – Forgery – Conflicting handwriting analysis"],"date":"2024-07-29","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/S 16/2020","title":"WZJ v WZK and another","citation":"[2024] SGFC 49","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31850-SSP.xml","counsel":["Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants."],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>WZJ v WZK and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZJ <em>v</em> WZK and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31850-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 49</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/S 16/2020</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">29 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Hsu Sheng Wei, Keith (Emerald Law LLC) for the Plaintiff; Mahmood Gaznavi S/O Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi Chambers LLC) for the Defendants. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZJ — WZK — WZL </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Probate</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Validity of will</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Forgery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Conflicting handwriting analysis</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">29 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The central issue in this case is the validity of a will which was executed in Malaysia (<em>Malaysian will</em>) about 7 months after the testator executed one in Singapore (<em>Singapore will</em>). The testator passed away on 20 October 2019 and very soon after, there was chaotic engagement amongst family members on the validity of the Malaysian will and who should rightfully benefit from the estate of the deceased. Such engagement involved various allegations made by family members against each other including what each believed would be the intentions of the deceased based on the tenor of his relationship with each member during his lifetime. The plaintiff is the son of the deceased. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the eldest daughter of the deceased while the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a lady who lived with the deceased in Malaysia for some time prior to the latter’s demise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Having heard the matter, I found for the plaintiff and declared the Malaysian will invalid. I ordered that probate be granted based on the Singapore will instead. I however dismissed the plaintiff’s application for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be removed as executor of the Singapore will and similarly dismissed the plaintiff’s application for letters of administration with the Singapore will annexed to be granted to him (or in the alternative, that he be appointed as the sole executor). The counterclaim was dismissed in its entirety. As parties could not agree on costs, I ordered costs of $90 000 (all in) to be paid by the defendants jointly and severally. The parties appeal against the substantive orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The deceased and his wife were divorced in 2005 and appear to have shared a cordial relationship after the divorce. From the union there are 3 children; 2 daughters and a son. As referenced above, the plaintiff is the deceased’s son, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is his eldest child and daughter. The other daughter will be referred to as the younger daughter for purposes of these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that the deceased executed his first will in August 2016 which left all his assets to his brother. It was also not disputed that the deceased then executed a will on 30 May 2017 in Singapore which effectively revoked the August 2016 will. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant suggested that the deceased was influenced by his other 2 children and their mother into executing the Singapore will. The will names the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor and trustee and the plaintiff as the subsititute executor if one of many listed events were to occur. Under the Singapore will, the estate of the deceased was to be divided equally amongst his 3 children. At the time the Singapore will was executed, the deceased was living in his ex-wife’s home to enable assistance for his medical appointments in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The deceased unfortunately suffered a heart attack sometime in June 2017 and was admitted to a Singapore hospital. After his discharge, he stayed with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at her home. It was the plaintiff’s position that the deceased was asked by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to leave her residence and he then lived in Johor from December 2017. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant stated that she did not ask that her father leave.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In any event, a third will dated 28 December 2017 was claimed by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to have been executed by the deceased in Malaysia. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as the executor and trustee and the beneficiaries of the estate are the deceased’s 2 grandsons. These are the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is not disputed that the defendants are close friends. It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position however that she only knew of the existence of the Malaysian will when informed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on 8 November 2019. On 16 November 2019 the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant showed the Malaysian will to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who then claimed to have returned it and not to have taken note of the contents of the will save for the fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was named as executor and trustee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although there was communication between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and her mother on the existence of the Malaysian will in early December 2019, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant proceeded to file an application for probate in January 2020 based on the Singapore will. She claimed that she acted in this way as she felt pressure from her mother and siblings. Further, she claimed that she was not legally trained to understand the significance of acting in the way she did.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The validity of the Singapore will</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is trite law that the burden of propounding a will lies in every case upon the party propounding the will (<b><em>ULV v ULW)</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Section 5 and 6 of the Wills Act (1838) provide the rules for the formal validity of wills and the mode of execution, respectively. The Singapore will was properly executed. There was no allegation of a lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Both the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant together with their mother were present when the deceased executed the will in his lawyer’s office in Singapore. Its execution was in the presence of 2 witnesses, one of whom was the deceased’s lawyer (<em>the Singapore lawyer</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Although there was suggestion by the 1st defendant that the Singapore will was executed under the influence of her mother and siblings, this was not a challenge that she robustly pursued. It would also be rather odd that the 1st defendant was named as the executor and equal beneficiary, if there were such influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the Malaysian will was rejected </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     After the divorce between the deceased and his wife in 2005, the 2nd defendant stated that she came to know the deceased. She was an administrative staff member at one of the deceased’s companies from 2009.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It was her evidence that the deceased lived in a house in Johor more permanently from 2013 or 2014<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and travelled to Singapore during the weekends. She also said that she looked after him in Malaysia. In fact, she was present in the house when the deceased was found dead in the early morning of 20 October 2019 when she woke up from sleep. He was found only in underclothes and remained in that state on the floor of the home till the ambulance arrived. The plaintiff and other family members expressed their unhappiness at finding the deceased in such a state and pointed to a lack of care by the 2nd defendant whether fairly or otherwise, in taking care of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was the 2nd defendant’s evidence that the deceased went to a lawyer’s office in Malaysia to execute the Malaysian will on 28 December 2017. She claimed that she was present in the room when the deceased executed the will. She was named as executor and trustee. The execution of the will was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer and a former driver of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The deceased had assets in Singapore and Malaysia, including immoveable properties and businesses. Three of these businesses were named after the plaintiff perhaps suggesting a sense of closeness to his son. The Malaysian will however made reference to specific Malaysian assets while only referring generally to all other assets in the name of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(i) The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the witnesses to the execution of the Malaysian will could not be safely relied on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was the 2nd defendant’s position that the reason why there was a sudden change of heart on the part of the deceased leading him to revoke the Singapore will was because the plaintiff stole the title deeds to the deceased’s Malaysian properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This was disputed by the plaintiff who claimed that his father had told him on numerous occasions that the same Malaysian lawyer who had apparently drafted and witnessed the Malaysian will could not be trusted and that the lawyer had taken the title deeds to one of his properties and had sold the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The plaintiff had also stated that the deceased had on one occasion, asked his children whether he should lend S$35 000 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant for a coffee shop business. Only the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was in favour of this. The money was lent and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant engaged the Malaysian lawyer to assist in setting up the business. The business never materialised and the money unaccounted for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The suggestion from the plaintiff was that the Malaysian lawyer and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant cannot be trusted. In my view, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is to be believed on her position that the deceased was unhappy with the plaintiff thus prompting him to make a new will with the assistance of the Malaysian lawyer, why would his other children be removed from benefitting from his estate. His unhappiness was only with the plaintiff. I accepted the plaintiff’s position that there was much more that appears to have transpired between the deceased and the Malaysian lawyer in the past and between the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the Malaysian lawyer which makes the Malaysian will a document that required further scrutiny.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is also in my view unbelievable as there was no reason for her to omit to inform the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant about the Malaysian will until the deceased had passed away almost 2 years later. They were both close and supportive of each other. It is more likely that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant always knew of the Malaysian will and not as she claimed, only in November 2019. In fact under cross-examination the Malaysian lawyer met with the plaintiff and his mother on 6 November 2019 but informed them that he did not have a copy of the Malaysian will with him. Soon after the visit, the Malaysian lawyer claimed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant informed him that she had given it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the latter arriving at the Malaysian lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 already having with her a copy of the will. Even at this point, knowing that the plaintiff wanted a copy of it, the Malaysian lawyer did not retain a copy nor inform the plaintiff that he was in possession of it. To complicate matters even further, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant under cross – examination denied passing it to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also claimed that she never brought the Malaysian will to the Malaysian lawyer on 13 November 2019 and insisted that the Malaysian lawyer was mistaken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian will did not rather strangely, appoint the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor of the will (as was the case in the Singapore will) even though the impression created by both defendants was that the relationship between the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the deceased was extremely good.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While the Malaysian will is dramatically different from the Singapore will insofar as it relates to the beneficiaries named, the deceased did not choose to change his nomination for his CPF money which mirrored the distribution of assets in his Singapore will. If the deceased was so angry with the plaintiff that he chose to change his will to provide only for his grandsons, that anger did not find expression in the way his CPF money was to be distributed. This raises concerns with the evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on the reason why the deceased wanted to remove the plaintiff from his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There are in my view large concerns with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer and the second witness to the will. The plaintiff had consistently and vehemently insisted that the deceased had informed him that the Malaysian lawyer could not be trusted. This was echoed by his younger sister on finding out from the plaintiff that there was possibly a Malaysian will that was witnessed by the Malaysian lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> An aunt of the plaintiff and his siblings who lived in Johor since 2017 and visited the deceased often, stated that she was told by the deceased that he had executed a will that distributed his estate equally amongst his children. There was never any mention otherwise including any conversation that revealed that he had gone to a Malaysian lawyer to execute another will. In particular, the deceased never spoke of leaving anything to his grandchildren.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The aunt in fact shared that the deceased said that he would give a little more to the plaintiff and his younger daughter when he spoke of specific properties in Singapore and Malaysia as he felt that he had already provided more to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The aunt was not shown to have any greater affiliation to the plaintiff. Another witness lent force to the plaintiff’s narrative. A former driver of the deceased<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> who served him from 2017 till he passed on, spoke of having driven him to many places in Singapore and Malaysia. This included places where the deceased would meet the plaintiff and his younger sister, to the ex-wife’s home and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s home, suggesting that the deceased maintained a cordial relationship with all the family members even if there may have been challenges over the years. This former driver said that he was never asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. He also shared how the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s husband asked for a share of the deceased’s estate to be given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as the latter had taken care of the deceased prior to his passing. There was no reason to doubt this piece of evidence which was also spoken of by the plaintiff and his mother and which transpired a few days after the passing of the deceased. It would be odd to have the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant provided for from the estate of the deceased when this was not in the Malaysian will. There are many possible reasons why the Malaysian will does not provide for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. One is that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was promised a sum of money by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and possibly the latter’s husband if the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would claim that such a will existed which would leave everything to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s children without drawing attention to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have wanted to distance herself from the Malaysian will which would at some point have to surface if it were to govern distribution of the deceased’s estate as she knew her siblings would be suspicious. By having the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant stated as the executor and trustee while enabling the only beneficiaries to be the children of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant prevented any attack or suspicion of the motives of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The question remains - was the will in fact a forged document? I found that the Malaysian will was in all probability a product of an attempt to deny the children of the deceased an equal share in the estate of the deceased and was not executed by the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The evidence of the two witnesses to the will was rife with irregularities and inconsistencies. The Malaysian lawyer claimed he had handled many legal matters for the deceased whom he had known for decades. He described the relationship between the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as close.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He went on to inform that the deceased executed the Malaysian will with the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant present and that the deceased signed with him and another individual as witnesses. This second witness he first described as a “Malay guy” and only later when prodded during cross-examination, as a former driver of the deceased. In his affidavit, he claimed that he informed the plaintiff of the second witness but in court under cross-examination, he claimed that he did not tell the plaintiff who the witnesses of the Malaysian will were. There was no reason why he would not have if a will was executed. Under cross-examination he eventually confirmed that his affidavit was correct and that he did tell the plaintiff about the witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Malaysian lawyer went on to say that “<em>my former client informed me that he wanted to impress his thumbprint on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will as well</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It was the plaintiff’s case that the deceased never used his thumbprint on documents. No document other than the Malaysian will was produced to show that the deceased had a pattern of affixing his thumbprint together with his signature. The Malaysian lawyer who had apparently acted for him on various legal matters over the years did not ask why the deceased felt the need to do this. The plaintiff had given in evidence that he had seen the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant removing the cloth that was placed over the deceased’s body during the wake and on being asked why, she tried to distract from this. It was the suggestion of the plaintiff therefore that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may have used the thumbprint of the deceased as he lay dead, on this Malaysian will. While truth may sometimes be stranger than fiction, I found no evidence to corroborate this. An attempt to forensically examine the thumbprint did not point to any conclusion. I did accept however that it was unusual that the deceased would have affixed his thumbprint on the Malaysian will when this was not his practice. More relevant is the fact that this was not done for the Singapore will 7 months before the Malaysian will nor the insurance forms which was signed 9 months after the Malaysian will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was of concern in another material way. He claimed to have been asked by the deceased to prepare his will. It is unclear whether the lawyer informed him of the need for a second witness or if it was the deceased himself who decided on bringing his driver to be his witness. The lawyer claimed to have prepared the will. Yet he did not have a copy of it when asked by the plaintiff for it. He stated that he gave both the original signed will and a copy, to the deceased. The Malaysian lawyer was not merely a witness to the execution of the will. In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> v <b><em>The Bank of East Asia Ltd</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> the lack of notes or retention of a copy of a will were not seen as detrimental if the lawyer was only a witness. It is certainly different if he prepared the will in his professional capacity. This may of course be a lapse in professional judgment but one of the reasons the lawyer gave in evidence for the deceased having approached him instead of a lawyer in Singapore was that it was cheaper to get it done in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He knew he was acting in his professional capacity and what his duties were given his vast experience in matters of this nature. No good reason was offered for not having kept a copy of a will drafted by him as a lawyer. Unlike the Singapore will, it was also not registered at a wills registry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     When pressed by the plaintiff for a copy of the will on 6 November 2019, the Malaysian lawyer provided an unsigned copy to the plaintiff saying that he managed to get that from a saved soft copy. It was the plaintiff’s evidence that the Malaysian lawyer told him that the deceased did attend at his office but never signed the will. Given that there was no signed copy retained, this was probable. It was also the evidence of the plaintiff that the lawyer informed him that cultural norms dictated that the only son of the deceased should inherit the estate and that if he wanted to, he could take steps to have that done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> This astonishing evidence if true has far reaching professional consequences for the lawyer. What is clear however is that no signed copy of the Malaysian will was retained by the Malaysian lawyer. The evidence of the plaintiff that he was informed by the Malaysian lawyer that S$25 000 was owed to him by the deceased for corporate taxes seems to find support in the evidence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant herself who said she approached the lawyer’s office on 13 November 2019 (after she came to know of the existence of the Malaysian will) as she was informed that there were tax in arrears as well as another debt that their father owed. There is also evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had wanted payments to be made to the Malaysian lawyer towards taxes in arrears.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian lawyer’s motive is unclear but the evidence of the plaintiff was compelling in its suggestion that the Malaysian lawyer conducted his matters in a rather casual way, without proper records. Even his answers to questions in court were rather insouciant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness in the larger context of the Malaysian lawyer’s evidence was troubling as well. He claimed to have met the deceased in Malaysia when he was out of work. He was employed by the deceased as his driver. He worked for the deceased for about a year. Thereafter, he left to work in Singapore for about 2 years and claimed to have worked for the deceased again in early 2017. He was not clear of which month in 2017 he ceased employment. He stated that he had driven the deceased and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to the Malaysian lawyer’s office on many occasions. Under cross-examination, when asked who prepared his affidavit, he stated that it was the Malaysian lawyer. When asked to clarify whether he dictated the contents to the Malaysian lawyer, he said that it was in fact completely prepared by the lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer and that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will are very similar. Given that the witnesses to the Malaysian will were both called to give evidence, the drafting of the affidavit by the Malaysian lawyer for the second witness was inappropriate. The second witness under cross-examination, was also unable to identify the ex-wife and the children of the deceased accurately but insisted in his affidavit that he was told by the deceased that the plaintiff and his younger daughter were greedy, and that his grandsons of his older daughter “deserved” to inherit his estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>Such remarks crafted by the Malaysian lawyer and not coming from the witness himself was troubling. I noted as well that he had broken down in tears when asked about the will. He seemed very nervous which can be expected in court proceedings, but the degree of his anxiety in answering the question of whether he witnessed the execution of the will by the deceased was concerning. He claimed that he was just emotional thinking of the deceased who was like a father to him. This however, together with the parroting of evidence of the Malaysian lawyer in his affidavit especially when he is not fluent in English throws up concerns about the truthfulness of what was being said. It bears repeating that it was the evidence of the new driver who started to work for the deceased sometime in 2017 as well that he had never been asked to drive the deceased to the Malaysian lawyer’s office. This was at odds with the evidence of the Malaysian lawyer that the deceased approached the lawyer for many matters over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(ii) Evidence and conduct of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is somewhat incongruent with human nature for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was surprised on being told by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that there was a Malaysian will, not to have asked more about it nor about the contents. This is so given that the defendants were close, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was months ago seated in a Singapore law office aware that her father wanted her to be the executor of his will. Upon finally receiving the Malaysian will from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, she did not share it with her birth family knowing that they were no longer beneficiaries. Even if she were not curious and resisted the temptation of finding out if she was to benefit from the Malaysian will just as she was to have benefitted from the Singapore will, why did she not take immediate steps to be transparent with her mother and siblings upon finding out about the Malaysian will? It did not occur to her somewhat odd as well that despite her consistent evidence of being in a very close relationship with her father, she was so quickly removed as the executor of the Malaysian will. Even when she met her mother and the plaintiff on a flight to India by chance, she showed a picture of the will that appeared on her mobile phone and not the details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     While she knew that the Singapore will had apparently been superseded by the Malaysian will, she chose to apply for probate in Singapore based on the Singapore will. The application has been granted but the grant has not been issued. It was the plaintiff and his younger sister’s position that she had not done so as her demands for payment to be made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not agreed to by them nor their mother. This appears to have prompted her to stop the Singapore proceedings. I do not accept that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant chose not to extract the order simply because she was suddenly of the view that she should honour the later Malaysian will and no longer felt any pressure by her siblings to accept the Singapore will. Her insistence as well that she would gain nothing from the Malaysian will was to draw an artificial line between gaining directly from her father’s estate and indirectly through her children. The plaintiff’s insistence that the Malaysian will be forwarded for handwriting analysis made relations strained. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she felt pressured to apply for probate on the Singapore will is hard to appreciate because she had legal counsel, and she did not feel similar pressure when she eventually aborted the proceedings. It was in fact the Singapore lawyer’s evidence that he was not informed of a Malaysian will. On being told that, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant changed her initial position on having told her counsel of this to the position that he only knew there were Malaysian properties, and she was told that she could proceed to do the needful in Malaysia after getting probate in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s position that she was very close to the deceased, especially having taken care of him in her house for a period, while the plaintiff was not. From the evidence collectively it appeared that the deceased’s relationship with his ex-wife and all his children had its challenges at times. I could not find any evidence that he was close to one child to the exclusion of the others. In any event, who he chose to leave his wealth to may have nothing to do with whether he was close to an individual or not. If that were the case, he would have likely left something for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant went on to say that the deceased was also very close to her sons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> suggesting that it should not surprise anyone in the family that her father left his estate to them. What is of significance is that although she never knew the existence of the will until after the deceased had passed on nor was she curious about its contents when first told, she stated in her affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…<em>my father impressed his signature on the 28 December 2017 Malaysia will to avoid any ambiguity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In my view, her position that the deceased must have done so to avoid ambiguity is not something a person absent at the execution would be able to categorically say. Unless of course, she knew this from those who were present. Yet she claims that even her close friend, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant simply told her about the existence of the will in the month after the passing of the deceased. Further, why would there be a need to be concerned about ambiguity given that there were 2 witnesses? The Singapore will executed 7 months prior did not have a thumbprint and the deceased never executed documents this way in the past. Any position that his hands were weak and may tremble on writing was not accepted considering the history of the way the deceased acted and very specifically, the fact that he had signed on insurance documents in 2018 without the need to affix his thumbprint. These documents were handed to the plaintiff by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant when the plaintiff arrived at the deceased’s home after the latter’s passing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The defendants’ counsel submitted that the issue of the thumbprint was raised by the plaintiff only in their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1), thereby causing prejudice to the defendants and would need to be treated as fatal to the plaintiff’s case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The reference in the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) was clearly in reply to paragraph 46 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) which referred to the thumbprint having been affixed to “<em>avoid any debate as to the validity of the will</em>”. In any event, the defendants’ case cannot be said to have been prejudiced as leave of court to address this could have been sought if felt to be material. What is clear is that as a matter of practice, the deceased never affixed his thumbprint, and this formed the roots of the plaintiff’s position on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reliance on forensic handwriting analysis – to what extent?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With advancements in technology, the contribution of experts in handwriting analysis has been very helpful in the determination of many issues before the courts, be it criminal, civil or family matters. And much like any other science, there is often conflict in opinion. It is the responsibility of a court where there is such conflict to decide if the methodologies and equipment used has produced a more robust and hence more reliable conclusion by one expert as compared to another. In some cases, of course, both may be limited such that it would be safer to turn to evidence other than the conclusions drawn by the expert witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The plaintiff called on an expert who has about 23 years of experience and has given evidence in many trials prior to this one. He was provided a copy of the Malaysian will where 2 signatures (Q1 and Q2) are found. He was also given 3 specimens (S1-S3) which he did not consider to be good specimen as they contained signatures that were made by the deceased in 2013. He informed in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> that signatures done many years ago would not provide for a fair comparison. He went on to compare Q1 and Q2 with the signature of the deceased found on the insurance forms which sought disability benefits. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant appears to have filled out this form for the deceased. This specimen (S4-1 to S4-5) were signed on 1 September 2018 (i.e. 9 months after the Malaysian will of December 2017). As mentioned previously, this specimen also does not bear the thumbprint of the deceased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Having highlighted the similarities in the signatures found on the Malaysian will and the specimen document S4 which he pointed out showed a moderate range of variation, he went on to elaborate on the significant differences which lent to his conclusion that there is “strong support” that the person who signed on Q1 and Q2 <b>is not</b> the same person who signed on S4.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> One of the limitations under which the expert worked however is the fact that only a copy of the Malaysian will was handed to the expert. This prevented stereomicroscopic comparative examination of the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     After his evidence was given, the defendants’ counsel called on an expert. The decision to call this expert came after hearing dates were taken which impacted to some degree, the preparation of the plaintiff’s case. I allowed the application regardless but allowed the plaintiff’s expert a right to respond. The defendants’ expert has 40 years of experience and similarly, has experience in giving evidence in court proceedings. This expert had the benefit of the original Malaysian will, the specimens S1 to S4 and the Singapore will (S5).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     She opined that the signatures in 2017 and 2018, the wills and the insurance company forms, respectively <em>“showed unsteady pen movement and angular and less fluently made curves</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> She also stated that signatures that were made on the same day also showed significant inconsistencies. She put it down to natural variation. She also gave in evidence that Q1 and Q2 showed no hesitation and stiffness in pen movement and no laboured drawing and re-touching of strokes which are associated with manual copying or stimulations. She was of the view that no tracing had been done.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> She compared S4 (just as the plaintiff’s expert did) and S5 (the Singapore will) with Q1 and Q2. She commented that the design, size, pen movement and stroke fluency were similar to the natural variation in S4 and S5. In other words, I must first accept that the variations seen in the specimen documents are natural variations. I had no reason to doubt it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The expert for the defendants believed the deceased “<b>probably” signed</b> the Malaysian will. This is a conclusion that is less than certain. In the range of certainty, the highest certainty levels would be if the signatures in Q1 and Q 2 are referred to as “is written by” or “it is highly probable written by”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The expert also made a few observations about the analysis of the plaintiff’s expert. She pointed out what was already expressed as a limitation by the plaintiff’s expert, that is, that the original Malaysian will was not provided. She then went on to disagree with the description of a particular slant that appeared on the signatures in S4-5. She further disagreed with the plaintiff’s expert that there was a clear “pen lift” in Q2. She made in my view unfortunately, a comment on the plaintiff’s expert’s carelessness in that there were typographical errors, a wrongly labelled image and wrong paragraphing in his report<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> which I do not believe reduces the weight that can be attributed to his core work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given that the defendants called on their witness late in the day, I gave the opportunity for the plaintiff’s expert to file a supplementary affidavit after examining the original Malaysian will and the Singapore will. He was able to conduct a stereomicroscopic comparative examination. He concluded again that the <b>author of the questioned documents was not the author of the specimens in S4 and S5</b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The affidavit of another handwriting analyst engaged by the plaintiff and who resides in India was filed. He did not attend proceedings and was not subject to cross-examination and hence I ascribed no value to the same. He shared the opinion of the expert of the plaintiff who did attend these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given that the core issue in this case was the validity of the Malaysian will, parties were encouraged during a case conference to consider jointly engaging an expert to analyse the signatures on the Malaysian will with the hope that matters would then be resolved amicably. Much disagreement arose on the scope of the engagement for the analysis to be done by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). When parties finally agreed and a report appears to have been produced, the plaintiff chose not to rely on it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Section 116 (g) of the Evidence Act (1893) provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>“<em>The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks is likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>By way of illustration the section provides that the court can presume that evidence which could be produced but is not would if produced have been unfavourable to the person who withholds it. Relying on the legislative provision and referring to the case of <b><em>Harmony Shipping CO.S.A</em></b><b>.</b> v. <b><em>Saudi Europe Line Ltd</em></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> the defendants’ counsel urged the court to accept that the HSA report was unfavourable to the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The court in <b><em>Harmony Shipping</em></b> however was referring generally to witnesses of fact and the rule that there is no property in a witness. The defendants were invited to consider applying for the production of the HSA report but during a case conference on 2 May 2023, the defendants’ counsel had confirmed that his clients did not intend to seek production of the report. Further, even as the defendants’ were of the view that the plaintiff was “expert shopping” in relying on the report that was in fact produced and omitting the HSA report, they did essentially the same by calling on their expert so close to the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In the case of <b><em>Sudha Natrajan</em></b> the court was of the view that it should not speculate on what any withheld evidence may contain or be. What then were the circumstances in the case before me which prevented an adverse inference? Litigation privilege is one of 2 aspects of legal professional privilege, the other being legal advice privilege. The plaintiff relied on litigation privilege by satisfying the court that there had been a reasonable prospect of litigation, and the communications/document were for the dominant purpose of litigation. Litigation privilege applies to expert witnesses. The defendants were additionally not prejudiced by the omission to produce the report. The 2 reports, from qualified local experts with sound knowledge and utilisation of accepted methods of analysis were in conflict, highlighting the tremendous challenge in relying on handwriting analysis in this case. In any event, as stated above, there was nothing limiting the defendants from applying to produce the HSA report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In light of the fact that the reports that were submitted to court contained differing conclusions and given especially that the experts themselves could not categorise their conclusions with the highest certainty level, I chose to look at all the other evidence instead of relying on the handwriting analysis in making my determination. While handwriting analysis as a growing science is certainly helpful, it remains equally very much an art allowing for different interpretations of the same documents. In some cases, like this one, it would in my view be unsafe to select one over the other in deciding the central issue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Why the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was allowed to continue as executor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having found that the Singapore will was the last valid will, I considered the application by the plaintiff for letters of administration (with will annexed) to be granted to him or in the alternative, for an amendment to the grant appointing the plaintiff instead of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the executor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The alternative prayer was not feasible given that the Singapore will provide only specific situations where substitution could occur and none of the events had transpired. The closest reference to enable substitution was in the event the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant could not take care of “her” affairs as distinct from the estate affairs. Even if the request is based on the position that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is unfit to act as executor, the court cannot go beyond the intentions of the testator. Further, there can be no amendment to the grant of probate as no grant has been made. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant aborted proceedings once an order in terms of the application had been obtained, short of the actual grant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I also dismissed the application by the plaintiff to apply for letters of administration (with will annexed). While there is in my view sufficient evidence to conclude that the deceased could not have executed the Malaysian will, I could not conclude with a high level of certainty as to the extent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s involvement in this. While there was clearly evidence that she knew of the existence of the Malaysian will, the level of her culpability or knowledge that the deceased never properly executed the Malaysian will would require some conjecture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s application for probate in Singapore, the order has been made. Further, the assets of the deceased are known, and the matter can be completed quickly enabling the shares of the beneficiaries to be received. It was the plaintiff’s submission<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> that since the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had proceeded to apply for a grant seeking to propound the Singapore will when she knew of the Malaysian will and had breached her fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, she should be removed as executor with the plaintiff stepping in instead. The reference to s 32 of the Probate and Administration Act (1934)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> would be misplaced as a grant has not yet been made. Section 32 refers to the revocation of grants and not setting aside orders made, as is the case here. Additionally, both executors and trustees owe fiduciary duties to beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate in relation to the administration of his estate. An executor essentially “calls in the estate” and ensures that the assets are converted into cash and pays off all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When he has done that, his duties as an executor are discharged. As she moves to fill in the shoes of a trustee, he owes a set of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries including the important duty of keeping and providing accounts to the beneficiaries (<b><em>Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another</em></b> v <b><em>Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff and his younger sister can hold the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant accountable for the proper administration of the estate including the duty to account which is a continuing one. There has yet to be a grant of probate – once issued, this would usher in the duties of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as executor and trustee. There is no need to unwind the steps already taken in these proceedings given the ability of the beneficiaries to monitor and insist that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant remain accountable to them as the person their father trusted to execute his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The outcome of this litigation was in the plaintiff’s favour. Essentially the plaintiff had been successful in proving that the last valid will of his father was the one executed in Singapore. The fact that I did not enable him to take over the administration of the estate from his sister does not make him the unsuccessful party. The central issue was determined in his favour and he should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Costs are in the discretion of the court and reference was made to Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (2021). I gave parties ample time to agree on costs, but they were unable to do so. The hearing took 6 days. Despite numerous case conferences before the matter was fixed, the defendants chose to indicate that they wished to call an expert handwriting analyst some 10 days before the commencement of the hearing, having already known of the nature of the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert. The matter was not simple and there were many witnesses of fact called by the plaintiff to provide evidence. A cost order reflective of the complexity and effort expended was necessary. The sum of $90 000 (all in) was felt to be a fair amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I ordered that the defendants be jointly and severally responsible for the costs as they participated in material albeit different ways to this litigation, which certainly could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this case, family members knew that a will had been left by their father to govern the distribution of his estate on his passing. Any information that is known by one or more persons that there may be yet another later will must be shared regardless of any concern about how it would be received or accepted. Any lack of transparency does not lend trust as to its authenticity. It also fuels frustration, disappointment, anger and unnecessary costs fighting each other in a courtroom. The money that these parties fought over was never money that was theirs in the first place. It was a gift. It was never to have them destroy relationships but to instead come together in their father’s memory with an even stronger tone to their relationships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The defendants were not honest and transparent in their dealings with the plaintiff and the larger family and it has occasioned this litigation and caused a great rift between them. Family in probate proceedings should be mindful of the unnecessary burden they place on generations after them from disputes of this nature.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 196 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22704-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 2</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Affidavit of 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant dated 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 39.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 28 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcripts (Day 3) at pages 227 to 229, 232 to 234 and (Day 4) at pages 204 to 207.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 29 of the sister’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 20 of the plaintiff’s aunt’s affidavit of 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>For clarity this is not the same driver who acted as a second witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 23 of affidavit of the Malaysian lawyer dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 70 of affidavit of 20 April 2022 and Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 260-261.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Ibid. at paragraph 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19733-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 66</a>.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Certified Transcript (Day 3) at pages 197, 20-221.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of the affidavit of the plaintiff dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Paragraphs 178-179 of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit of 20 April 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Transcript (Day 4) at page 11, lines 8 to 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Paragraphs 26-28 of the affidavit dated 20 April 2022 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> witness to the Malaysian will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>Certified transcript (Day 2) pages 13 to 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Paragraph 94 of 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s affidavit dated 20 April 2022.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>Ibid.at paragraph 137.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>Paragraph 59 of defendants’ submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>Fancini, Simone Ling, “Expert Handwriting Testimony: Is the Writing Really on the Wall?” 11 Suffolk J.

My decision in respect of SUM 1739 and SUM 1684, which were the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, can be found in <em>WZH v WZI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31841-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 48</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Husband argues that there should be no order as to costs The broad thrust of his argument is that if one proceeds on the well-established rule that costs should follow the event, although the Wife may be entitled to costs in SUM 1739, the Husband should be entitled to costs of SUM 1684. The costs ordered in either application would offset each other – effectively, there would be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, argued that because the Wife had succeeded in obtaining orders for discovery, she should be entitled to costs. In doing so, counsel for the Wife relies on the starting position that costs should follow the event. Counsel for the Wife further argues that there are no facts which warrant a departure from this starting point. In fact, they say that the Husband’s conduct further justifies why he should be ordered to bear costs. In particular, counsel for the Wife highlights that the Husband had unreasonably denied their requests for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for the Wife’s application for interrogatories, counsel for the Wife appears to take the position, though they do not explicitly say so, that if one applies the rule the costs follow the event, it is the Husband who should be entitled to costs because the Wife had only obtained orders in respect of one part of the four interrogatories which she had sought. That said, the Husband’s conduct justifies departing from the starting point – this is because the Husband had unreasonably refused to answer the voluntary interrogatories which the Wife had posed to him. The end result is that the Husband should also be ordered to pay the Wife costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As to the quantum of costs, counsel for the Wife submitted that costs for both applications should be fixed at $3815 ($3500 as legal costs and $315 as GST).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The starting point insofar as costs are concerned, is that costs should indeed follow the event. The Wife has succeeded in her application for discovery in SUM 1739. She should therefore be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As for the quantum of such costs, I considered the fact that the application for discovery only concerned one item and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also considered the reasonableness of the Husband’s objections to the Wife’s requests for these documents at the voluntary disclosure stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband had resisted disclosure on the basis that the request was not relevant, necessary or reasonable for the fair disposal of the ancillary matters, and that the Wife’s requests were: a) broad and oppressive and amounted to fishing and b) that she had not provided any adequate reason to justify the documents requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s objections must be viewed in light of the Wife’s request. In her request dated 6 March 2024, she states that these documents relate to the Husband’s “means, earning capacity, the pool of matrimonial assets and dissipation of matrimonial assets”. It is clear, from this, that she had indeed provided adequate reasons for seeking those documents. It is also clear, from the Wife’s request, how these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, specifically, the issue of whether matrimonial assets had been dissipated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It is therefore apparent to me that these documents could have been disclosed earlier. This is especially since the Husband did not object to their production on the basis that he did not have the documents sought.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Costs of SUM 1739 are therefore fixed at fixed at $900 (all in), to be paid by the Husband, to the Wife, by 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As for SUM 1684 which was the Wife’s application for interrogatories, given that Wife was only successful in respect of Item 4(a), it cannot be said that she was the successful party in respect of SUM 1684. The Husband is thus entitled to costs of SUM 1684.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     There was, in my judgment, no reason to depart from the general principle that costs should follow the event. I do not find that the Husband had acted unreasonably in resisting the request. As I had found, in my substantive decision in respect of SUM 1684, the Wife’s quarrel with his answers went to the truth of those answers rather than their sufficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As to the quantum of costs, I considered that SUM 1684 involved four items, and did not involve any particularly complex issues of law or fact. I also considered the conduct of parties. It was clear to me, from reading the Husband’s answers to the interrogatories posed, that he had provided sufficient answers. As I have mentioned above, the Wife’s basis for taking out SUM 1684 was that she disputed the truth of the Husband’s answers. But that is not the purpose of the interrogatory process (see <em>eg</em>; Rule 70 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Costs of SUM 1684 are therefore fixed at $975 (all-in), to be paid by the Wife, to the Husband, by 30 August 2024.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 1739 at p 34 and 145.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Leave to file further affidavits"],"date":"2024-07-22","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)","title":"XAD v XAE","citation":"[2024] SGFC 54","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31851-SSP.xml","counsel":["Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-08-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XAD v XAE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XAD <em>v</em> XAE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31851-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 54</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">OSG 163 of 2023 (Summons No 1664 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">22 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Daniel Loh Weijie, Jacob Lee Sheng Hui and M Nareindharan (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; Ryan Yu Gen Xian (Aspect Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XAD — XAE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Leave to file further affidavits</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">22 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Husband is a Thai national, and the Wife, a Singaporean. They were married on 2 November 2015 in Thailand. They welcomed two daughters, [A] and [B], into their family. Relations between Husband and Wife were strained and bitter. That was evident to me from the matters narrated in the respective affidavits filed by each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The present dispute stems from the Husband’s claim that the Wife had wrongfully removed the younger daughter, [A], from her place of habitual residence in Thailand in May 2023. In response, the Husband took out an application in FC/OSG 163/2023 (“OSG 163”) on 15 November 2023, seeking custody, care and control of [A], and an order that she be returned to Thailand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       As with all originating summons that are filed, the Husband filed his affidavit in support of OSG 163. The Wife filed a reply affidavit. The Husband has now taken out an application in SUM 1664/2024 (“SUM 1664”) seeking leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 12 July 2024. This is my decision in respect of SUM 1664.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable legal principles governing when leave would be granted to file a further affidavit</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Parties disputed the applicable legal principles which governed the granting of leave to file a further affidavit. At the hearing before me, and in their written submissions, parties strenuously argued that a different legal test should apply. I have summarised the essence of their respective arguments below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Daniel Loh (“Mr Loh”) argued that the starting point was that a litigant should be allowed to put all relevant evidence before the court. The court should err on the side of caution in assessing the relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced by way of a further affidavit – if there was any doubt as to the relevancy of the evidence, it would be best to simply allow the evidence to be adduced. After all, the main concern at the interlocutory stage was to ensure that all the relevant evidence was placed before the judge hearing the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Ryan Yu (“Mr Yu”), disagreed with the applicable legal principles as had been framed by Mr Loh. He argued that there were three cumulative requirements which had to be fulfilled before leave to file a further affidavit would be granted. First, the party seeking leave to file a further affidavit had to show that there were new matters that they wished to respond to. Second, if there were such new matters, one must consider whether the party seeking leave could have responded to those matters at the time which they filed their first affidavit. Third, one must also consider whether the matters which were now being raised were relevant to the disposition of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In determining whether leave should be granted to a party to file a further affidavit, Rule 508 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 is relevant. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Supporting affidavits</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>508.—(1</b>)     <b>Unless otherwise provided in any written law, a plaintiff who intends to adduce evidence in support of an originating summons must do so by affidavit.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The plaintiff must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on every defendant not later than 7 days after the service of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Unless otherwise provided in any written law, in the case of an <em>ex parte</em> originating summons, the applicant must file a supporting affidavit or affidavits at the time of filing of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The defendant who intends to adduce evidence with reference to the originating summons served on him must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The defendant must file the affidavit or affidavits and serve a copy on the plaintiff not later than 21 days after being served with a copy of the plaintiff’s affidavit or affidavits under paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<b>6</b>)     <b>No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 508 is identical to Order 28 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court 2014. It provides the manner in which evidence is to be adduced where an originating summons is taken out. The rules clearly provide that the applicant must file an affidavit in support of their application, and that the respondent, if they intend to adduce evidence in response, must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is therefore clear to me that the rules contemplate that both the applicant, as well as the respondent, are only entitled to file a single affidavit each – unless, of course, the court grants them leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There are good reasons for this. The absence of a hard limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed could well encourage parties to keep exchanging salvoes via affidavit thereby preventing the matter from proceeding to a hearing: see <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> at [69].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There are, of course, cases where affidavit evidence may simply be insufficient to deal with the matter. In such cases, the court has the power to order that the matter continue as though it had been begun by way of writ, and that pleadings be filed, or that any affidavits which had been filed to stand as pleadings: Rule 512 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     While there is a limit on the number of affidavits that can be filed in the context of an originating summons, this is not cast in stone. The reason for this lies in the general right of a litigant to bring all available evidence before the court. As was noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0110.xml')\">[2010] 3 SLR 110</a> (“<em>Basil Anthony</em>”), which had been cited by Mr Loh in his written submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The right of a litigant to bring relevant evidence before the court</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24    At this juncture, we would emphasise that every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence relevant to his or her case to the attention of the court. <b>This general right is so fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in support of it; in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive decision or rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial approach to fact-finding.</b> The importance of the right is reflected in the fact that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to compel, on the pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to give relevant evidence, to come forward and give it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25     <b>The general right is, of course, subject to specific limits.</b> For present purposes, the following limits are germane. A litigant only has the right to adduce relevant evidence, as defined by the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and other applicable rules; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be considered by the court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as practicable, take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose is to ensure the fair, economical, swift and orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or collateral motives in an abusive or oppressive manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26    In striking the proper balance between the general right and the specific limits, a trial judge must not only be guided by the applicable rules and decisions, but must look beyond the mechanical application of these rules and decisions, and carefully assess the interests at stake in every case to ensure that a fair outcome is reached through the application of fair processes. It should always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow from the wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful, we are of the view that it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion. With specific regard to the calling of witnesses, we would reiterate what was said in <em>Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services v Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0427.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 427</a> (at [17]), where this court allowed an appeal to introduce eleven new witnesses of fact after the summons for directions stage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules and the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary to establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to be adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before the court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If, however, it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is unnecessary, irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control and is in a position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the witness and/or by an order as to costs. It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the court is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by a strict adherence to the rules of civil procedure. [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In <em>Basil Anthony</em>, the appellant had taken issue with the trial judge’s decision to set aside his subpoenas to witnesses which he had intended to call. On appeal, the CA ordered a retrial on the basis that the appellant should have been allowed to subpoena those witnesses as they were in a position to give evidence on the key events on which the outcome of the case turned: <em>Basil Anthony</em> at [50] – [57]. It was in that context that the CA had made those observations on a litigant’s right to bring all evidence before the court, subject, of course, to any limits imposed by law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     This general rule, that a litigant is entitled to put all relevant evidence before the court is equally applicable in the context of an originating summons. The Rules do allow a litigant to file a further affidavit, on the condition that leave of court is obtained: Rule 508(6) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The decision as to whether leave should be granted is a matter of discretion. In deciding whether leave should be granted, one factor which the court will consider is whether the further evidence sought to be adduced is relevant to the disposal of the matter. In other words, the evidence canvassed in the further affidavit must have some discernible nexus to the issues in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Naturally, in assessing the relevance of the further evidence sought to be adduced, one must also consider the issues in dispute. OSG 163 was an application taken out under s 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934. In that vein, s 3 of the GIA provides that the welfare of the infant is to be the paramount consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In assessing what is in the infant’s welfare, the court will consider factors such as the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, the child’s relationship with each parent and the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents: <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22083-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 49</a> at [51] – [52]; <em>VGK v VGL and VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24205-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 25</a> at [38] – [39]. In doing so, close attention must be paid to all the facts and circumstances of the case: see <em>e.g. AWN v AWO and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0228.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 228</a> at [4]; <em>UMF v UMG and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22974-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 640</a> at [39] – [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given the fact-sensitive nature of this exercise, I agree with Mr Loh’s point that at the interlocutory stage, one should take a broad view as to the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced. I would emphasise, however, that parties should still carefully consider the evidence that they are seeking to adduce – they must ask themselves whether such evidence is <em>necessary</em> to the disposal of the matter. That the court takes a broad view as to the relevance of the evidence is not a free pass for parties to file voluminous affidavits containing evidence that is not necessary to the disposal of the case. In such a situation, adverse costs orders may be made on the basis that that party has taken an unreasonable stance in the proceedings, and that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [9] citing <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In summary, these are the principles which I apply to determine whether leave should be granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit in OSG 163. For clarity, these principles which I have articulated should not be construed as bright-line rules.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, where originating applications are concerned, evidence is adduced by way of affidavit, and both the applicant as well as the respondent, are entitled by the Rules under the FJR, to file one affidavit each. That said, litigants have a <em>general</em> right to bring all available evidence before the court – and so, the court can, as provided for by Rule 508(6), grant a party leave to file a further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As to whether leave should be granted, the court will consider the relevance of the evidence in the further affidavit. In the context of child guardianship applications, given the fact-sensitive exercise of determining what is in the infant’s welfare, the court would take a broad view in assessing the relevancy of the further evidence sought to be adduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties must bear in mind whether the evidence is indeed necessary to the disposal of the case, and any unreasonable conduct such as the filing of voluminous affidavits may well be dealt with by way of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband should be granted leave to file a further affidavit </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband exhibited a draft of the further affidavit which he sought leave to file. It contained three distinct parts. The first part (paragraphs 7 – 78) dealt with the following events which took place after OSG 163 had been filed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Divorce proceedings in Thailand dealing with the custody of the children. During the hearing, Mr Loh informed me that these divorce proceedings had recently concluded, after the Husband had sought leave to file a further affidavit in SUM 1664. There was therefore nothing in the draft affidavit disclosing the conclusion of those divorce proceedings, nor was there any evidence exhibited as to any orders made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Attempts by parties to settle OSG 163 amicably. The Husband sets out the chronology of negotiations with the Wife by which they attempted to settle matters. According to the Husband, the Wife had initially agreed to return [A] to him. However, after some four months of toing and froing, the Husband realised that the Wife was dragging her feet over the matter in a bid to delay the hearing of OSG 163 and to further alienate [A] from him, as well as her sister, [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 January 2024, the Wife withdrew her application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Husband. That the Wife withdrew the application, according to the Husband, demonstrates that her allegations that he had committed family violence was without merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Refusal to renew the elder daughter’s ([B]’s) passport. The Husband had instructed his lawyers to send a letter to the Wife’s lawyers. That letter claimed that the Wife had unreasonably failed to cooperate regarding the renewal of the eldest daughter’s passport. This meant that [B] was unable to travel during the Songkram festival (Thailand’s New Year public holiday).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The “Roblox incident”. The Husband explained that he would play games on Roblox with both his daughters. He explained this made them feel as though they were a family. On the morning of 8 April 2024, out of the blue, he received a phone call from [A] who told him, whilst sobbing between words, that she did not want to go back to Thailand. The Husband later discovered that this phone call had been recorded. He believes that the Wife had orchestrated the entire episode. Later that very day, at noon, the Husband logged back onto Roblox only to discover that he had been deleted as a friend on [A]’s friend list, and was blocked from adding [A] back as a friend. Apart from this incident on the 8<sup>th</sup> of April 2024, the Husband also details other incidents that took place over the Roblox application which, according to him, demonstrate that the Wife has been attempting to alienate [A]from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The second part of the Husband’s draft affidavit (at paragraphs 79 – 109) sets out his replies to the fresh allegations of fact which the Wife had raised in her reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The third part of the draft affidavit (at paragraphs 111 to 124) sets out the Husband’s reply to paragraphs 86 – 133 of the Wife’s reply affidavit. Mr Loh points out that these paragraphs in the Wife’s reply affidavit are not in response to anything which the Husband had said in his supporting affidavit for OSG 163. In any event, as Mr Loh explains, these paragraphs of the Wife’s reply affidavit set out fresh allegations which the Husband has not had the opportunity to respond to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As to the events set out in the first part of the Husband’s draft affidavit, there can, in my judgment, be no quarrel that they are relevant to OSG 163. The events which had been set out (above at [21]) paint a fuller picture of the family dynamics, as well as the relationship between the child and the parents, and whether there could possibly be any safety concerns on the part of [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for the second and third parts of the draft affidavits, I am also satisfied that the matters disclosed therein are also relevant to the disposal of OSG 163. In particular, the matters disclosed by the Husband in the draft affidavit are relevant to determining whether there has indeed been parental alienation as well as what would be in [A]’s best interests (<em>ie</em>, whether she should be educated in Singapore or Thailand) – these are issues which have a direct bearing on the determination of OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Leave is therefore granted to the Husband to file a further affidavit. As a final point, I add that I have taken a liberal approach to assessing the relevancy of the evidence raised, especially considering that the nature of the assessment undertaken by the judge hearing OSG 163 is necessarily a fact-sensitive one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In addition to granting the Husband leave to file the further affidavit, I also order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The further affidavit should also state whether the divorce proceedings in Thailand had been concluded and what orders had been made by the Thai court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s further affidavit is to be filed and served no later than the 29<sup>th</sup> of July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The costs of SUM 1664 shall be reserved to the judge hearing OSG 163. I do so because while I have taken the view that the matters raised in the further affidavit are relevant to the issues in OSG 163, I make no finding or comment as to whether they are necessary to the disposition of the case. The necessity of the evidence sought to be adduced in the further affidavit could, as I have explained above (at [19]), have a bearing on costs. That is, in my judgment, a matter best assessed by the judge hearing the substantive application. In that vein, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing OSG 163.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Loh and Mr Yu for their able assistance and their well-written submissions.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s draft affidavit at paras 52 – 54.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary matters – Division of matrimonial assets"],"date":"2024-07-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce 113 of 2022","title":"WZV v WZW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 52","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31843-SSP.xml","counsel":["Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife","Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband."],"timestamp":"2024-08-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Darryl Soh","html":"<root><head><title>WZV v WZW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZV <em>v</em> WZW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31843-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 52</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce 113 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Darryl Soh </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Paul (M/s Cross Street Chambers) for the Wife; Tan Wei Chieh (M/s Prestige Legal LLP) for the Husband. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZV — WZW </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Darryl Soh:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). By consent, the Parties agreed for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of the marriage, with supervised access to the Husband. The Parties could not however agree on the financial and children’s custody orders. In respect of the division of matrimonial assets, the Parties disagreed on the satisfaction of the Wife’s personal liabilities from the pool of matrimonial assets and the indirect contributions ratio to be ascribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 17 April 2024, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children, for the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total monthly children’s maintenance of $890.00. The Husband was dissatisfied with the orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets and filed a Notice of Appeal on 24 April 2024. In these grounds, I explain my decision on the division of matrimonial assets in greater detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties are in their 40s and they were married in 2004 after they first met as colleagues. The Husband is presently employed in the security industry and the Wife is in an administrative role. After they were married, they temporarily resided in the home of the Husband’s parents. The Parties subsequently purchased their matrimonial home (“Matrimonial Home”) a year later and they moved into it together with the Husband’s family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Parties are blessed with two children, both of whom are in or around their teenage years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Difficulties in the marriage arose sometime a year after their marriage and the Parties had numerous disputes that led to heated quarrels. Years later from February 2017, the Parties ceased living together as husband and wife. They however continued to reside in the Matrimonial Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 10 January 2022 on the basis that the Husband behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. The Husband subsequently filed his Defence and Counterclaim on 4 February 2022. The Parties subsequently came to an agreement and the divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis on the fact that the Parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least four years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ. The marriage was dissolved, and Interim Judgment was granted on 6 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues in Dispute and Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Parties filed the following affidavits in respect of the ancillary reliefs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 6 June 2023 (“WAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 June 2023 (“HAOM”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 22 September 2023 (“H2AM”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit filed on 25 September 2023 (“W2AM”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The hearing of the ancillary reliefs took place over three days, on 22 January 2022, 9 January 2024, and 17 April 2024. In respect of the children’s care orders, I recorded the Parties’ consent for the Wife to be granted sole care and control over the two children of marriage, with supervised access to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I ordered for the Parties to be granted joint custody of the children. In respect of the financial orders, I ordered the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 63.82:36.18 in favour of the Wife, no spousal maintenance for the Wife, and for the Husband to pay a total of $890.00 monthly for the two children’s maintenance. To achieve a division as close to the said ratio of 63.82:36.18, I made the following consequential distribution orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    The [Matrimonial Home] … shall be sold on the open market within 9 months of the Final Judgment.

The Wife also did not object to the Husband’s personal liabilities ($33,109.58) being satisfied from the same. The Parties however could not agree whether the same treatment was to be extended to the Wife’s substantial liabilities in her name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s Personal Liabilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     According to the Wife, she owed a total of $425,320.94 to creditor financial institutions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Wife explained that the Husband suffered a slipped disc in 2007 after carrying a heavy load during his then employment in logistics. He left that employment a year later as he was unable to involve himself in any physical activity or handle driving heavy machinery despite going for surgery. The Husband was generally unemployed between 2009 and 2012, with intermittent employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Between 2008 and 2015, the Wife alleged that she had used up her own moneys of $300,000.00 and more by obtaining credit card loans for the Husband to undergo expensive surgeries and psychiatric treatment at various hospitals and clinics.

liabilities, the Husband did not accept the quantum stated. I found this to be a somewhat curious position to take because of the clear documentary evidence in support.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband bore the consequent evidential burden to rebut the evidence put forward by the Wife, but the Husband had no evidence to the contrary. In light of this absence, I accepted the Wife’s case that she had personal liabilities of $375,012.17 as at the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For completeness, I refer to the Husband’s specific line of defence that his medical treatment was covered by insurance. This defence was used to address whether liabilities were in fact incurred by the Wife. I found that this line of defence did not assist the Husband in light of the clear document evidence tendered in the Wife’s supplementary affidavit of 21 February 2024 confirming the extent of her liabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Whether the Wife’s Personal Liabilities are to be Deducted from the Pool of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband took the position that the Wife’s personal liabilities should not be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets. No reasons or submissions were advanced in support of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As articulated by Choo Han Teck J in <em>WNR v WNQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30472-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 43</a> (“<em>WNR v WNQ</em>”), affirming the observations in <em>WAS v WAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27228-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 7</a>, the key issue is whether the spouse’s debts are proven to have existed as at the Interim Judgment date. If so, the spouse’s liabilities should rightly be accounted for when calculating the net matrimonial assets available for division. Further, there was no allegation whatsoever that the liabilities were incurred inappropriately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was therefore unsustainable in light of the observations in <em>WNR v WNQ</em>.

relative to the opposing party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be 60:40 in his favour. The Husband broadly relied on the following in support: (a) various indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister, (b) the Husband’s monthly contributions towards the family’s household expenses (<em>i.e. $</em>50.00 for household items and $1,300.00 towards the then family vehicle), (c) <em>ad hoc</em> past payments he made towards the family (<em>i.e.</em> purchase of an air conditioner and a laptop), and (d) various acts he had done in the past (<em>i.e.</em> ferrying the children to engagements and medical appointments).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife submitted that the indirect contributions ratio ought to be either 70:30 or 80:20 in her favour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Wife argued that she was the primary caregiver of the children and that the Husband was an absent father as he was totally involved in his drinking. The Wife additionally argued that she was the sole provider for the family and the household expenses were borne by her. To this end, she had to deplete her savings to ease the family expenses and took loans to pay for the Husband’s medical expenses following his injury. The Wife also alleged that the Husband was financially irresponsible and engaged in a cavalier attitude where he spent much time drinking outside with his friends after work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I adopted a broad-brush approach as articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>USB v USA</em> at [43] – [46] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions. Having considered the evidence and submissions in this case, I set the indirect contributions ratio as 60:40 in favour of the Wife given her relatively higher indirect financial and non-financial contributions. There were four material points that I considered when arriving at this finding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     First, I gave no credit to the Husband for the various alleged indirect financial and non-financial contributions by the Husband’s family. Assuming that these contributions did in fact occur, the Husband failed to show that these contributions were the result or product of his own personal efforts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I did not take into account the Wife’s personal liabilities that will be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, towards her indirect contributions. To do so would be double counting her efforts. If it had not been deducted, I would have agreed with the high indirect contributions ratio that she submitted in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Third, I accepted the Wife’s case that she was the primary caregiver and I accept that she provided for a substantial portion of the family expenses following the Husband’s injury. Based on the Husband’s own evidence, he was generally unemployed between 2009 and 2012, with intermittent employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The overall relatively lower levels of the Husband’s CPF accounts were also consistent with the Wife earning a significantly higher relative income between the Parties over the years. Additionally, and ironically, the Husband’s own submissions on indirect financial and non-financial contributions by his parents and his sister disclosed the lack of such contributions emanating from his own personal efforts. Similarly, the Husband’s submissions on his personal contributions, if assumed to be accurate, also revealed his relative lack of involvement and efforts. When considered holistically, the Husband submissions validated the Wife’s arguments that she should be credited with a higher ratio of indirect contributions <em>between the Parties</em>. For completeness and to avoid doubt, I did not accept that the Wife’s submissions that she was the <em>sole</em> provider for the family as I accepted that the Husband provided <em>some</em> contributions such as the purchase and maintenance of the then family vehicle and made some minor contributions towards the family expenses over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Finally, I rejected the Husband’s case that his insurance payouts would have covered all related contingencies and expenses arising from his injury. He provided no evidence whatsoever and he bore the burden of proof. Be that as it may, it could not be disputed that the Wife was in debt and the Husband was unemployed for a material period. This resulted in him minimally contributing towards the family’s finances, and the Wife having to make up for the lack of family income. Further, there was no evidence whatsoever that the loans that the Wife took was inappropriately incurred. When the facts and circumstances were considered as a whole and on a balance of probabilities, I accepted that the loans taken and serviced by the Wife prior to Interim Judgment were for the family expenses, which included the Husband’s medical treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     When the above-mentioned circumstances were considered, I was of the view that an indirect contributions ratio leaning in favour of the Wife amounting to 60:40 was merited. It could not however amount to the high ratio submitted by the Wife because a significant amount of her personal liabilities would be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets, and it would not also reflect the various indirect contributions made by the Husband over the years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Concluding the issue of indirect contributions, I wish to observe that taking the Husband’s case as its highest, I found his submissions on indirect contributions to be unreasonable and without basis. The points made in support showed no objectivity as to why they would merit a ratio that is relatively higher in his favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Step 3 – Overall Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The average ratio of direct and indirect contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets was consequently <b>63.82:36.18</b> in the Wife’s favour. Both Parties did not seek for further adjustments to be made. As such the average ratio was taken to be the final division ratio.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Distribution of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In order to achieve as close to the division ratio of <b>63.82:36.18</b> in the Wife’s favour, I ordered the distribution of the pool of matrimonial assets in the manner set out at [8] above. That distribution had the following effect:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"42.92%\"><col width=\"28.54%\"><col width=\"28.54%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">a) Share of the Net Value of the Matrimonial Home</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$355,488.34</p> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(78%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$100,265.94</p> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(22%)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">b) Assets in their respective names</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$309,793.59</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$90,542.94</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">c) <b><u>Less</u></b> Liabilities in their respective names</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">- $375,012.17</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">- $33,109.58</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Resulting Share of the Net Value ($447,969.06) of the Matrimonial Pool of Assets</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$290,269.76</b> </p> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(64.80%)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$157,699.30</b> </p> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>(35.20%)</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Since the Wife is to receive a significant majority of the equity (<em>i.e.</em> 78%) arising from the sale of the Matrimonial Home, I made the consequential order for the Wife to have sole conduct of its sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     At the conclusion of the hearing, the Wife sought costs of $3,000.00.

SUM 1631/2024 (“SUM 1631”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1632/2024 (“SUM 1632”) was the Husband’s application for discovery. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This is my decision in respect of SUM 1631 and SUM 1632.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1631</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife sought disclosure of the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Statement of Accounts for the Husband’s sole proprietorship (&quot;GC&quot;), for the years 2020 to 2023 (including but not limited to the profit and loss account and balance sheet); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Documents evidencing the estimated valuation of GC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Li, cited, in both oral, and written submissions, Rule 25 of the Matrimonial Proceedings Rules.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> As I pointed out to Mr Li during the hearing, this was clearly wrong. It was the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) that applied to this set of proceedings. That much is made clear by Rule 2 of the FJR 2014 which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Application</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, these Rules apply to all proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court, the Family Courts and the Youth Courts, whether such proceedings are commenced before, on or after 1 January 2015, in so far as the matters to which these Rules relate are within the jurisdiction of those Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Insofar as discovery in the context of ancillary relief was concerned, this is governed by Rules 63 – 68 of the FJR 2014. In particular, Rule 63 states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">63.—(1)    Subject to paragraphs (7) and (9) and rule 73, the Court may, at any time, on the application of any party to an action or matter (called in this rule the applicant), make an order requiring any other party (called in this rule the respondent) to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application, or any class of documents so specified or described —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Upon making an order under paragraph (1), if a document or class of documents is stated by the respondent in his affidavit to be in his possession, custody or power, the Court may order the party to exhibit a copy or copies of the document or class of documents in the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    An application for an order under this rule must be in the relevant Form, and be supported by an affidavit stating the belief of the deponent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the party from whom discovery is sought under this rule has, or at some time had, in his possession, custody or power, the document or class of documents specified or described in the application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the document falls within one of the following descriptions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(i) a document on which the party relies or will rely;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">(ii) a document which could —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(A)    adversely affect his own case;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(B)    adversely affect another party’s case;

or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(C)    support another party’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Before an application under paragraph (1) may be filed, the applicant must serve a written request on the respondent —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    seeking discovery of the said document or class of documents, in the relevant Form;

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any offer made by the respondent to give particulars or make admissions relating to any matter in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(9)    An order under paragraph (1) must not be made in respect of any party before the granting of the interim judgment, or before the Affidavit of Assets and Means has been filed by the plaintiff and the defendant, unless, in the opinion of the Court —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the order is necessary to prevent the disposal of a party’s assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the order is made in conjunction with an order preventing the disposal of a party’s assets; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    there is any other exceptional circumstance necessitating the making of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In the context of orders for discovery, the twin principles of relevance and necessity are also important and apply in the present case: <em>WZF v WZG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a> citing <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9];

Mr Li argued that these documents were relevant and necessary to determining the issue of the division of matrimonial assets, as well as maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The thrust of Mr Li’s arguments was that these documents were needed to place a value on GC. In that vein, Mr Li cited the cases of <em>ULH v ULI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21690-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 39</a> (“<em>ULH</em>”) at [23] – [25] and <em>UPU v UPV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22378-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 99</a> (“<em>UPU</em>”) at [25] to illustrate the point that assets belonging to a spouse’s sole proprietorship could be included in the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Mr Li also made the point that every sole proprietorship had to prepare a statement of accounts for the purposes of filing taxes – this meant that there was a basis to order discovery as the statements sought did, in fact, exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In response, counsel for the Husband, Ms Helena Amolak (“Ms Amolak”) explained that her client took the view that the documents sought were not relevant, and in any event, the Husband did not have the formal statement of accounts for GC or any documents evidencing the valuation of GC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Ms Amolak also explained that GC was merely a consultancy services business, and so there was no place of business because the Husband would work remotely from home. The business also had no equipment and no machinery. There were therefore no assets belonging to the sole proprietorship that could be valued. In any event, Ms Amolak also argued that discovery should not be ordered as the accounts of GC contained business-sensitive information relating to the Husband’s clients.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     These documents are, in my judgment, clearly relevant to the hearing of the ancillary matters claim. As illustrated by the cases of <em>ULH</em> and <em>UPU</em>, the value of assets under a sole proprietorship belonging to a spouse is a relevant consideration when it comes to ascertaining and dividing the matrimonial pool of assets. I would also add that the statement of accounts would shed some light on the Husband’s earning capacity – this would have a direct bearing on the issue of maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For completeness, I deal with the point that the Husband had made: that disclosure should not be ordered because the documents which he did have were internal records, and those contained “business-sensitive” information relating to his clients.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not think that this was a bar to ordering discovery in the present case. It was not open to the Husband to attempt to side-step his obligation to provide disclosure with the mere assertion that the documents sought contained “business-sensitive” information. If there is indeed any confidential information contained within the documents that are to be disclosed, it was open to the Husband to provide redacted copies, or to request that he be allowed to redact any sensitive client information from those documents. In any event, safeguards exist (in the form of the <em>Riddick</em> principle) to prevent the misuse of documents which have been disclosed in an action under compulsion: see <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> at [30] citing <em>Third Eye Capital Corp v Pretty View Shipping SA and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31294-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 96</a> (see also <em>Marcel v Commissioner of Police</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/69130-E-M.xml')\">[1992] 1 Ch. 225</a> at p 237).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1631 is therefore allowed for the reasons I have stated above. If the Husband is unable to produce these documents, he must provide an explanation in his affidavit, together with any supporting documents. To account for the Husband’s concerns over disclosing any business-sensitive information, I allow the Husband to redact, from the documents that are disclosed, information relating to client particulars. The Husband is also given liberty to apply to redact any additional information. In doing so, he must state, on affidavit, what additional information he seeks to redact, and the prejudice which would be suffered if redaction is not allowed (see <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> at [34] – [35]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1632</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband sought the following documents in discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Bank statements for the POSB account ending XX-7 for the past 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ms Amolak argued that the bank statements were relevant to the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance. She further explained that SUM 1632 had been taken out because the Wife had yet to provide these documents which could easily be downloaded from the online banking portal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, Mr Li stated that his client was not resisting the application for discovery. He explained, at the hearing, that the Wife had been informed by the bank that it would cost $1080 to obtain the bank statements for the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Mr Li also urged me to “rule more creatively”, in a manner that would be in line with therapeutic justice (“TJ”) and save parties’ time and costs, by either ordering the disclosure of quarterly statements, or ordering that the cost of obtaining the statements be split between both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I will allow the Husband’s request in SUM 1632. The Wife is to disclose the bank statements for the POSB account ending XX-7 for the period January 2021 – January 2024. There can be no dispute as to the relevance and necessity of these bank statements. It is indeed useful and relevant for the court to have sight of the Wife’s financial affairs in the period before the filing of the divorce, and after the divorce had been filed (<em>Tan Bing Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]). In the present case, the Statement of Particulars discloses, at paragraph 1(d), that the marriage had broken down as early as November 2018. The Husband had eventually filed for divorce on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of March 2023. The period of disclosure which I have ordered would provide both the court, as well as the Husband, an insight into the Wife’s finances following the breakdown of the marriage and in the months leading up to, and after the divorce had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Insofar as Mr Li had suggested that I should rule creatively in a manner that was in line with TJ, he did not go further to flesh out this point and explain how ordering the disclosure of quarterly statements or that the costs of discovery be split between the parties would accord with the principles of TJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I could not, in any event, accept this argument. One cannot simply quote TJ, without any reference to the applicable rules and principles that form part of our family law and expect to persuade the court to grant an order in terms of the prayers sought. The notion and practice of TJ must necessarily operate within the confines of existing legal principles. As the court in <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> had stated at [28]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28     <b>The notion of therapeutic justice operates within the framework of the law and does not prevail over the law</b>. Judges apply the law and legal principles in a system that is non-adversarial and conducive to problem-solving. Our family law is rich in legal principles and jurisprudence that promote therapeutic outcomes, and all legal actors in the family justice system would do well to apply the law to achieve therapeutic justice for our families.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In that vein, it is clear that the costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery. The court can, in the exercise of its inherent powers under Rules 958 and 959 of the FJR 2014, order the party entitled to discovery to “bear a whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such order for the giving of discovery”: Family Justice Courts Practice Directions para 81(35) and (36); Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at p 945.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I saw no reason, in the present case, to depart from the starting position that the party giving discovery is to bear the costs of doing so. For one, the Wife had not exhibited, in her affidavit, any evidence that she was unable to download digital copies of the bank statements free of charge. The Wife had also failed to exhibit, in her affidavit, evidence that she would have to pay $1080 to obtain these statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     That being said, while the Wife has not produced evidence before me to show that it would cost $1080 to obtain the bank statements, there was equally no evidence before me to show that the Wife would <b><em>not</em></b> incur such costs in obtaining the bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Given this set of circumstances, I might have been inclined to provide for a situation where the Wife did indeed incur disproportionate costs in obtaining the bank statements. However, because no arguments as to whether I should make such an order were advanced, either at the hearing before me, or in the course of written submissions, I decline to make such orders in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I would, however, observe that in a future case, it may well be open to the party giving discovery to seek liberty to apply for an order that the party entitled to discovery is to bear the entirety, or a portion of the costs that may be incurred in complying with the order for discovery. In doing so, that party must articulate their legal and factual basis for seeking such an order. Naturally, in deciding whether it is appropriate to make such an order, the court will consider all the relevant circumstances. This could include factors such as the quantum of such costs that had been incurred or were likely to be incurred, and whether there was any reasonable way to avoid incurring such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I therefore make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>SUM 1631</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in SUM 1631, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is granted leave to redact, from the documents that are disclosed, information relating to client particulars. In addition, the Husband shall have liberty to apply to redact any additional information that is business-sensitive in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>SUM 1632</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in SUM 1632, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power.

This is to be done no later than 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2024. For the avoidance of doubt, the time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs, and nothing that I have said here shall bind the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Li and Ms Amolak for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Arguments at p 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 41(b).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 42.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories – Whether providing a document in response to an interrogatory is a sufficient answer"],"date":"2024-07-15","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 5338 of 2022 (Summons No 1739 and 1684 of 2024)","title":"WZH v WZI","citation":"[2024] SGFC 48","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31841-SSP.xml","counsel":["Alain Abraham Johns and Emira Binte Abdul Razakjr (Alain A Johns Partnership) for the plaintiff","Muhammad Hasif Bin Abdul Aziz and Abdul Wahab Bin Saul Hamid (A.W.

In the years that followed, they welcomed two sons into their family. During this time, however, cracks were forming in their relationship. Matters reached a point of no return where the Husband filed for divorce on 17 November 2022. Interim judgment was obtained on 14 December 2023, and parties set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife has now taken out an application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1739/2024 (“SUM 1739”) and SUM 1684/2024 (“SUM 1684”) respectively. I heard parties on 24 June 2024 and now give my decision in respect of both summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery (SUM 1739)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife sought disclosure of bank statements, specifically of the following bank accounts in the Husband’s name:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     OCBC 360 account ending -XX1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     OCBC Easisave account ending -XX1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     POSB Passbook savings account ending -XX-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The period of disclosure sought was from September 2021 – September 2022 (<em>ie</em>, a year prior to the commence of divorce proceedings). The Wife argued, in written submissions, that disclosure was relevant and necessary to establishing whether the Husband had indeed been dissipating matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the course of oral hearings, counsel for the Wife, Mr Muhammad Hasif Bin Abdul Aziz (“Mr Hasif”), and counsel for the Husband, Mr Alain Abraham Johns (“Mr Johns”) crossed swords on whether the facts of <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> were similar to the present case such that discovery should be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I would observe that in the context of discovery applications, the decision whether to allow disclosure, while guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity, is necessarily a decision that must turn on the facts of the case at hand, taking into account all relevant circumstances. To that end, precedent is useful only insofar as they lay down guiding principles and provide an illustration as to how those principles are applied. Attempts at analogising or distinguishing precedent by close reference to the facts are, therefore, of limited utility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       While I have said that close attention must be paid to the facts of the present case in deciding whether discovery should be ordered, one must also be careful not to stray into the realm of matters that can only be ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matters. I make mention of this because at times, it appeared to me that both Mr Hasif, as well as Mr Johns, were trying to establish whether the Husband had indeed dissipated assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In my judgment, the documents which the Wife sought was indeed relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters. It is useful for the court, as well as the Wife, to have a picture of the Husband’s financial circumstances in the period shortly before the divorce was filed: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [25] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Furthermore, having perused the various affidavits filed, it was clear to me that one issue in dispute was whether the Husband had dissipated assets which should rightfully be accounted for in the matrimonial pool of assets. The statements which the Wife sought would clearly show if there were any unusual transactions in the months leading up to the filing of the divorce. Without these statements, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish whether the Husband had indeed disposed of assets prior to his filing of the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As a final point, I add that I could not agree with the Husband’s argument that the Wife’s application for discovery should be dismissed for procedural irregularity because he was never served with a request for the documents in the form stipulated by the Family Court Practice Directions (see Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This is because, in her first Request for Discovery dated 6 March 2024,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> the Wife had indeed sought monthly bank statements for all bank accounts in the Husband’s name for December 2021 to November 2022. I do note, however, that the period of disclosure which the Wife seeks in SUM 1739 appears to be different from that set out in her first Request for Discovery. I will therefore only order that the Husband disclose the bank statements for the period December 2021 to November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Subject to this slight change in the period of disclosure which I have ordered, the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1739 is allowed for the reasons I have set out above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Interrogatories (SUM 1684)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to consider the Wife’s request for interrogatories. Parties do not dispute that in deciding whether to order the Husband to answer the interrogatories posed, I must consider the relevance and necessity of the interrogatories. In addition, I must also consider whether the Husband had, in his Notice-in-Response to the Wife’s Request for Interrogatories, provided sufficient answers to the interrogatories (see <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [28] – [30]). Indeed, parties had, during the hearing, summarised the crux of their dispute over whether the interrogatories should be ordered, as focussing on the sufficiency of the answers which the Husband had provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I start with Item 1. This was the interrogatory posed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    I aver that the Plaintiff had bought one Rolex watch sometime during parties’ trip to Switzerland on October 2018, which is during the marriage (the “Rolex Watch”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b.    The Plaintiff is to provide the value of the Rolex Watch?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This was the same interrogatory which the Wife had posed in her Further Request for Interrogatories dated 7 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband had provided a response in a letter dated 28 May 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">i.    Yes. The trip was sometime in April 2018. The Plaintiff used pre-marriage assets to purchase the Rolex watch.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">ii.    The value of the Rolex Watch is about SGD18,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I am satisfied that this is a sufficient answer to the interrogatory that had been posed. It is clear that the Husband had answered the question. If the Wife has any quarrel with the <em>truth</em> of the Husband’s answers, she must take that up at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I would go further to add that it was also clear to me that this interrogatory was not necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters. I arrive at this conclusion having considered the interrogatories which the Wife had posed in her first Request for Interrogatories:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2a.    Does the Plaintiff has a watch collection? If the answer is yes, what is the total value of the watch collection?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     This was the Husband’s response in the letter from his lawyers dated 11 April 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff owns 3 Rolex watches with a total value of about $40,000. These watches were purchased before the marriage and are pre-marriage assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In short, the Wife had already asked the Husband whether he did have a watch collection, and if so, the value of that collection. The Husband had given a sufficient answer. He disclosed that he owned three Rolex watches worth $40,000. Taking this into account, it was quite clear that Item 1 was not necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 1 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn now to Item 2. This interrogatory related to certain insurance policies which the Husband had with [Y]. The Wife wanted the Husband to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Explain why these policies were “no longer valid”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Provide the amounts received when these policies were “no longer valid”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     State the accounts to which these amounts had been disbursed to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     This was the Husband’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">i.    The Plaintiff was unable to afford the high premiums of Policy No. XXXXX177 and the Plaintiff had surrendered Policy No. XXXXX944 as he required funds to pay for personal and business expenses. This was stated at S/No. 3 in the Plaintiff’s Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 11 April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">ii.    The screenshots from the Plaintiff’s [Y] Insurance Account show that Policy No. XXXXX177 and XXXXX944 are no longer valid, as they no longer appear. Please refer to Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 16 February 2024 at pages 54 to 57.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iii.  As stated at paragraph 2 e.iv. of NIRI, the amount received from the surrender of Policy No. XXXXX944 was $668,031.17. There was no surrender value for Policy No. XXXXX177 as the Plaintiff was unable to make payment of the high premiums and accordingly, the policy had lapsed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iv.    As stated at paragraph 2 e.iv. of NIRI, the amount was received into the Plaintiff’s POSB No. XXX-XXXXX-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am satisfied that this is a sufficient answer. The Husband had clearly explained why he had to give up both policies. He had also stated the sums received from surrendering these policies, as well as the bank accounts into which the proceeds had been deposited. If the Wife believes that the Husband’s answer is untrue, the proper place to ventilate this is before the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 2 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I come now to Item 3. It was a rather lengthy interrogatory comprising several parts. In essence, the Wife wanted the Husband to explain and provide details of several transactions. The Wife also queried the Husband on his business expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the outset, I observe that the Wife had also asked, in her request for interrogatories, that the Husband produce various documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">b.    Based on the NIRI, the Plaintiff seems to allege that he paid $445,000.00 ($150,000.00 + $150,000.00 + $20,000.00 + $10,000.00 + $20,000.00 + $40,000.00 + $5,000.00 + $50,000.00) in legal fees. The Plaintiff is to provide the documents to show that the Plaintiff has paid $445,000.00 to his divorce lawyers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">c.    With reference to paragraph 2.d.ii. of the NIRI,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">i.    The Plaintiff is to provide the full particulars and withdrawal documents for the investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">ii.    The Plaintiff is to provide the particulars of the payments for the new matrimonial home and renovations? The Plaintiff is to provide the documentary evidence for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">iii.   The Plaintiff is to provide the details of what happened to the amounts that were not used for the payment to the new matrimonial home and / or renovations? The Plaintiff is to provide the documentary evidence for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife had also, in her written submissions, argued that documents should be disclosed as part of any orders made in relation to interrogatories:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10.    Further and specifically to S/N 2 and 3 of the Interrogatories, the Wife highlights and reiterates (with reference to <em>VTQ v VTR</em>) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    It would be in the Husband’s interest to provide full and frank disclosure of relevant documents as this would help dispel any notion or suspicion that he might have dissipated or concealed matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given this request for documents (see above at [25]), at the hearing, Mr Johns raised an objection on the grounds of legal privilege. He argued that the invoices might be “impacted by solicitor-client privilege” and the Husband should therefore not be ordered to disclose those invoices. Mr Johns, however, took the position that legal privilege was not a bar to ordering that the Husband answer the interrogatories in the event that his answer was found to be insufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Leaving aside the question of legal privilege, I do not allow the Wife’s corresponding request for the disclosure of these documents simply because she had not asked for these documents in her application for discovery in SUM 1739. As the court in <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9] (see also <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21]) had made clear, there is a difference between discovery and interrogatories. A request for discovery cannot be smuggled in under the cover of an application for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As for the sufficiency of the Husband’s answers in response to Item 3, having read those, it was clear to me that he had replied to every part of the interrogatory which had been posed, and provided ample details. The Wife may well dispute the <em>truth</em> of these answers, but in my judgment, the Wife can have no quarrel with the <em>sufficiency</em> of these answers (see <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [27] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, I note that the Husband had, in response to the Wife’s interrogatory on his business expenses, disclosed a business agreement. That agreement set out the sums which the Husband claims to have incurred, and was, in my view, a sufficient answer to the interrogatory which had been posed. While I have noted above (at [28]) that a party may not, in their request for interrogatories, demand that the other party disclose documents, I would take the tentative view that a party who is responding to an interrogatory can disclose a document as their answer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 3 is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I turn now to Item 4. This Item contained interrogatories pertaining to the Husband’s income. The Wife sought details as to the lump sum payments which the Husband had or would receive from his work in April and May 2024 (Item 4a), as well as whether he had won any awards (Item 4b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In relation to the lump sum payments, this interrogatory had been posed in the Wife’s request dated 6 March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She had asked whether the Husband would be receiving a lump sum bonus to the tune of $80,000 to $100,000 for work done in April/May 2024. This was the Husband’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">iv.    In relation to Interrogatory 6(d), the numbers should be accurately reflected in the income statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     This was, in my judgment, not a sufficient answer. The Husband had not directly answered the question. He provided no confirmation as to whether he would indeed be receiving a lump sum bonus, or the quantum of such a bonus.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the interrogatory relating to whether the Husband had won any awards at work, he had not provided an answer. The Wife argued that this interrogatory was relevant and necessary to assessing the Husband’s financial capacity and income ability.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     This interrogatory was, in my judgment, not necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters. The Husband had already disclosed his IRAS statements for the years 2021 – 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was no need for the Wife to establish the Husband’s “financial capacity and income ability”, by this rather roundabout means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I will therefore order that the Husband answer the interrogatory that had been framed in Item 4a. The Wife’s request in respect of Item 4b is disallowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out at paragraph 8 of the Wife’s affidavit filed in support of SUM 1739 for the period December 2021 to November 2022, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall answer, on affidavit, the following interrogatory to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       With reference to paragraph 2.f.iv. of the NIRI, whether the Plaintiff has and / or will receive lump sum payments in April and May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband’s compliance affidavits are to be filed by 2 August 2024. As for costs, parties are to write in with their submissions, which shall be no longer than 3 pages each, by way of letter. This is to be done no later than 22 July. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To avoid doubt, nothing I have said in this judgment shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Hasif and Mr Johns for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Wife did file a request, but the request was not set out in the form as dictated by the Practice Directions.

I relieved the husband of his obligation to maintain the wife forthwith but declined to vary his obligation to maintain the child. The husband is dissatisfied with these decisions. I now provide my grounds for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The spouses married in 2014 and divorced in 2018. They had a child in 2015. During the divorce, they agreed that the husband would provide monthly maintenance of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child. The total sum of $1,500 was to be paid to the wife on the first calendar day of each month. This agreement was recorded in an interim judgment, FC/IJ 3930/2018, which was made final in FC/FJ 5140/2018 (the “Consent Judgment”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The husband fell behind on these maintenance payments. In June 2020, the wife filed a Maintenance Summons, MSS 1613/2020, to enforce the arrears that had accrued. This summons was determined in October 2020 through a consent order, EMO 1054/2020. Thereunder, the husband acknowledged that the arrears totalled $37,500 and agreed to pay them in instalments of $500 per month. This consent order also clarified that the monthly maintenance payments of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child would continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The husband again fell behind on his payments of the arrears under EMO 1054/2020 and of the ongoing maintenance under the Consent Judgment. In December 2021, the wife filed another Maintenance Summons, MSS 2680/2021, to enforce these arrears. This summons was determined in April 2022 through an adjudicated order of enforcement, EMO 284/2022. Therein, the court found that the arrears totalled $60,500 and ordered the husband to pay them in instalments of $1,000 per month. This order also confirmed that the monthly maintenance payments of $300 for the wife and $1,200 for the child would continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In May 2023, the wife filed a third Maintenance Summons, MSS 1097/2023. Therein, she alleged that the husband had once again fallen behind on the payments of the arrears under EMO 284/2022 and of the ongoing maintenance under the Consent Judgment. According to the wife, these arrears totalled $63,000 as of May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In August 2023, the husband commenced these proceedings to vary his obligations to maintain the wife and the child under the Consent Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband sought to be relieved of his obligations in the Consent Judgment to maintain the wife in the monthly sum of $300 and the child in the monthly sum of $1,200. He asked that this relief be back-dated to “a date to be determined by the Court”. He deposed that he had agreed to these sums during the divorce because “the [wife] wanted it and I gave in to her request”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and even though he would struggle to pay them. He claimed that he had entered into the Consent Judgment because he had been “psychologically troubled” and “depressed” during the divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Further, during the divorce proceedings, I was psychologically troubled and felt depressed. I had failed to make sound choices and did not address my difficulties in making monthly maintenance payments due to my state of mind. I was also unrepresented then and felt pressured by everything was that ongoing. These factors contributed to me agreeing to the maintenance sums ordered in the [Consent Judgment].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue estoppel </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the outset, the orders of enforcement of arrears of maintenance in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 (see [3] and [4] above) complicated the attempts by the husband to vary his maintenance obligations with retrospective or back-dated effect. In making these orders of enforcement, the court had determined the accrued arrears and the quantum of arrears that were due from the husband (insofar as cause had been shown as to why any other part of the arrears should not be enforced under r 116(9) of the Family Justice Rules 2014). These determinations crystallised the quantum of arrears as of the time when the order of enforcement was made. Unless these determinations were disturbed, whether on appeal or otherwise, they were final and conclusive judgments on the merits that created issue estoppel between the spouses (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0157.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157</a> at [14]–[15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This issue estoppel, which was part of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, produced at least two consequences in subsequent proceedings between the spouses to vary orders of maintenance (including orders for the maintenance of children of the marriage). First, it prevented the spouses from challenging the quantum of arrears that were due at the time of the order of enforcement. Second, and by implication, it prevented the spouses from challenging the reasonableness of the substantive orders of maintenance that underlay those arrears as of the time of the order of enforcement. Further, this issue estoppel applied even if the earlier determinations had been erroneous because of the private and public interests protected by the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> (see Sundaresh Menon CJ, “Transnational Relitigation and the Doctrine of Transnational Issue Estoppel”, paper delivered at the 8th Judicial Seminar on Commercial Litigation (14 March 2024) at paras 15–16). The private interest lay in the right of the spouses to be free from vexation by re-litigation of the issue of maintenance in respect of the same timeframe, which freedom enabled them to move on from the divorce, to heal, and to re-cast their futures. The public interest lay in upholding the integrity of the court process by securing the end of litigation that conduced to the efficient adjudication of disputes and that protected the authority of the judicial decisions from unceasing challenges.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     That said, issue estoppel was subject to a qualification known as the “<em>Arnold</em> exception” (see <em>Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/69027-E-M.xml')\">[1991] 2 AC 93</a>). This <em>Arnold</em> exception enabled a litigant to, in exceptional cases, reopen an issue that had been previously determined. Nevertheless, stringent conditions governed the application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception. To invoke it, five conditions had to be met: (a) that the prior decision directly affected the future determination of the parties’ rights; (b) that the prior decision had been clearly wrong; (c) that the error in the prior decision had arisen because a point was not taken before the court that made the decision, and the point could not reasonably have been so taken; (d) that any rights accruing under the prior decision would not be clawed back, and any effects of the prior decision would not be undone; and (e) great injustice would arise were issue estoppel to apply (see <em>The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18226-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 1104</a> at [103] and [139]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As between the spouses in these proceedings, the quantum of arrears of maintenance for the wife and for the child had been determined in October 2020 (in EMO 1054/2020) and again in April 2022 (in EMO 284/2022). These determinations were final and conclusive judgments on the merits. Hence, and unless the husband could avail himself of the <em>Arnold</em> exception, issue estoppel applied in these proceedings to preclude him from challenging the quantum of arrears and the necessity of the substantive orders of maintenance that underlay those arrears as of October 2020 and April 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The husband claimed that the wife had been in a “stable financial position even during the Covid period when [he] was jobless and suffered an income loss”. He added that she did not need further support because her monthly income was $4,000 while his monthly income was only $3,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I agreed with the husband that the wife had sufficient earning capacity to maintain herself and that it was no longer necessary for him to maintain her. The wife confirmed that her monthly income ranged between $2,780 and $4,500 depending on overtime, commissions, and bonuses. She also deposed that the monthly sum of $300 in maintenance for her under the Consent Judgment was to her a “token” amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As the Family Court had repeatedly observed, “a spousal maintenance order is not to be regarded as a meal ticket for life and should not be intended to create life-long dependency by an ex-wife on the ex-husband” (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>UHK v UHL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29612-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 12</a> (“<em>UHK</em>”) at [39] and <em>VOX v VOY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25643-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 11</a> at [38]). Here, the marriage lasted only four years while nearly six years had passed since the divorce. The income of the wife equipped her to support herself. It was thus justified to relieve the husband of his obligation to maintain her. As eloquently put by District Judge Kenneth Yap in <em>UHK</em>, the wife “should look towards this improvement positively, and draw satisfaction from her ability to be self-reliant and enjoy greater independence from her former husband’s support” (at [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Nevertheless, I did not rescind the wife maintenance with retrospective or back-dated effect. The husband initially prayed that the recission should be “backdated to a date to be determined by the Court”. He later deposed that he sought a recission from the date of these proceedings, <em>ie</em>, August 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Given the relatively short period of time between August 2023 and the conclusion of these proceedings in April 2024, most of which time was spent on mediation, I did not find such a back-dating of the rescission necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I noted that the husband also sought to “set aside any arrears of [wife] maintenance” that had accrued. In my view, this was a request that had to be made to the court hearing the pending application to enforce the arrears of maintenance, MSS 1097/2023 (see [5] above). In any event, the bulk of these arrears had accrued between the divorce in August 2018 and EMO 284/2022 in April 2022. These arrears had been determined and crystallised in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 (see [3] and [4] above). Issue estoppel to prevent the re-litigation of these arrears in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance of child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The husband began by complaining that he had not been granted access to the child and thus knew little about the life and expenses of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He then claimed that the monthly expenses of the child had fallen below $1,200 since the making of the Consent Judgment, and referred to the tables that had been exhibited in MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021 (the “Expense Tables”) in support of this claim.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He added that he was in any event unable to pay the arrears of maintenance that had accrued since the Consent Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I did not agree with the husband that the maintenance for the child should be reduced or rescinded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The complaints of the husband about his access to the child were not germane to his obligation to maintain the child. Issues about the access of a parent to a child were analytically distinct from issues about the obligation of that parent to maintain the child. Still, directions for the husband to exercise access to the child had since been made in related proceedings (see Summons No 2376 of 2023), and those directions appeared to have assuaged the concerns of the husband about his access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The claim by the husband that the expenses of the child had fallen below $1,200 after the Consent Judgment was based on the Expense Tables. The Expense Tables reflected the expenses of the child as of June 2020 and December 2021, when MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021 respectively were filed. Yet those proceedings concluded in orders of enforcement that recorded the monthly arrears of maintenance at $1,500, including $1,200 for the child, as of October 2020 and April 2022 (see EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022). The quantum of child maintenance for which the husband was liable as of October 2020 and April 2022 had thus been determined to be $1,200. Further, issue estoppel precluded the husband from challenging that determination, regardless of whether it had been erroneous, unless the <em>Arnold</em> exception applied. And it was unclear how the <em>Arnold</em> exception could apply when the Expense Tables had been exhibited in MSS 1613/2020 and MSS 2680/2021, in which this determination had been made. Despite these Expense Tables, the husband <em>consented</em> to EMO 1054/2020 and did not challenge EMO 284/2022. It was no longer open to him to rely on the Expense Tables or to dispute his liability as of October 2020 and April 2022 to maintain the child in the monthly sum of $1,200. This constraint arose because of the public interest in upholding the integrity of the court process by securing the end of litigation (see <em>Kho Jabing v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19124-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1273</a> at [2])) and operated regardless of whether such an objection had been taken by the wife in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In consequence of this issue estoppel, I was constrained to consider only the circumstances after October 2020 and April 2022 for the purpose of this application to vary the obligation of the husband to maintain the child. On the evidence before me, the monthly income of the husband had been $3,000 since November 2021 and had remained “stable” thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Similarly, there had been little change in the monthly expenses of the husband, the wife, and the child since April 2022. Specifically, the husband adduced no evidence on the monthly expenses of the child after April 2022, and the wife deposed that those expenses amounted to $1,476.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> There was thus no material change of circumstances to justify a variation of the obligation of the husband to maintain the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Ultimately, the issue estoppel that flowed from EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 meant that the only circumstances that were relevant in these proceedings were those after April 2022. During this period, there had been little change in the earning capacity of the husband or in the expenses of the child. Even if the Expense Tables could have shown that the expenses of the child had decreased, it would have been unjust to have recourse to them. The husband had, by his consent to EMO 1054/2020 and his non-challenge of EMO 284/2022, forewent his right to rely on the Expense Tables and or to dispute his liability to maintain the child in the monthly sum of $1,200 as of April 2022. Insofar as the determinations in EMO 1054/2020 and EMO 284/2022 on the quantum of the arrears and the liability of the husband to maintain the child had been erroneous, the husband had ample opportunity to challenge them. Yet the husband did not avail himself of that opportunity. As a result, the public and private interests protected by issue estoppel and the wider doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> constrained me to proceed on those determinations in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     For these reasons, I relieved the husband of his obligation to maintain the wife but not of his obligation to maintain the child. This order was to take effect forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I made no order on the costs of this application.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 37.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 27.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s First Affidavit at para 43.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit at para 91.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-07-11","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2741 of 2020 (Summons No 1298 of 2024)","title":"WYV v WYW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 47","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31733-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Sarah-Mae Thomas and Larissa Mira Balmadres (Sarah-Mae Thomas LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYV v WYW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYV <em>v</em> WYW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31733-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 47</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2741 of 2020 (Summons No 1298 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">11 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Sarah-Mae Thomas and Larissa Mira Balmadres (Sarah-Mae Thomas LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYV — WYW </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">11 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision in respect of costs for SUM 1298 of 2024 (“SUM 1298”). My substantive decision in respect of SUM 1298, which was the Father’s application to strike out the Mother’s application for a variation of access orders in relation to the children of their marriage, can be found in <em>WYV v WYW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31695-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 44</a> (“<em>WYV</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard parties on 11 July 2024 and made no order as to costs. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Arguments </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Father, Ms Sarah-Mae Thomas (“Ms Thomas”), argued that her client, having succeeded in his striking out application, should be entitled to costs. As to the quantum of costs, Ms Thomas submitted that it should be fixed at $4500, plus disbursements of $577.52. In calibrating the quantum of costs, Ms Thomas urged me to take into account the Mother’s conduct, specifically, that it was clear that there was no basis for taking out SUM 893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In response, the Mother argued that she did have a basis for taking out SUM 893. She explained that she could not, as a mother, sit idly by in the face of what the children had told her. The Mother urged me to, in considering whether there was a basis for taking out SUM 893, account for the fact that she was a self-represented person. The Mother also asserted that she was currently unemployed and did not have any resources to spare – while she did have a licence as a property agent, it was difficult for her to close any deals because she had to look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In response, Ms Thomas pointed out that the Mother had provided no evidence that she was in dire financial straits. What was in evidence, however, was that the Mother was renting out her HDB flat. Ms Thomas further argued that the Mother should not be allowed to escape without paying costs, especially since the Father had to engage counsel to deal with SUM 893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At this juncture, I asked Ms Thomas to address me on the case of <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”) and whether the proposition of law, that it was appropriate to make no order as to costs in a situation where parties had an acrimonious relationship, should be applied in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ms Thomas argued that the proposition in <em>JBB</em> cannot be taken as a shield for abusing the process of court. There could not be a blanket exception for every litigant who takes out a vexatious claim or tries to abuse the court process. There was bound to be acrimony in divorce cases, but her client should not be harassed by applications of this nature and the cost consequences had to reflect that. Ms Thomas also highlighted the point that insofar as the court might make no order as to costs to avoid aggravating relations between the parties with an order of costs – this was to facilitate co-parenting arrangements. However, in the present case, the co-parenting arrangements had been frustrated as Father had not been able to see his daughter for the past two years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I allowed the Mother to respond to the points which Ms Thomas had made. She stood by her assertion that finances were tight on her end, and that she had no income at all despite having a property agent licence. The Mother also further argued that the Father’s allegations of alienation had not been established.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       To this, Ms Thomas raised one final point in reply – that DJ Amy Tung (“DJ Tung”) had, in her decision for MSS 1384/2022, rescinded DJ Yong’s orders in relation to the Mother’s maintenance. Ms Thomas highlighted that DJ Tung had found that the Mother had misrepresented that she had not passed her real estate examination. In this vein, Ms Thomas characterised the Mother as a person who would misrepresent facts time and time again to the court, and urged me to assess all that the Mother had said in this light.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Mother’s reply was that she had only misrepresented the fact that she did not have a real estate licence – she did not make any misrepresentation as to the earnings she had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The principles relating to costs are summarised in <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [9]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7    Insofar as the principles governing costs are concerned, they can be found in Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. In essence, if the court does award costs, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event. The court can, however, depart from this starting point, taking into account factors such as the conduct of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8    One reason for departing from this starting point, and ordering that each party is to bear their own costs, or making no order as to costs, is to “minimise acrimony and discontent between parties” (see also <em>VJL v VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24701-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 59</a> at [135]; <em>TIJ v TIK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18469-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 147</a> at [23]). That was the point which had been made in <em>JBB</em>. There is much sense to taking such an approach. From a practical perspective, an order to pay costs may well create the potential for further discontent between parties. For instance, one party may well be tempted to, in an attempt to spite the other party, refuse to pay costs. This would spawn further applications to enforce the costs order (see <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26685-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 107</a> at [134] – [135]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9    It bears noting that what had been said in <em>JBB</em> is not a hard and fast rule – it does not mean that parties should always have to bear their own costs in matrimonial proceedings (see <em>WQR v WQS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30388-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 41</a> at [88]). Ultimately, costs are in the court’s discretion, and in certain cases, for example, where a party has acted unreasonably in the proceedings, that party may very well be ordered to bear the other party’s costs: see <em>UHG v UHH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21040-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 116</a> at [63] – [68]; <em>UTN v UTO and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23424-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 18</a> at [107]; <em>TNX v TNY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18869-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 50</a> at [51] – [60]. This may also be the case where a party has taken an adversarial stance in proceedings – an award of costs would reflect that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the present case, as I had observed in my written grounds for SUM 1298, both the Father and the Mother did have an acrimonious relationship (<em>WYV</em> at [89]), and there was a risk that the children would be triangulated into their dispute. I had also encouraged both parties to set aside their differences and to find ways to work together in the best interests of their children (<em>WYV</em> at [94]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is with this in mind that I deemed it fit to make no order as to costs. The children are at a stage of their lives where they will need the support and guidance of both their parents (<em>WYV</em> at [89]). That can hardly be achieved if both parents continue to wage war against each other in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     To avoid doubt, the time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents showing the value of assets under a trust fund","Family Law – Procedure – Discovery – Documents not yet in existence"],"date":"2024-07-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1420 of 2023 (Summons No 1269 of 2024)","title":"WZF v WZG","citation":"[2024] SGFC 46","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31712-SSP.xml","counsel":["Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","Jasmine Yan (Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WZF v WZG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WZF <em>v</em> WZG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31712-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 46</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1420 of 2023 (Summons No 1269 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">05 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; Jasmine Yan (Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WZF — WZG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Documents showing the value of assets under a trust fund</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Documents not yet in existence</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">5 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married on the 26<sup>th</sup> of June 2015 in Perth. Almost three years later, they welcomed their son into the family. Beneath the surface, however, cracks were forming in their relationship. The details of how the relationship between Husband and Wife had broken down are set out in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). They tell the tale of how the Husband had behaved in such an unreasonable way that the Wife could not be expected to live with him. That was the ground of divorce which the Wife relied on when she eventually filed for divorce on 27 March 2023. Interim judgment was subsequently granted on the 29<sup>th</sup> of November 2023. Parties then proceeded to exchange their voluntary requests for both discovery and interrogatories. Dissatisfied with the Husband’s response, the Wife took out SUM 1269 of 2024 (“SUM 1269”) seeking discovery in respect of 15 categories of documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard oral arguments from parties on 24 June 2024. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision in respect of SUM 1269</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The twin principles of relevance and necessity govern when discovery should be ordered: <em>WYX v WYY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a> at [5] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [21] – [25] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [9]; <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>; <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a>.

Ms Looi had also explained that the statements sought were for the period shortly before the breakdown of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The only response which Ms Yan had was that the Husband did not have the documents which were asked for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There can be no quarrel as to the relevance, or the necessity of the documents that the Wife seeks. It is indeed useful for the court, as well as the Wife, to have a picture of the Husband’s financial affairs in the period leading up to, and shortly after the breakdown of the marriage: <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19]. I will therefore allow the request in respect of Item 1. The Husband is to disclose these documents. If he cannot produce them, he must state his reasons, and provide the relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I turn now to address Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. These were statements of the Husband’s other bank accounts from January 2022 to the present date. Ms Looi explained that the Wife took the view that there had been no full and frank disclosure by the Husband in respect of these accounts. That was because in the Husband’s Notice in Response (“NIR”) to the Wife’s request for voluntary discovery, he had stated that there were no such accounts. However, in response to SUM 1269, the Husband had stated that these accounts had been closed. The Wife takes the position that if these accounts had indeed been closed, then the Husband should provide documentary evidence of the account closure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In response, Ms Yan said that in respect of Items 2 and 5, the bank accounts were not in existence. As for Items 3, 4, 7 and 8, the Husband had called the bank but was still unable to get the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 is allowed. If the Husband does not have these documents, he must provide an explanation together with any relevant supporting documents. He cannot sidestep his obligation to provide disclosure with the mere assertion that these documents do not exist: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75]. Finally, I add that there can be no quarrel as to the relevance and necessity of these documents – they would shed light on the Husband’s financial affairs in the period leading up to the filing of the divorce, and the period after the divorce had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As for Items 6 and 9, these too were requests for statements of the Husband’s bank accounts for the period January 2022 to January 2023, and January 2022 to February 2023 respectively. Ms Looi argued that while the Husband claimed that he had requested for the documents, he had yet to produce them, and there was no visibility as to when these documents would be produced. The Wife therefore had to seek disclosure of those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In response, Ms Yan explained that the Husband had called the bank to ask for the account statements, but he had been told that more time would be needed before the statements could be sent to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 6 and 9 is allowed. Parties did not dispute the relevance, or necessity of these documents to the ancillary matters hearing. The real dispute was when the Husband could produce these documents. As I have explained above (at [7]), if the Husband cannot produce these documents, he must provide an explanation together with any relevant supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I come now to Items 10 and 11. These were requests for the Husband’s income tax statements in Singapore and Australia. Ms Looi argued that these documents were relevant and necessary because the Husband had only stated that he was earning $7500 per month, but he had not produced any documents evidencing his income. These documents were relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters because child maintenance was a live issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ms Yan stated that the Husband had not filed any income tax since 2020. He had, however, instructed his auditors to help prepare and file his income tax returns in Australia, but his auditors had told him that some time would be required before that could be done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s request in respect of Items 10 and 11 are allowed. The Husband’s income tax statements are indeed relevant and necessary for determining the Husband’s income. Although both Ms Yan and Ms Looi had crossed swords on whether the Husband had not filed any income tax statements for a long time, this was not a material consideration in deciding whether discovery should be ordered. The point is, and Ms Looi had alluded to this in her oral arguments, that if the Husband indeed had not filed any tax returns, there would be some evidence from the tax authorities to that effect. The Husband must therefore disclose his income tax statements. If he cannot produce them, he must explain why, and provide documentary evidence from the tax authorities in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I turn now to the Wife’s request in Item 12. The documents which the Wife sought were in respect of the Australian and Singapore corporate entities of the [A] Group of Companies (the “Companies”). She wanted the audited financial statements or unaudited profit and loss statements of the Husband’s companies for the period 2020 to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Ms Looi argued that the Husband should be able to produce these documents because he was the sole director and shareholder of the Companies. Ms Yan did not dispute this point. She explained that the Husband’s instructions were that he did not have the audited statements that the Wife had asked for, and that he was currently waiting for the auditors to prepare the statements. In any event, as Ms Yan argued, the period of disclosure should only be from 2022 to the present date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The applicable principles relating to the disclosure of company documents in discovery are set out in the High Court decision of <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery)</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194) (see also <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [41] – [44]; <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31611-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 37</a> at [23] – [26]). Given that the Husband is indeed the sole shareholder and director of the Companies,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I am satisfied that the documents sought are either within his possession, or within his power to obtain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Insofar as Ms Yan had stated that the Husband was still waiting for the statements to be prepared, this was not a bar to ordering discovery. I note that the court in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> had stated, at [64], that a “prerequisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some evidence that the document requested is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power. The standard of proof is that of a <em>prima facie</em> case”. I would go one step further and add that the court can order discovery if there is <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought will come into existence at some point in the future. This point was illustrated in <em>G v G (Financial Provision: Discovery)</em> [1992] 1 FLR 40. In that case, the husband had recently joined a firm of solicitors and the partnership deed, which the wife sought disclosure of, had yet to be drawn up. Bracewell J ruled (at p 42) that that the court’s power to order discovery was not merely limited to documents that were already in existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As for the period of disclosure, I could not agree with Ms Yan that the period of disclosure should only be from 2022 till the present date. It was, in my judgment, necessary to order a wider period of disclosure given that it had been stated, in the SOP, that the Wife had no clear picture of the Husband’s “financial ability” despite their years of marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the above reasons, I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I come now to Item 13. The Wife was seeking documents relating to the [B] Family Trust account and documents stating the value of the trust account. Ms Looi argued that I should order disclosure because pursuant to cl 6.3 of the trust deed, the Husband could, as the sole beneficiary of the trust, obtain a valuation of the assets held by the trust. While Ms Looi acknowledged that the trust deed was governed by Australian law, she made the point that there was no need to refer to Australian law to establish the proposition that a beneficiary of a trust is entitled to ask the trustee for an account. That was because cl 6.3 had very clearly set this out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>6.3 Accounts, Records, Information and Documents</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The Trustee will keep complete and accurate records of all receipts and expenditures on account of the Trust Fund</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Promptly after the close of each Accounting Period, the Trustee will prepare a written accounting report (prepared in accordance with the accounting practices and standards generally accepted in Australia) for that Accounting Period consisting of a:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    Statement of income and expenditure; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    List of assets and liabilities at the close of that Accounting Period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Without prejudice to any right of the Trustee to refuse disclosure of any document, the Trustee will not be bound to disclose to any person:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(1)    A document disclosing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(A)    the deliberations of the Trustee as to the manner in which the Trustee should exercise a power vested in, or discretion conferred on, the Trustee by this Deed; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(B)    the reasons for a particular exercise of or failure or refusal to exercise, a power or discretion by the Trustee, or the material upon which those reasons were or might have been based; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Any other document relating to the exercise or proposed exercise of a power or discretion conferred by the Trustee (not being legal advice obtained by the Trustee as an expense of the Trust Fund).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response, Ms Yan stated that the Husband’s position was that he had disclosed the trust deed and that there were no other documents in his possession. Insofar as the Husband could, pursuant to the trust deed, request for the documents, some time would be needed for those documents to be prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 13. Documents disclosing the value of the assets held on trust were certainly relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters, specifically, the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets. For completeness, I note that cl 6.3 did not expressly state that the Husband could, as the sole beneficiary, ask for documents disclosing the value of assets held on trust for him. All that cl 6.3 stated was that the Trustee would prepare written accounting reports. There was <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents which the Wife was seeking did exist. Given that the Husband did not dispute that he <em>could</em> obtain these documents, I did not see the need to interrogate whether the Husband had, pursuant to Australian law, the power to ask for those documents as the sole beneficiary of the trust.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I turn now to the penultimate item on the list: Item 14. This was a request for the Husband to disclose documents evidencing the current surrender value of an endowment fund which the Husband had taken out for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The real dispute in relation to Item 14 was when the Husband could disclose the documents sought. Ms Looi explained that the Wife wanted clarity as to when the Husband could provide the documents. Ms Yan, on the other hand, pointed to an email sent by the Husband, showing that he had put in a request for the documents, but was currently awaiting a response.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     There was no dispute between parties as to the relevance or necessity of the documents sought. Rather, the quarrel was as to when these documents could be produced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I therefore allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 14. If the Husband cannot produce these documents, he must provide an explanation in his compliance affidavit, together with any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I come now to Item 15. This was a request for the Husband to disclose the Husband’s superannuation account in Australia. Ms Looi argued that because these documents could be easily obtained online, it was difficult to accept the Husband’s explanations as to the delays in obtaining those documents. The Wife thus took the view that the Husband was attempting to evade her request for those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Ms Yan stated that the Husband’s instructions were that he was currently waiting for his advisor to provide him with the necessary documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife’s request in respect of Item 15 is allowed. There can be no dispute as to the relevance and necessity of these documents to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I therefore order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents as set out in Items 1 – 15 of the Schedule annexed to SUM 1269, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband’s compliance affidavit is to be filed and served by 7 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for costs of SUM 1269, Ms Looi argued that the Husband should pay costs to the Wife, fixed at $2500 (all in). In response, Ms Yan argued that it was the Wife who should have to pay costs to the Husband, though she made no argument as to the quantum of costs payable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I fix costs at $2400 (all in), to be paid by the Husband to the Wife within 14 days of this judgment. In doing so, I take into account the fact that the Wife has obtained orders for discovery in respect of all the items which she had prayed for in SUM 1269, as well as the fact that the matter was not particularly complex.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Looi and Ms Yan for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 1269 at p 35 and pp 40 – 41.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars at para 1(o).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1269 at pp 20 – 21.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Striking Out","Family Law – Procedure – Res Judicata","Family Law – Procedure – Inherent Power","Family Law – Procedure – Abuse of Process","Family Law – Procedure – Judicial Interviews"],"date":"2024-06-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2741 of 2020 (Summons No 1298 of 2024)","title":"WYV v WYW","citation":"[2024] SGFC 44","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31695-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Sarah-Mae Thomas and Larissa Mira Balmadres (Sarah-Mae Thomas LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYV v WYW</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYV <em>v</em> WYW </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31695-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 44</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Prior to the hearing, counsel for the Father, Ms Sarah-Mae Thomas (“Ms Thomas”), had written in to request that the application for striking out in SUM 1298 of 2024 (“SUM 1298”) be placed before DJ Amy Tung (“DJ Tung”). At the start of the hearing, Ms Thomas confirmed that she wanted to proceed with her request for SUM 1298 to be heard by DJ Tung. She argued that this was because DJ Tung was familiar with the background of the case, having heard a previous related matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In response, the Mother, who was self-represented, argued that the hearing should proceed as planned. There was no reason why the hearing should be vacated and refixed. The choice of judge should not be a consideration in deciding whether to vacate and refix the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I saw no reason to vacate the hearing and to refix matters before DJ Tung. Parties had turned up for the hearing before me fully prepared to ventilate their arguments. Vacating the hearing would only result in further delays. I therefore proceeded to hear arguments from both parties in respect of SUM 1298.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Procedural Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I begin by briefly sketching out the procedural history to this matter. The Mother had filed for divorce on 6 July 2020. Almost 2 years later, proceedings drew to a close when orders in respect of the ancillary matters were made by DJ Clement Yong (“DJ Yong”) on 22 March 2022 and extracted in FC/ORC 2826/2022 (“ORC 2826”) on 16 June 2022. That order provided, amongst other things, that the Mother would have care and control of the two children of the marriage (a daughter and a son), and that the Father would have access. The order sketched out the terms of the Father’s access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 21 June 2022, the Father applied, in SUM 1963/2022 (“SUM 1963”) to vary ORC 2826. The Father essentially sought to vary the orders relating to care and control of the children, as well as access. The Mother had also taken out an application for enforcement of maintenance orders in MSS 1384/2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Both MSS 1384 and SUM 1963 were before DJ Tung. However, SUM 1963 was only heard much later, on 13 March 2023, where DJ Tung varied the access orders to deal with the scenario of the Father’s relocation overseas, as well as inconsistencies between clauses 8 and 11 of ORC 2826. The reason for this was that it had been alleged that the Father had sexually abused the children. As a result, CPS had been involved, and child protection proceedings were commenced in the Youth Court. Criminal investigations were also conducted. This meant that SUM 1963 was put on hold. DJ Tung, who heard the Mother’s application in MSS 1384, had explained this in her written grounds in respect of MSS 1384 – that as a matter of case management, the child protection proceedings which were on-going had to be completed before any orders on issues relating to the children could be made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Subsequently, CPS, upon concluding their investigations, withdrew the proceedings in the Youth Court. Counsel informed the court of this at the case conference held on 21 February 2023. A week later, on 28 February 2023, the police informed the Father that they had concluded their investigations and were taking no further action against the Father. Ms Thomas had written in to inform the court of this development on 7 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     This cleared the way for the hearing, and disposal of SUM 1963. The orders made by DJ Tung in respect of SUM 1963 are contained in FC/ORC 1792/2023 (“ORC 1792”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The conclusion of SUM 1963, however, was not the end of this saga. On 21 March 2024, the Mother took out SUM 893/2024 (“SUM 893”) to vary clause 13A(b) of ORC 1792. That clause read:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">If the Defendant visits Singapore for a shorter period of two weeks or less, he shall be at liberty to exercise dinner access during weekdays between 3pm to 8pm and one full overnight weekend access per calendar week that he visits. The Defendant shall give the Plaintiff at least 2 weeks’ notice in advance of his intended visit to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother sought, in SUM 893, to exclude the children from having overnight access with the Father. The reason for this, as she had set out in her supporting affidavit, was to put in place the “necessary security and protection measures” to “ensure the safety” of both children who were still vulnerable. The Mother cited the allegations that the Father had sexually abused the children, as well as the resulting actions taken by CPS to investigate these allegations and the commencement of child protection proceedings in the Youth Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In response, the Father took out the present application to strike out SUM 893. I turn now to set out the arguments he has advanced in support of his application, as well as the Mother’s arguments in response.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Arguments </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father seeks to strike out SUM 893 on three grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     First, that SUM 893 is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious because it has no substantive merit. It is, according to the Father, clear from the Mother’s affidavit that there has not been any material change in circumstances which warrant the further variation that the Mother seeks. That is because all of the incidents and allegations, save one, raised by the Mother in support of her application in SUM 893 had already been raised in the previous proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As for the sole incident which was not covered in previous proceedings, that related to access arrangements between the Father and the son during the Father’s visit to Singapore in December 2023. There had, apparently been some difficulties as the Mother alleged that the Father did not liaise with her on the access arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Father argues that, in any event, the Mother has not explained how this amounts to a material change in circumstances that warrants the variation sought by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Apart from the point that SUM 893 has no substantive merit, given that nothing new of substance had transpired since ORC 1792 was made, the Father also argues that the Mother had a collateral purpose in bringing SUM 893 – and that was to shield herself from any potential enforcement proceedings that the Father might bring. The Father points out that the Mother was in breach of the court orders that had been made given that he had no digital or physical access to his daughter, or any overnight access to both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Finally, the Father also argues that the Mother is using SUM 893 to obstruct his access to the children by making baseless allegations of concerns for the children’s safety. This is because SINDA, which had been facilitating access arrangements, was now stepping down its services in or around June or July 2024. This means that the Father will now have to liaise personally with the Mother on access arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The second principal argument which the Father advances is that SUM 893 is an abuse of process. The Father, once again, asserts that the Mother is using SUM 893 as a means to avoid any attempts by him to enforce the court order and also to obstruct his access to the children. He argues that the situation in the present case falls squarely within the second category of an “abuse of process” as defined by the court in <em>Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/49313-M.xml')\">[2005] SGHC 216</a> (“<em>Chee Siok Chin</em>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Insofar as the Mother continues to rely on the allegations of sexual abuse to support her application in SUM 893, the Father says that that too falls within the fourth category of an abuse of process as defined by the court in <em>Chee Siok Chin</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> If SUM 893 is not struck out, the Father will have to defend himself in court again even though the allegations of sexual abuse have already been thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the relevant authorities.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Third, that the court should, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, strike out SUM 893 as it is <em>res judicata</em>. I pause here to note that while the Father seeks to invoke the court’s “inherent jurisdiction”, what he is really referring to is the court’s inherent <em>power</em>: <em>Siva Kumar s/o Avadiar v Quek Leng Chuang and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25773-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 451</a> at [42] citing <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0258.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 258</a> (“<em>Re Nalpon</em>”) at [29] and [32] and <em>Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah and other applications</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1990] 2 SLR(R) 0348.xml')\">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 348</a> at [19], [29] – [31]; see also Goh Yihan, “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent Powers of the Singapore Courts: Rethinking the Limits of their Exercise” [2011] SJLS 178.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, which the Father also relies on, that is a “portmanteau term used to describe a number of different legal principles with different juridical origins” – broadly speaking, however, it comprises three distinct but interrelated principles: a) cause of action estoppel, b) issue estoppel, and c) the “extended” doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>: <em>The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18226-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 1104</a> at [98] citing <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0453.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</a> (“<em>Goh Nellie</em>”) at [17]–[25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In the present case, the Father argues that SUM 893 is <em>res judicata</em> on the basis of issue estoppel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In particular, the Father highlights that the factual substratum of the Mother’s application in SUM 893 had already been dealt with when the original ancillary orders had been made (ORC 2826) and when those orders had been varied (ORC 1792). The Mother simply cannot be allowed to re-litigate the matter of the Father’s access “based on allegations that have already been tried and tested until she finally obtains a finding of fact” or a decision in her favour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother, on the other hand, made the following arguments in response during the hearing. First, that the allegations of sexual abuse had not, contrary to the Father’s arguments, been dealt with during the previous hearings. For instance, DJ Yong, who had heard the ancillary matters merely raised the issue – the investigation into those allegations only took place <em>after</em> the hearing of the ancillary matters. Where SUM 1963 was concerned, that was not her application, and so she had no opportunity to ask for a variation of the orders in relation to the Father’s overnight access. In any event, the focus of SUM 1963 was never on the allegations of sexual abuse, which formed the pith and marrow of the proceedings commenced by CPS in the Youth Court, and so had never been squarely dealt with by DJ Tung.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother also made the point that she had taken out SUM 893 for the sake of the children, in particular, the daughter. She argued that the views of the children should be taken into account in deciding whether SUM 893 should be struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on Striking Out and Variation of Access Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The court’s power to strike out an application is “derived from Rule 405 [of the FJR 2014] and the inherent powers of court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the court”: <em>VMI v VMJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25266-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 95</a> at [14] citing Rule 985 of the FJR 2014 and <em>Singapore Court Practice 2017</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2017) at [18/19/1]. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Rule 405 of the FJR 2014 states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Striking out pleadings and endorsements</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">405.—(1)    The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)    it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In addition to an order made under paragraph (1), the Court may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(<em>a</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    This rule shall, as far as applicable, apply to an originating summons as if it were a pleading.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Because Rule 405 is derived from Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of Court 2014 (Cap 322 R 5) (“ROC 2014”), the principles sketched out in relation to O 18 r 19 are also relevant: <em>VHP v VHQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24436-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 40</a> at [40].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The striking out mechanism contained in Rule 405 allows the filtering out of claims where “no further investigation could provide any appreciable assistance to the task of reaching a correct outcome” thereby “avoiding the full costs of legal proceedings”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, Family Procedure in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2018) (“<em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em>”) at [405.01].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the case before me involved the striking out of an originating summons: Rule 41(2) of the FJR 2014. In this connection, Rule 405(4) provides that the striking out mechanism shall apply to an originating summons as if it were a pleading. What this means is that in considering the Father’s application to strike out, the two important things which I must consider are the prayers set out in SUM 893, as well as the evidence which the Mother has provided in her supporting affidavit (see <em>eg</em>: <em>Re Jazzgold Ltd</em> [1994] 1 BCLC 38 at 43 – 45 citing Megarry VC in <em>Knapman v Servain, Re Caines (decd)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/13508-E-M.xml')\">[1978] 1 WLR 540</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It must be emphasised that the threshold for striking out is a high one and the court will only exercise its power to strike out in plain and obvious cases. Apart from striking out, the court may also allow the party to amend its pleadings: <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> at [405.02].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In an application for striking out, it is good practice for an applicant to precisely “correlate the arguments it advances to the <em>exact limb</em> under” Rule 405 which it seeks to rely on. Doing so would allow the court to better understand and assess the thrust of the applicant’s arguments. This is especially since each limb under Rule 405 is conceptually distinct and serves a specific purpose in relation to the court’s power to strike out a claim, notwithstanding the fact that there are similarities and overlaps between each limb: <em>The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0546.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 546</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father has specified that he is relying on Rules 405(1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>d</em>) to strike out the Mother’s application. To succeed in his application, he bears the onus of showing that the Mother’s application is either scandalous, frivolous and vexatious within the meaning of Rule 405(1)(<em>b</em>) or that it is an abuse of process within the meaning of Rule 405(1)(<em>d</em>): see <em>Terrestrial Pte Ltd v Allgo Marine Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0527.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 527</a> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In that connection, the cases are clear that the word “scandalous” in Rule 405(1)(<em>b</em>) refers to the “general jurisdiction of the court to expunge scandalous matter in any record or proceeding”: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</em> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<em>White Book</em>”) at [18/19/11]. For example, allegations of dishonesty or outrageous conduct are scandalous if they are not relevant to the issue: see <em>White Book</em> at [18/19/11] citing <em>Evernett v Prythergch</em> [1841] 12 Sim. 363; <em>Rubery v Grant</em> [1872] L.R. 13 Eq. 443.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As to what comprises “frivolous or vexatious” as set out in Rule 405(1)(<em>b</em>), the authorities have defined it as referring to cases which are “obviously unsustainable”. In other words, the pleading must be “so clearly frivolous that to put it forward would be an abuse of the process of the court”: <em>White Book</em> at [18/19/12] citing Jeune P. in <em>Young v Holloway</em> [1895] P 87 at 90. In this vein, it is said that a pleading is obviously unsustainable if it is: <b>a)</b> clear, as a matter of law, that the party will not prevail even if he succeeds in proving all the facts, or <b>b)</b> that there is no factual basis for the claim that has been advanced: <em>Ok Tedi Fly River Development Foundation Ltd and others v Ok Tedi Mining Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29907-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 3 SLR 652</a> at [54].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     When considering this ground, the court can have regard to the history of the matter, as well as the relevant correspondence exchanged between the parties in addition to the pleadings: <em>Trinity Construction Development Pte Ltd v Sinohydro Corp Ltd (Singapore Branch)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25912-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 1039</a> at [14] citing <em>Active Timber Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen &amp; Gledhill</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1995] 3 SLR(R) 0334.xml')\">[1995] 3 SLR(R) 334</a> at [21]–[22], citing <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek Kiau</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1990] 2 SLR(R) 0705.xml')\">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 705</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, insofar as Rule 405(1)(<em>d</em>) is concerned, this rule “confers upon the court in express terms powers which the court has hitherto exercised under its inherent jurisdiction where there appeared to be an abuse of process of the court”. The rationale for this is that court processes must be used <em>bona</em> fide, and the court will act to prevent the use of its machinery as a tool of vexation and oppression in the course of litigation: <em>White Book</em> at [18/19/14]; <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0649.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In assessing whether SUM 893 is an abuse of process, the approach to be taken is that of a “broad, merits-based judgment” – a balance must be struck between the “demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press [their] case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant”: <em>Chia Kok Kee v Tan Wah and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0352.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 352</a> at [30] citing <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0453.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453</a> (“<em>Goh Nellie</em>”) at [53]. An example of what constitutes an abuse of process can be found in <em>Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel v Housing and Development Board</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30587-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGDC 250</a> at [61(e)] – there, the court ruled that an originating summons which fell outside of the District Court’s jurisdiction would qualify as an abuse of process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Apart from the two grounds of striking out which the Father relies on, he is also arguing that the court should invoke its inherent power to strike out SUM 893 on the basis of issue estoppel. As the court in <em>Goh Nellie</em> explained (at [18]), if a “previous decision does not determine the cause of action sued on in the later proceedings, that decision may still be invoked as having determined, as an essential step in its reasoning, an issue that proves relevant in the later case and further consideration of that issue may be foreclosed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Apart from the principles on striking out, the principles on the variation of access orders are also relevant given that the Mother has sought, in SUM 893, to further vary the access orders made in ORC 1972. These principles had been recently summarised in the decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court in <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> at [14] – [19]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    We begin with a summary of the principles governing an application for variation of orders relating to children. The starting point is in s 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“WC”), which provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    In <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (“<em>AZB</em>”), the court held that in respect of orders relating to the child, <b>the determination of any material change in circumstances requires “a principled and pragmatic approach” that considers the welfare of a child and that s 128 of the WC should not be read too narrowly</b> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Relationships are dynamic. A parent who is not emotionally close to a child at the time an access order is made may, through time, build a much closer relationship with the child subsequently. For example, a young three-year old child may have been clingy to his mother at the time the court orders care and control to the mother and limited access to the father. As the child grows older and builds a closer relationship with his father, it may be in his welfare to encourage increased access when he is, say, five years old. The child may have outgrown the phase of high dependence on and clinginess to his mother. There may not have been any one particular identifiable event that marks a material change in circumstances between the time he was three and five years old, but because relationships are dynamic, circumstances may have sufficiently changed such that a variation is warranted for his welfare. Hence, the court ought not to read s 128 of the Women’s Charter too narrowly, but should take both a principled and pragmatic approach to the determination of a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    We hasten to add that <b>in determining whether a material change in circumstances exists for the purposes of s 128 of the WC, the court is required to balance several interests</b>. This includes on the one hand, <b>the need for stability in carrying out orders and establishing the post-divorce routine for the child over a reasonable period of time, and on the other, the need to be responsive to new developments</b>. As to the former consideration, we recognise that it is not desirable for the parties and their children to be “in limbo”, where constant applications for variation result in uncertainty for the children and keeps the family in the “litigation box” even before there has been sufficient time for the new arrangements to be carried out or for routines to be set up. As to the latter consideration, we are cognisant that the parent-child relationship is dynamic, especially since children have new needs and preferences as they grow older. Thus, the court must also ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances facing the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17    The upshot of these competing interests is that <b>while the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child, this should not encourage parties to pursue a variation of orders at the earliest opportunity</b>. Instead, <b>the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work</b>. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements”: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<em>TAU</em>”) (at [10]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18    Parents should, in considering their children’s changing needs, exercise grace and flexibility in co-parenting and make arrangements in the best interests of their children. Applications for custody, care and control and access should not be weaponised as tools to control or hurt the other spouse. In this regard, the observations by the Family Division of the High Court in <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> (at [22]) bear repeating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… It might well be that the future holds new needs for that child, and further adjustments in living arrangements will be required to meet those needs. Should that come to pass, the appropriate way forward would be for the parents, who know their child best and love her most deeply, to work out these parenting matters. They can reach out for therapeutic support or mediation services if they would like assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19     <b>Instead of litigating in the courts for the variation of orders, parents should endeavour to make adjustments by agreement to the care and access orders where necessary</b>. This is the essence of TJ, which seeks to support parents in their journey of healing and moving forward by adopting a problem-solving approach instead of an adversarial one: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (“<em>VVB</em>”) (at [24]). We stress that TJ involves a measure of sacrifice and compromise – it requires each party to take responsibility where required, refrain from inflaming the situation, let go of what has hurt them deeply, and recast the future: <em>VVB</em> at [27]. A kind act begets a kind response while a nasty act inflames the hurt and sets back the healing. While the court remains accessible to parties who require a resolution to disputes that they are unable to resolve despite their best efforts, we stress that this course of action should be the last resort and reiterate the remarks by the Family Division of the High Court in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [47]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… if parents file court proceedings for variation each time there is a change, there is something precious that we will have lost in our society made up of family units, for parenting is to be carried out cooperatively by parents themselves. Parents must find the resolve to overcome the difficulties in co-parenting by a strong commitment to discharging their parental responsibility. Litigation has harmful effects on the child – materially, because the family loses in incurring litigation expenses, and psychologically, because conflict affects the whole family in ways not easily visible. [italics in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     It must also be emphasised that if the ground relied on for variation is that there has been a material change in circumstances, such a variation will only be made if there has been such a change since the order made by the court. That is implicit in the expectation that the parents must endeavour to make adjustments to orders for care and access by agreement where necessary, instead of litigating in the courts. An application for variation should be a tool of last resort. If a party applies for a variation of an order based on a material change in circumstances, they bear the burden of proving such a change: see <em>APK v APL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 255</a> (“<em>APK</em>”) at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">SUM 893 shall be struck out</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Having considered the oral and written arguments made by parties, I strike out the Mother’s application in SUM 893. I do so because it is clear to me, having read the Mother’s supporting affidavit in SUM 893, as well as considering the history of the case before me, that insofar as the Mother appears to rely on there being a material change in circumstances within the meaning of s 128 of the Women’s Charter 1961 since ORC 1972, there was, in my judgment, no such change that would warrant a further variation of the access order that had been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I take, as my starting point, what the Mother had said her supporting affidavit for SUM 893. She explained that she had applied for a further variation of the access orders because she wanted to put in place “the necessary security and protection measures” to ensure the safety of the children “who are still vulnerable”. In particular, she wanted to protect the daughter’s “mental well-being and self-esteem” in the belief that she should decide when she is ready to spend time with the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The basis for this, as the Mother explains, stems, in essence, from the allegations of sexual abuse, and the events that followed thereafter which included CPS being involved, the investigations by both CPS and the police, and the subsequent application made by CPS to the Youth Court along with the interim measures which had been put in place to protect the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Although the Mother had referred to some difficulties in the arrangements for the Father’s access when he came back to Singapore in 2023, this does not appear to be the basis of her application in SUM 893. As I understood it, from the arguments which the Mother had advanced at the hearing, her basis for taking out SUM 893 was the allegations of sexual abuse and her desire to protect the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     There are, as I set out below, several major problems with the Mother’s application in SUM 893 that warrant it being struck out, either on the basis of Rule 405(1)(<em>b</em>) or (<em>d</em>), or in the exercise of the court’s inherent powers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The first is that insofar as she is relying on the allegations of sexual abuse to seek a further variation of ORC 1792 on the basis that the children needed to be protected, the police had conducted their investigations and in consultation with the Attorney General’s Chambers (“AGC”), decided that no further action would be taken. The Mother had been informed of this in a letter from the police dated 1 March 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Mother argued, during the hearing before me, that this letter from the police did not mean that the Father had been cleared of all charges or misconduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I could not accept this argument. There are four courses of action that can be taken upon the conclusion of investigations into a possible criminal offence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     to prosecute,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to issue a conditional warning,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     to issue a stern warning, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     to take no further action.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     When it is said that no further action shall be taken, what this means is that the investigations had revealed that there was either no evidence, or that there was insufficient evidence to establish that an offence had indeed been committed. In other words, the Father had indeed been cleared of all charges and misconduct by the police and AGC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In this vein, it is also telling that CPS had also withdrawn its application in the Youth Court, and stated that it was satisfied that the care and protection concerns with respect to the children had been sufficiently addressed, having considered the outcome of the police investigations as well as its own social investigations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Taken together, what this means is that the Mother has no factual basis on which to argue that ORC 1792 should be varied. The allegations of sexual abuse which she relies on must also be considered against the outcome of the investigations conducted by the police and CPS from which it would be clear that these allegations have no merit. It was thus clear to me that the Mother’s application in SUM 893 was either frivolous or vexatious within the meaning of Rule 405(1)(<em>b</em>) (see above at [36]), or an abuse of process, within the meaning of Rule 405(1)(<em>d</em>) (see above at [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Mother made one other point during the hearing – that although charges were not brought against the Father, this did not mean that he had not committed any misdeeds. This argument is premised on the fact that our criminal justice system is designed to prove legal guilt and not factual innocence: see Chan Sek Keong, “The Criminal Process – The Singapore Model” [1996] 17 Singapore Law Review 431. In essence, what the Mother appeared to be implying was that the police and AGC had merely taken the view that the evidence was insufficient to prove, in court, that an offence had indeed been committed. There might still be <em>some</em> substance to the allegations, and this would be enough to ground her application in SUM 893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I could not accept this argument. Even taking into account this distinction between what lawyers call “legal” and “factual” guilt, it must also be remembered that CPS had conducted their own investigations. In that vein, it is telling that CPS had decided to discontinue proceedings in the Youth Court. In light of this, I did not think that it was open to the Mother to assert that there might still be <em>some</em> substance to the allegations. The result of police investigations as well as CPS’s decision to withdraw proceedings in the Youth Court must be, in my view, taken as being conclusive as to the allegations of sexual abuse in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In any event, I must emphasise that the Mother has not, in her supporting affidavit for SUM 893, raised any <b><em>fresh</em></b> allegations, nor has she referred to any new developments since ORC 1792 had been made. In short: it is abundantly clear that the Mother has not put forth evidence which even suggests that there has been a material change in circumstances since the hearing of SUM 1963. As such, SUM 893 is indeed, as I had pointed out above (at [53]), either frivolous or vexatious, or and abuse of process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Apart from the reasons I have set out above, it was also clear to me that SUM 893 should be struck out on the basis that it is an abuse of process. SUM 893 was, in my judgment, a backdoor appeal against the orders which DJ Tung had made. That much is apparent from the procedural history of the matter, which I set out in detail below. It will also be apparent from this narrative as to why I could not accept the Father’s arguments that issue estoppel applied in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I begin with the hearing of the ancillary matters. Insofar as that hearing was concerned, the Father had argued, in his written submissions, that the court should disregard the allegations of sexual abuse which the Mother had raised in her affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> During the hearing of the ancillary matters, DJ Yong had asked counsel for both the Father and the Mother, to address him on the allegations of sexual abuse:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Court:    … Yes, another point--- okay, so now, I go back to overnight access. Okay. When I was going through the documents earlier, I saw---it might be a proof of---it might be from the Defendant’s submissions where it was your reply to the Plaintiff’s allegation that the father showered with the children and played with his private parts. So, that is a serious allegation, so I want to---and this is something that I have to make a finding of fact on, like whether this actually happened or not. So, I will hear parties’ submission on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Counsel for the Mother had explained that these allegations were something which the Mother had affirmed in her affidavit, but had no further documents to back up her claim. It was also argued that the Father had made allegations about the Mother’s alleged partner, but DJ Yong had explained that it was not relevant because the issue was whether the Father could be trusted to be with the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In response, Ms Thomas, had made the point that if there was some substance to these allegations, then one would expect that they would be made contemporaneously, yet no such report had been made. Ms Thomas had also argued that while it was alleged that the Father had sexually abused the children in 2020, overnight access had still taken place – any mother who was “genuinely trying to protect her children would stop immediate overnight access…if these allegations were indeed true”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In rendering his judgment on the children’s issues, DJ Yong had ordered joint custody, and explained that he had done so because there “was no evidence of any abuse”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It is therefore clear that DJ Yong had considered the allegations of abuse, and made a finding on the available evidence before him. In so doing, DJ Yong had seen fit to allow the Father overnight access, and this is reflected in clause 6 of ORC 2826:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Beginning from 2023, the Defendant shall have overnight access to the Children from Friday 7:30 PM to Saturday 7:30 PM, alternating with Saturday 7:30 PM to Sunday 7:30 PM the following week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother, however, points out that at the hearing of the ancillary matters, both the CPS as well as the police had not been involved. It was only after the hearing of the ancillary matters that the police report was made, and investigations were conducted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In response, Ms Thomas accepted that while both the CPS as well as the police were only involved after the ancillary matters hearing, the result of the ensuing investigations had been duly considered by DJ Tung in the hearing of SUM 1963.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I could not agree with the point made by Ms Thomas. I did not think that these allegations of sexual abuse were the focus of SUM 1963.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In respect of SUM 1963, the Father had, in the course of his written submissions, argued that there was a material change in circumstances justifying a variation of ORC 2826. The Father had, in that vein, made reference to the allegations of sexual abuse, the decision by CPS to discontinue proceeding in the Youth Court as well as the decision by police to take no further action against him. That said, it is clear that the relief which the Father sought in SUM 1963 was for greater access to the children, taking into account the fact that he was residing outside of Singapore. The Father also sought for access orders to provide for a situation where he was residing in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In response, the Mother had argued in her written submissions that there had been no material change in circumstances justifying a variation of ORC 2826. In particular, although she continued to rely on the allegations of sexual abuse as a reason for denying the Father’s application to vary ORC 2826, it bears emphasising that she did not raise any specific objections to the overnight access which the Father had been granted in ORC 2826.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     At the hearing of SUM 1963 on 13 March 2023, DJ Tung observed that DJ Yong’s order was premised on the fact that the Father was residing in Singapore. At that hearing, parties crossed swords on the details of the revised access arrangements which the Father was seeking. While there was no mention of the allegations of sexual abuse, counsel for the Mother had highlighted that if the Father was allowed to bring the children on overseas trips, the Mother wanted daily video calls with the children as she was very worried about their safety. It bears noting that counsel for the Mother did not, at the final hearing of SUM 1963, object to the Father having overnight access to the children. When DJ Tung issued her decision in respect of SUM 1963, she allowed the variation of the access orders to provide for a situation where the Father was based outside of Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Mother thus had a point when she argued that what DJ Tung had actually dealt with was the Father’s application to vary the access orders in the event that he relocated overseas. However, insofar as the Mother had argued before me that DJ Tung did not actually deal with matters of overnight access, and that she had no opportunity to ask for a variation of the access orders because it was not her application, it must be noted, and emphasised, that the Mother, who was represented at SUM 1963, never raised that issue in either oral or written submissions nor did she file an appeal against DJ Tung’s decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     That the Mother raised no quarrel with the issue of overnight access during the hearing of SUM 1963 was, in my view, rather odd. That was because it was evident to me, based on the arguments which the Mother had advanced during the hearing before me, that her reason for filing SUM 893 was that she was dissatisfied with the access orders that had been made by DJ Tung.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I had therefore, during the hearing, asked the Mother why she had not filed an appeal if she was indeed unhappy with the access orders which DJ Tung had made. I explained to her that she should not disclose any information which was legally privileged given that she had been advised and represented by counsel at the hearing of SUM 1963.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The Mother explained that she did not file an appeal because she was unaware that she had such an option. She said that her counsel, which had been appointed by the Legal Aid Bureau to represent her in SUM 1963, had merely given her the court order and they had parted ways thereafter. She also says that she would have filed an appeal had she known that that was an option.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Given the circumstances and the shape of the proceedings that had taken place, I could not accept the Mother’s explanation. Her quarrel with ORC 1792 which formed the basis of her application in SUM 893 was the fact that the Father had been granted overnight access to the children. Her concern, as she explained, is founded on concerns for the children’s safety. One might expect that a parent, in a similar situation, with the same concerns, would act with a little more haste. It is therefore curious that the Mother only filed SUM 893 on 21 March 2024, which was almost a year <b><em>after</em></b> DJ Amy Tung had issued her decision in respect of SUM 1963. As to why this was the case, the Mother provided no explanation, nor can any explanation be found in both her supporting affidavit for SUM 893 as well as her reply affidavit to SUM 1298.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The only conclusion which I can draw is that SUM 893 is a backdoor appeal against the orders made in ORC 1972. I will emphasise that if parties are dissatisfied with orders that had been made, the proper thing to do is to file an appeal. They cannot sit on their hands and apply for a variation of that order long after the time limit in which an appeal may be filed has passed. Doing so would, as the Court of Appeal in <em>TQU v TQT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27065-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 5</a> (at [2]) observed, amount to an abuse of the process of the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     For completeness, I would add that I had proceeded on the basis that the Mother was basing SUM 893 on there being a material change in circumstances that warranted a further variation of the access order. It was apparent to me, from her affidavit filed in support of SUM 893, that she was not asking for variation of the access orders on the basis of misrepresentation or a mistake of fact. However, even if SUM 893 had been based on those grounds, I would still have struck out the Mother’s application for the reasons I have set out above – namely that there is no factual basis for her application, and in any event, SUM 893 is an abuse of the process of the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Finally, I would add that even <em>if</em> one takes a charitable view of the Mother’s basis for SUM 893, as had been set out in her affidavit, it was clear that there was no basis for her application. During the hearing, the Mother had highlighted the fact that the views of the children should be taken into account in deciding the striking out application. She urged me to conduct a judicial interview to ascertain the wishes of the two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In this vein, I had queried parties as to whether the Mother’s supporting affidavit could be read more charitably in the sense that her application for variation was done solely for the purpose of helping the daughter improve her relationship with the Father. I had done so because the Mother’s argument that a judicial interview should be conducted suggested that apart from the allegations of sexual abuse, she may have had another basis for taking out SUM 893, although that might not have been quite well articulated in her supporting affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Ms Thomas argued that even if one read the Mother’s supporting affidavit in this way, it was clear that the daughter’s poor relationship with the Father had already been dealt with at the previous hearings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I agree with the point made by Ms Thomas. Indeed, as the Mother herself had explained during the hearing, she mentioned that the daughter had, from 2022, prior to bringing up the allegations of sexual abuse, refused to see the Father. According to the Mother, the daughter was too young to understand what court orders meant, and all that she knew was that the Father had insisted on having her, as well as her brother, stay with him overnight. The Mother had also claimed that the daughter had initiated the idea of speaking with a judge of her own volition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In short, on the Mother’s own account, that the daughter had a rocky relationship with the Father was a state of affairs which had been present since the hearing of the ancillary matters. The state of their rocky relationship had also been set out in some detail by the Mother in her reply affidavit to SUM 1963.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     As a final point, I would note that there was nothing in the Mother’s supporting affidavit for SUM 893 which disclosed that the father-daughter relationship had worsened since ORC 1792 to such an extent as to justify a further variation in the access orders. Given this, I did not see the need to conduct a judicial interview of the two children in disposing of this striking out application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     I will, however, proceed to set out, below, my reasons as to why I arrived at the conclusion that a judicial interview should not be conducted in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conducting a Judicial Interview</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     In the recent case of <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<em>WKM</em>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) noted (at [28]) that judicial interviews could be used to ascertain the wishes of the child when deciding issues relating to custody, care and control, and that the decision to conduct such an interview lay at the court’s discretion. In particular, the CA emphasised (at [45]) that in deciding whether to conduct a judicial interview, utmost sensitivity must be had to the facts of each case and the following factors must be considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">45    The assessment of whether a judicial interview should be conducted must be made with utmost sensitivity to the facts of each case. The court should be mindful of a host of factors, including, but not limited to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the age, emotional and intellectual maturity of the child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the relationship between the child’s parents and whether there are concerns about excessive gatekeeping or the conduct of one parent alienating the child from the other parent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the child’s general well-being and the consequences for the child should such an interview be conducted;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the nature of the dispute and the stage of the proceedings, including the specific matters in issue; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    the availability of other relevant material.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     As I have alluded to (above at [79]), the nature of the proceedings before me did not justify a judicial interview being conducted. I agree with the argument advanced by Ms Thomas – that the Mother should not be allowed to plug the gaps in her case by urging the court to interview the children. In essence, SUM 893 had to be assessed based on the prayers as set out in the summons as well as the evidence which the Mother had set out in her supporting affidavit. It was not open to the Mother to shift the basis on which she had taken out SUM 893 in a bid to prevent her application from being struck out by requesting the court to interview the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Ms Thomas had also pointed out that by this stage of the proceedings, both children had been to the child guidance clinic, and already been interviewed by professionals. A judicial interview was therefore not necessary at this stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     As the CA had noted in <em>WKM</em> at [51]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">51    The court should also have regard to the stage of the proceedings and whether conducting a judicial interview at that juncture is appropriate. For example, at the earlier stages in the proceedings, material on the child’s wishes or the assessment of his or her well-being may be scarce. The court could consider at that juncture whether to speak with the child, direct child welfare reports to be submitted, appoint a child representative or proceed with a combination of these options. On the other hand, at a later stage in the proceedings, the child may have already been interviewed by a number of professionals such that it may be prudent to avoid yet another interview. These are but examples of relevant considerations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The rationale for avoiding the conduct of a judicial interview at a later stage of proceedings appears to be that, by this point, information which sheds light on the child’s wishes may already be available from the interviews which had been conducted by other professionals. In that sense, a judicial interview might not be necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     I agree with the point made by Ms Thomas. Given the fact that the children had already been interviewed, it was, in my judgment, prudent to avoid yet another interview: <em>WKM</em> (at [51]). I note, for instance, that the children had indeed been interviewed by professionals – there was a Child Protection Social Report dated 7 September 2022 (the “CPSR”) which quite clearly sheds light on the situation and relationship between both the parties and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Finally, the acrimonious relationship between the Father and the Mother as well as the general well-being of the children was another reason as to why I have declined to conduct a judicial interview. As the CA had noted in <em>WKM</em> (at [48]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    The relationship between the parents is pertinent. <b>In cases where the parents are in an acrimonious relationship, the child may be triangulated into their dispute. This gives rise to a risk that a child may also be coached or influenced by parents to express certain views to the judge.</b> In cases where there is evidence that a parent is alienating the child from the other parent, the child may only express the views of that parent. Where some alienating conduct is apparent, a judicial interview may provide a useful opportunity for the judge to explain to the child that the court’s role is to make orders in the child’s best interests, and this would, in many cases, include ensuring that each parent is able to play a part in the child’s life: see Nicholas Bala et al, “Children’s Voices in Family Court: Guidelines for Judges Meeting Children” (2013) 47(3) Family Law Quarterly 379 (“Children’s Voices”) at 399. In cases where the parents are at total loggerheads, it may be that the “answer … lie[s] with the child’s perspective”: Fiona E Raitt, “Hearing Children in Family Law Proceedings: Can Judges Make a Difference?” (2007) 19(2) Child and Family Law Quarterly 204 at 208. There may be cases where a child’s voice is effectively drowned out by the cacophony of his or her parent’s self-interested proclamations of their view of where the child’s best interests lie.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">49    The child’s general well-being should of course be taken into account. <b>The court should consider whether the child may suffer any adverse emotional consequences arising from the conduct of a judicial interview. Considerations include whether the parents are likely to place pressure on the child to take a certain position during the interview, or whether the child has already participated in too many interviews with different professionals.</b> A child may have also expressed aversion to being embroiled in court processes (for example, see <em>UBQ</em> ([35] supra)) or expressed worries that he or she may be choosing one parent over the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     It was apparent to me, from the affidavits that had been filed in this matter, as well as those filed in SUM 1963 and for the hearing of the ancillary matters, that the Father and Mother had an acrimonious relationship and that there was indeed a risk of the children being triangulated into their dispute. This very risk had <em>also</em> been highlighted in the CPSR. That report had expressed the concern that the children would be psychologically impacted by their parents’ ongoing conflict in the long run if they are made to choose sides. In this vein, I note that the daughter is 10 years old, and the son is 9 years old. They are both still in their developmental years, and will, more than anything else, need the care, love and guidance from <b>both</b> their parents, instead of being forced to choose between them. While the Mother had mentioned that the daughter had floated the idea of speaking to a judge of her own volition, I placed very little weight on this given that there was nothing else to corroborate this, and the risk posed to the children from being caught up in the conflict between their parents which had been highlighted in the CPSR report. It also bears noting that DJ Tung had, in her decision in respect of MSS 1384, observed that the parties were “embroiled in deep conflict” with each claiming that the other had caused “him or her and the children great harm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     I thus considered that the conduct of a judicial interview in deciding whether SUM 893 should be struck out could well place the children in the unenviable position of being forced to choose one parent over the other. The innocence of a child should not be lost to their parents’ battles in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     For the reasons which I have set out above, I decline to conduct a judicial interview in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     I therefore allow the Father’s application in SUM 1298 and order that the Mother’s application in SUM 893 be struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     On this final note, I would strongly encourage both the Mother, as well as the Father, to set aside their differences, look past their hurt, and to try to work together in the best interests of their children.

The 14-year-old elder daughter had cut her wrists, had brought a penknife to school on the instructions of the mother, and had been exposed to pornography. The 11-year-old younger daughter had, apart from similarly cutting her wrists and consuming pornography, threatened and beat up the mother. The 11-year-old son had scalded himself at home following inadequate parental supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parents of the children diverged in their views on this application. The father consented to the CPOs. The mother objected to the CPOs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I agreed with the Child Protector that the children were in need of care and protection, and that the CPOs sought were in their welfare and best interests. The elder daughter and the younger daughter were committed to places of safety, Chen Su Lan Methodist Children's Home (“CSL”) and the Interim Placement and Assessment Centre, Marymount (“IPAC”) respectively. The son was placed under the supervision of an approved welfare officer (“AWO”), even as he remained in the care of the mother. With a view to re-integrating the children with their parents, I limited the duration of the CPOs to 12 months, with a review in 6 months. I also ordered the parents to work with the professionals and other allied services to improve their parenting abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The mother is dissatisfied with these decisions and has filed an appeal against them. I now provide my grounds for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 19 July 2021, the parents of the children divorced. The care and control of the children was awarded to the mother while access to the children was granted to the father. The children thus lived with the mother from day to day but saw the father frequently across his regular access sessions with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 19 September 2022, the daughters’ school made a report to the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline. The school claimed that the mother had dragged the elder daughter by the hair across their residence and hit her on the head repeatedly. It added that the elder daughter had brought a penknife to school and had threatened her classmates. It also reported that both daughters had been exposed to pornography. These reports were referred to the Child Protective Services (the “CPS”), which requested the children’s schools to monitor them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 27 April 2023, the son’s school reported that the son had scalded himself on the thigh. On 11 August 2023, the daughters’ school reported that the younger daughter had burnt herself while cooking and that she had been hit with a backscratcher by the elder daughter. The schools also expressed concern that the mother had coached the children to downplay the events that had taken place at home. And on 30 August 2023, the son’s school reported that the son had sustained a bruise due to the elder daughter hitting him. In consequence, the CPS commenced further investigations into the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 14 September 2023, burn marks were found on the arm of the elder daughter during a visit to her school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The CPS then exercised its powers under s 11 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”) to admit the children to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”) for medical examination and for their temporary care and protection. The CPS also applied to the Youth Court for the CPOs in respect of the children that were the subject of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 18 September 2023, the CPS produced the children before the Youth Court, which made interim orders that committed the children to places of temporary care and protection pending the final determination of the CPOs. Pursuant to these orders, the children were committed to KKH and/or Gladiolus Place. At the same time, the CPS engaged the parents on addressing the concerns in respect of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 11 October 2023, the parents and the CPS agreed on a safety plan on the care of the children pending the final determination of the CPOs. Pursuant to this safety plan, the parents undertook to “use only safe methods of parenting to manage children (i.e. verbal instructions, removal of privileges, reward and praises for good behaviour)” and to “avoid any use of physical punishment (i.e. any form of physical contacts that causes pain that is not accidental regardless of purpose) at all times”. The parents also undertook to “attend relevant services (e.g. co-parenting counselling services, school counselling, family service centre, mental health assessment and follow-up services, if recommended) as identified by [the] CPS”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the CPS returned the younger daughter and the son to the care of the mother while elder daughter continued to reside in KKH pending the conclusion of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 23 October 2023, the Youth Court granted further interim orders. These further orders extended the placement of the elder daughter at KKH and that placed the younger daughter and the son under the supervision of an AWO welfare officer even as they remained in the care of the mother. The Youth Court also made directions for the hearing and determination of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 13 December 2023, the Youth Court fixed these proceedings for hearing on 6 February 2024. The interim orders were likewise extended, save that the elder daughter was placed at CSL instead of KKH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 22 December 2023, the mother filed a police report in respect of the younger daughter, who had then been in her care. She alleged that the younger daughter had threatened her and beat her up. The police attended at the scene and found a scar consistent with self-harm on the wrist of the younger daughter. They took the younger daughter to the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), which warded the younger daughter for assessment. The younger daughter was eventually discharged on 8 January 2024 and resided at IPAC thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     On 22 January 2023, the Youth Court made further directions in response to these developments and fixed these proceedings for hearing on 2 April 2024. The interim orders were likewise extended, save that the younger daughter was removed from the care of the mother and placed at IPAC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The CPS submitted that the children were in need of care and protection on several grounds within s 5(1) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For the elder daughter, the CPS submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That she had not been properly supervised and controlled, and was exposed to moral danger under s 5(1)(c)(ii) of the CYPA because she was exposed to pornography while in the care of the mother and had even introduced the younger daughter to pornography;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That she was at risk of ill-treatment by the mother under s 5(1)(d)(i) of the CYPA because the mother was using excessive and harsh physical punishment on her;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That she was behaving in a manner that was likely to be harmful to herself and others under s 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA because she had cut her wrists, had burnt herself while cooking at home without adult supervision, and had injured her siblings during physical altercations; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That she had been subject to emotional or psychological abuse by the mother under s 5(1)(g) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the younger daughter, the CPS submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That she had not been properly supervised and controlled, and was exposed to moral danger under s 5(1)(c)(ii) of the CYPA because she was exposed to pornography while in the care of the mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That she was behaving in a manner that was likely to be harmful to herself and others under s 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA because she had cut her wrists, had burnt herself while cooking at home without adult supervision, and had sustained injuries during physical altercations with the elder daughter; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That she had been subject to emotional or psychological abuse by the mother under s 5(1)(g) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For the son, the CPS submitted that he was behaving in a manner that was likely to be harmful to himself and others under s 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA because he had scalded himself at home following inadequate parental supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The CPS added that the welfare and best interests of the children necessitated 12-month CPOs that committed the daughters to places of temporary care and protection and subjected the son to the supervision of an AWO even as he remained in the care of the mother. The daughters faced a high risk of physical and emotional harm, and 12-month CPOs were needed to put in place interventions necessary to support the daughters and the mother with a view to their eventual re-integration. The son faced a lower risk of harm and could remain in the care of the mother even as the supervision of an AWO would help address the safety concerns that he faced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The father of the children agreed with the CPS that the welfare and best interests of the children would be served by these 12-month CPOs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The elder daughter objected to the CPO sought in respect of herself and expressed a desire to return to the care of the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The younger daughter desired to be removed from the care of the mother, save that she preferred to be committed to Gladiolus Place instead of IPAC because of the friends that she had made while at Gladiolus Place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The son agreed with the CPO sought in respect of himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The mother objected to the CPOs sought and demanded that the children be returned to her care. She flatly denied the allegations made by the CPS and asserted that the children were not in need of care and protection. She added that the CPOs sought were inconsistent with the wishes of the daughters, and that the interventions of the CPS had adversely affected the physical health, mental health, and academic performance of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Law on CPOs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Two steps apply in an application for a CPO in respect of a child. At the outset, the child must be in need of care and protection within one or more of the grounds in s 5(1) of the CYPA. If so, the court will then determine the orders to be made to ensure the safety and well-being of the child (<em>UNB v Child Protector</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22618-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1018</a> at [18] and [58]). In making this determination, the court will treat the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration and will “endeavour to obtain such information as to the family background, general conduct, home environment, school record, medical history and state of development” to enable it to deal with the matter in the best interests of the child (see s 54(13) of the CYPA).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The judicial endeavour to obtain such information may involve recourse by the court to investigative and therapeutic reports. These reports are prepared by public authorities and allied professionals, and typically include comments on the welfare of the child based on a mixture of the observations of the author about the child and the information that had been received by the author from the child or from other persons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The fact that such welfare reports may contain hearsay does not preclude their admission in proceedings in the Family Justice Courts (the “FJC”), of which the Youth Courts are a part. “Therapeutic Justice” underlies the entire approach to resolving family disputes in the FJC, and the path of family justice shaped by TJ envisions that the parties are not adversaries in court who take procedural objections to every assertion of fact. Applying the constraints of the hearsay rule in their full strictness may result in the exclusion of relevant evidence that paints a fuller picture of the family that can guide the court on the welfare and best interests of the child, which is the paramount consideration in family justice. Moreover, the authors of welfare reports are professionals who would have, in preparing their reports, engaged directly with the relevant persons involved in the life of the child and observed some of their interactions with the child. Given their expertise, they are well suited to identify issues, such as excessive gatekeeping behaviour by the parents and even possible signs of abuse. Absent good reason to doubt to objectivity of the reports or the accuracy of their contents, such welfare reports serve as useful independent accounts of the parents and the children (see <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<em>WKM</em>”) at [43], [73], and [74]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Still, the court will be mindful that the information in such welfare reports remains untested by cross-examination. The court will thus carefully consider such reports, especially where there are observations made therein that contradict the narrative presented by the parties. When such contradiction exists, the court will examine whether the observations and assessments in the reports are clearly explained and the factual bases for them (see <em>WKM</em> at [74]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Necessity for care and protection of the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I began by examining the care and protection concerns identified by the CPS and thereafter, the appropriate CPOs to be made in respect of each child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Moral danger</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I agreed with the CPS that the daughters faced moral danger given their exposure to pornography while in the care of the mother. The daughters’ school had in 2022 reported that the elder daughter had informed the school authorities that she had been watching pornography for three years. The younger daughter corroborated this report in her communications with the CPS and added that she had been introduced to pornography by the elder daughter. The younger daughter lamented that her “childhood ended” at just five years of age (which was the time when the elder daughter introduced her to pornographic websites) when “childhood should only end when 11 years old”. And the daughters offered detailed and consistent descriptions of the website addresses that they had visited and of content that they had seen. I excerpt the evidence of the CPS:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The daughters] revealed to CPS that the pornographic materials would often include violent and “scary” scenes such as kidnapping. [The daughters] were also able to detail that some of the online websites they would visit are anysex.com, boyslove.com, and pornographic manga. For example, [the younger daughter] narrated a manga to CPS where the male protagonist ejaculates pearls for the wealth of his owner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The mother argued that the daughters had not been exposed to pornography while in her care. She claimed that she had not seen the content in question and that it could not therefore have been pornographic in nature. She added that she had in any event blocked the access of the children to pornographic websites.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It was thus more likely than not that the daughters had been exposed to pornography while in the care of the mother. Given their tender ages, it was inconceivable that they could list the addresses of pornographic websites or offer detailed descriptions of the content thereon unless that they had been exposed to the same. The claim of the mother that the content could not have been pornographic because she had not seen the content was illogical and no reason to disbelieve the account of the daughters on what they had seen. The mother did not dispute the claim of the CPS, which claim was based on information from the children and the maternal grandmother, that the mother had spent most of her time in her room and had limited involvement in the daily routines of the children. In these circumstances, it was probable that the children had been exposed to pornography while in the care of the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As the CPS deposed, the exposure of the daughters to pornography, particularly the graphic and violent pornography that they had consumed, risked desensitising them to healthy emotional connections and distorting their views on relational boundaries. In the words of the younger daughter, her “childhood ended” when she was exposed to such content. Worryingly, the mother displayed little insight into these risks and little desire to better supervise the daughters: she neglected to take positive steps to steer the daughters away from pornographic content,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and instead blamed the father for buying laptops, mobile phones, and large computer screens for the daughters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The daughters were thus bereft of proper supervision and control and faced moral danger while in the care of the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Ill-treatment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I did not, however, agree with the CPS that the elder daughter had been ill-treated or was at risk of ill-treatment by the mother. According to the CPS, there had been multiple incidents of physical punishment of the elder daughter that caused her sustain bruises on the upper forehead and pain in the arms that lasted an entire week.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The CPS referred to the report of the daughters’ school that the mother had dragged the elder daughter by the hair across their residence and hit the elder daughter on the head repeatedly (see [6] above). The CPS added that the elder daughter had been distressed by the physical punishment and had sought to cope with the distress by distancing herself with her mobile phone and by playing computer games.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The mother denied so punishing the elder daughter. She added that “no child could have survived such an ordeal” and that the child “would have died on the spot”. But such hyperbole did few favours for her credibility, and she would do well to curb such extravagance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Even so, these denials were corroborated by the father. The father shared with the Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service at the Ministry of Social and Family Development (the “CFPS”) that he “did not perceive [the mother] to have mistreated [the elder daughter]” even as she “placed a strong emphasis on [the elder daughter’s] academic work”. He added that the “did not observe any noticeable injuries on [the elder daughter] and that [the elder daughter] did not shared about being physically punished by [the mother] during their regular access”. The CFPS reported that the father “impressed as a concerned parent who cared about the wellbeing of [the elder daughter]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Given the familiarity of the father with the elder daughter that had been built through regular access sessions, I accepted his account of the events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Further support for these conclusions was found in the contemporaneous welfare reports on the elder daughter. A social report prepared by the CPS on 23 October 2023 recorded “a lack of evidence that suggested [the mother] may cause immediate harm on her children” even as “protection concerns in the case remained”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The psychological report prepared by the CFPS on 14 March 2023 recorded that the elder daughter did not present with “clinically significant trauma symptoms” or “clinically significant depressive symptoms”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It was thus unclear that the elder daughter had been ill-treated or was at risk of ill-treatment by the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Harm to self and/or others</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I agreed with the CPS that the behaviour of the children, particularly the daughters, was likely to be harmful to themselves and/or others, and that the mother was unable or unwilling to remedy the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     For the daughters, the CPS gave evidence that they had cut themselves on their wrists and had injured each other (and the son) in physical altercations. The mother did not deny that the daughters had harmed themselves intentionally but asserted primarily that the daughters were no longer at risk of self-harm. The mother added that the physical altercations between the daughters were unextraordinary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     But the mere fact that the self-harm did not recur recently did not remove the risk of the daughters harming themselves. The elder daughter was found by the CFPS to present with a “lack of adaptive coping strategies” and to tend to “deny or minimise her experience of negative emotions”. Even as her current risk of self-harm and suicide was “low”, the CFPS opined that her risks “might increase when her coping is taxed (e.g. in face of academic pressures)”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The younger daughter had as recently as on 21 December 2023 informed the police that she had tried to cut her wrists.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> But the mother dismissed the younger daughter’s mentions of self-harm as a “joke”. This dismissiveness did little to mitigate the risk that the harm would recur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Also of concern was the risk of the daughters causing harm to others. The CPS deposed unchallenged that the daughters had inflicted bruises on each other (and the son) during their physical altercations, even if there was limited evidence on the extent of those bruises. The younger daughter, in particular, had been reported by her school to display aggression towards her teachers and school counsellors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> And this aggression went unchecked by the mother, who encouraged her to bring a penknife to school when she reported to the mother that she had been bullied at school. Matters came to a head in December 2023 reported by the mother to the police for violence towards the mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The daughters were thus a danger not only to themselves but to others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For the son, the CPS deposed, and the mother did not substantially dispute, that he had scalded himself while at home following inadequate adult supervision. Troublingly, the daughters had also hurt themselves while attempting to cook at home without adult supervision. Even if the risks in respect of the son was less than those in respect of the daughters, the lack of adequate adult supervision of the son while in the care of the mother placed him in need of care and protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I thus found that the children were behaving in manners that were harmful to themselves and/or others. Given the limited insight of the mother into these concerns and the general neglect by her to address them, the children were in need of care and protection within s 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Emotional or psychological abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I agreed with the CPS that the younger daughter suffered or would likely suffer emotional harm because she had been emotionally or psychologically abused by the mother. The mother had repeatedly used degrading language on the younger daughter and had thrown handfuls of salt at the younger daughter while saying “go away demon” with the family helper sweeping up the salt thereafter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The mother denied that she had emotionally or psychologically abused the younger daughter on the ground that the CPS “does not and could never have any evidence for any of their statements”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The mother added, in respect of the incident involving the salt, that it was “not about throwing salt but salt cures”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Ultimately, these denials did little to controvert the claims for the CPS, which claims were well-founded in the evidence, that the younger daughter had been emotionally or psychologically abused by the mother, and that she had suffered emotional harm in the form of antisocial tendencies in consequence. The denials of the mother of the same revealed a lack of insight into the effects of her actions on the younger daughter that placed the younger daughter in need of care and protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Appropriate CPOs to be made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Having found that the children were in need of care and protection within s 5(1) of the CYPA, I moved to consider the appropriate CPOs to be made in respect of each child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The daughters faced grave risks. The elder daughter was at moral danger and was at risk of harming herself and/or others, even as she expressed a desire to return to the care of the mother. The younger daughter was likewise at moral danger and at risk of harming herself and/or others, had further been emotionally and psychologically abused, and resisted any attempt to return her to the care of the mother. Still, the wishes of a child on his or her care arrangements are not determinative, and the court will consider those views alongside the other evidence before it (see <em>WKM</em> at [62]–[64]) On the facts, the welfare and best interests of the daughters necessitated their committal to places of safety for a sustained period. This period would give the CPS time to put in place the interventions necessary to support the daughters and the mother while allied professionals worked with the mother towards her re-integration with the daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The CPS proposed that the elder daughter be placed at CSL and the younger daughter be placed at IPAC. The mother complained that the elder daughter had suffered insect bites and the younger daughter had developed dermatitis during their earlier placements. In response, the CPS confirmed that CSL and IPAC had been made aware of and had the capacity to manage these skin conditions. I thus placed the elder daughter at CSL and the younger daughter at IPAC for 12 months. I also directed that these placements were to be reviewed in 6 months so that appropriate order can be made were the circumstances to change.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The son faced milder risks that stemmed from his inadequate supervision by the mother. These risks did not necessitate his removal from the care of the mother. Nevertheless, having an AWO supervise his situation in the care of the mother would conduce to his welfare and best interests. I thus placed the son under the supervision of an AWO for 12 months, with a review in 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With a view to addressing any underlying mental health concerns that had contributed to the risks that the children faced, I directed the parents to work with the CPS and other professionals to ensure the safety and well-being of the children. I also directed them to undergo such assessments, treatments, counselling, and programmes as identified by the AWO to be in the welfare and best interests of the children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [13]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [22(b)(iii),</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC89</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC [19(a)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>2CPSAEIC at [12]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>3MAEIC16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [20(a)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>3CPSAEIC at RT-35</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>CFPS Report 14/3/24 at [14]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Social Report 23 October 2023 at [5.1]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>CFPS Report 14/3/24 at [8]–[9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>CFPS Report 14/3/24 at [11]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>3CPSAEIC at [11]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [23(c)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>3CPSAEIC at [8]–[11]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>1CPSAEIC at [23(a)(ii)]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>2MAEIC at p 6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>2MAEIC at p 9</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2546 of 2023 (Summons No 1346 of 2024)","title":"WYX v WYY","citation":"[2024] SGFC 45","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31691-SSP.xml","counsel":["Sabrina Wong Xue Yun (SC Wong Law Chambers) for the plaintiff","Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan (Murthy & Co) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYX v WYY</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYX <em>v</em> WYY </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31691-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 45</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I heard oral arguments on 24 June 2024. At that hearing, counsel for the Wife, Mr Thirumurthy, confirmed that his client was not seeking discovery in respect of all the items set out in the list annexed to SUM 1346. Instead, she was seeking discovery in respect of the following documents as had been set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 of her supporting affidavit for SUM 1346:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Passport details and copies of the Husband’s travel history to other countries for the years 2021, 2022 and up to November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Payslips for the years 2020, 2021, 2022 up to November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This was procedurally irregular. None of these documents which the Wife was seeking had been prayed for in SUM 1346. Mr Thirumurthy explained that there was no prejudice to the Husband because he had, in a letter dated 6 May 2024, informed the Husband’s lawyer, Ms Sabrina Wong (“Ms Wong”) that he would be pursuing discovery in respect of these two items. Although Ms Wong confirmed that she was aware of this request, she raised the objection that SUM 1346 was indeed procedurally irregular as the two items which the Wife sought had not been prayed for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that Ms Wong was prepared and able to deal with the Wife’s request, I proceeded to deal with the Wife’s request on the merits, notwithstanding this procedural irregularity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Insofar as discovery is concerned, Rule 63(4) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Discovery in respect of ancillary relief</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">63.—(1)    Subject to paragraphs (7) and (9) and rule 73, the Court may, at any time, on the application of any party to an action or matter (called in this rule the applicant), make an order requiring any other party (called in this rule the respondent) to make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application, or any class of documents so specified or described —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power;

<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a>; <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a>. These principles are not in dispute in the present case. Parties, however, dispute that I should order discovery in respect of the two categories of documents which the Wife has sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In relation to the travel documents (above at [1(a)]), Mr Thirumurthy explained that these issues were directly relevant to the issue of child maintenance. This was because the Husband had, apparently, only offered to pay $400 per month in child maintenance. Mr Thirumurthy explained that if the Husband could travel, he could well afford to pay a higher amount of maintenance for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In response, Ms Wong argued that the travel documents were irrelevant to the issue of child maintenance. She argued that, as a matter of law, the quantum of child maintenance was to be determined by what the needs of the child were. The frequency of the Husband’s travels should have no bearing on the quantum of maintenance for the child. In any event, this was, according to Ms Wong, a fishing expedition because the Wife had only asked for the travel documents at the first round of voluntary disclosures and not the second.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While Ms Wong is right in that child maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, the quantum of child maintenance is something to be assessed having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case. Parties are expected to show how their projected expenditure for the child’s expenses is reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances including the child’s standard of living <b>and the parents’ financial means and resources</b>: <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) at [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       That being said, I did not see how the records of the Husband’s travels were relevant to showing his financial means and resources. At best, these records would show the number of countries which the Husband had been to, and the duration of each trip. It would not show how much the Husband had actually spent on each trip. For instance, as I pointed out to Mr Thirumurthy during the hearing, the travel records would not show whether the Husband had flown in first class, or by budget airline.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In any event, it appeared to me that the Wife may have had <em>other</em> reasons for seeking disclosure of the Husband’s travel documents. In her counterclaim re-dated 19 October 2023, she had, at para 2(j), said that the Husband would disappear from the matrimonial home on Sundays and Public Holidays. She had eventually discovered that on these occasions, the Husband had travelled to Malaysia and other countries on his own. The Wife suspected that the Husband had “sexual associations” with females whenever he went on these trips, although the Husband had, when confronted, denied it. The Wife’s request for the Husband’s travel documents, when read in light of what she had set out in her counterclaim, suggests that she may well have had a collateral purpose, which were unrelated to the hearing of the ancillary matters, for seeking those documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Therefore, for the reasons which I have set out above, I disallow the Wife’s request as set out above at [1(a)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s request for the Husband’s payslips (above at [1(b)]). Again, as Mr Thirumurthy had explained, the Wife wanted the payslips to show that the Husband was actually able to afford more in terms of child maintenance. As the Wife had set out at paragraph 8 of her affidavit in support, she wanted the payslips to show that the Husband was being reimbursed for internet and telephone bills. These payslips were also, as Mr Thirumurthy had explained, relevant to showing the Husband’s income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In response, Ms Wong once again argued that the Wife was on a fishing expedition. The Husband’s IRAS statements had already been disclosed. The Wife was thus well aware of the Husband’s salary. Even if the payslips were required to show the amount of reimbursements, the extent of disclosure sought had to be circumscribed by the amount in dispute. Disclosure of the payslips should therefore not be ordered given that the reimbursements came in at about $230 each month. Ms Wong had also pointed out that the Wife had not asked for the Husband’s payslips in her voluntary request for disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the arguments, I disallow the Wife’s request for the Husband’s payslips. Rule 63(4) and 63(7) make it clear that before a summons for discovery can be taken out, the documents which are sought must first be asked for during the voluntary disclosure process. In the present case, it is clear that the Wife had not asked for the Husband’s payslips in both her first,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and second requests for discovery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was therefore not open to her to now seek discovery in respect of those documents in SUM 1346.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In any event, the payslips were, in my judgment, not necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters. For one, the Husband had already disclosed his income tax statements. Those statements would clearly allow his income and means to be assessed. Insofar as the Wife had claimed that she wanted the payslips to show that the Husband could clearly pay more as a matter of child maintenance, our jurisprudence makes it clear that parties should, in seeking to quantify what are a child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an “overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure”: <em>WBU</em> at [10]. It was therefore not necessary for the Wife to have the Husband’s payslips in order to propose a suitable figure in respect of the quantum of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 1346 is therefore dismissed. Parties are to file their written submissions on costs by 12 July 2024, limited to a maximum of 3 pages each. The time limited for filing an appeal shall only begin to run once I have issued my decision on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Wong and Mr Thirumurthy for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1346 dated 13 May 2024 at p 23 – 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 1346 dated 13 May 2024 at p 149.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)","title":"WYA v WYB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 43","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31690-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff","Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-07-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYA v WYB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYA <em>v</em> WYB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31690-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 43</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 July 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff; Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYA — WYB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 July 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on costs in respect of SUM 1063, which was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories. My written grounds in respect of the Wife’s application can be found in <em>WYA v WYB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31611-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 37</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that because she had substantially succeeded in her application, the Husband should have to pay her costs fixed at $3500 (including disbursements of $570).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband, on the other hand, argued that there should be no order as to costs. Two reasons are given. First, that both parties were equally successful in SUM 1063.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Second, that such an order is necessary to minimise “the acrimony and discontent” between the parties. In this vein, counsel for the Husband asserts that there is a significant degree of acrimony between the parties, and that parties have a strained relationship.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> There has, however, been no reference to specific examples of such acrimonious behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The principles relating to costs are well-established and not disputed in the present case. The starting point is that costs shall follow the event, though the court can depart from this, taking into account factors such as the conduct of parties: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> citing Rule 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I order that costs be fixed at $1350 (all-in). I consider this to be an appropriate sum taking into account the complexity of this application, that it was heard in a half-day slot, as well as the fact that the Wife had only partly, and not substantially, succeeded in her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As a final point, I add that I could not agree with the argument made by counsel for the Husband, that there should be no order as to costs because there was a significant degree of acrimony between the parties who both had a strained relationship. This appeared to be a mere assertion. Counsel had not referred to any specific instances which evidenced such a significant degree of acrimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having perused the various affidavits and pleadings, I was hard pressed to find instances of such conduct. In this vein, I add that it would be useful for counsel to, if they are taking the position that no order to costs should be made to avoid aggravating relations between the parties, to point to specific instances demonstrating the bad blood between the parties. This could include, amongst other things, applications for personal protection orders, or communications between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I conclude with one final observation. I do not think that the proposition of law laid down in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>, can or should be used as a pretext to avoid having pay costs to the other party who has succeeded in their application. In other words, I did not think it is open to a party to simply assert, without more, that relations were acrimonious and so there should be no order as to costs. While one may expect a certain degree of acrimony in divorce proceedings given that it represents the end of a life once shared in love and joy, not every party to a divorce will react badly. Some may find, within themselves, an inner strength to move on. Others may also be able to see past their hurt, and even remain on talking terms with their former spouse. On the other end of the spectrum, however, are those who find themselves unable to let go of past hurts. It is in such situations, where it is clear to the court that there is indeed acrimony between the parties, that it might be appropriate to make no order as to costs. Such matters are, however, an assessment the court must make in the exercise of its discretion as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions on Costs at paras 3 and 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at para 8.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2024-06-21","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1970 of 2022 (Summons No 2855 of 2023)","title":"WYM v WYN","citation":"[2024] SGFC 42","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31667-SSP.xml","counsel":["Annette Kong, Deborah Ng, Tan Jin Song (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","the defendant absent and unrepresented"],"timestamp":"2024-06-27T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYM v WYN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYM <em>v</em> WYN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31667-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 42</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1970 of 2022 (Summons No 2855 of 2023)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">21 June 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Annette Kong, Deborah Ng, Tan Jin Song (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; the defendant absent and unrepresented </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYM — WYN </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">21 June 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment Reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision in respect of costs for SUM 2855 of 2023 (“SUM 2855”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Divorce proceedings had commenced on 10 May 2022. Interim judgment had been granted on 22 June 2022. A consent order was entered into on 4 November 2022: FC/ORC 5271/2022 (“ORC 5271”). That order provided that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff the sum of $80,000 over the next 24 months, in installments of $3,333 per month, with the final installment of $3341. Each payment was to be made on or before the 30<sup>th</sup> day of each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Defendant was late in making payment for the 7<sup>th</sup> instalment. Thereafter, he made no further payments. This meant that he was in breach of ORC 5271.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 14 September 2023, the Plaintiff commenced examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) proceedings in SUM 2855. There were multiple delays in the hearing of SUM 2855.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       When SUM 2855 finally came up before me on the 27<sup>th</sup> of May 2024, counsel for the Plaintiff, sought leave to withdraw SUM 2855 in light of the Defendant’s bankruptcy proceedings. I granted leave to withdraw. Counsel for the Plaintiff asked for costs to be fixed at $1500 (all-in), to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Given that the Defendant did not show up for that hearing, I directed counsel for the Plaintiff to put in written submissions on costs by 3 June 2024. I also directed that a copy of these submissions be served on the Defendant, who had until 17 June 2024 to file a response. These instructions were conveyed, via Registrar’s Notice, to both parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel filed their written submissions, as directed, on 3 June 2024. As of 20 June 2024, the Defendant had yet to file his submission on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Plaintiff’s Submission on Costs </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Counsel for the Plaintiff cites, in support of their argument that the Plaintiff is entitled to costs, Rule 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Special matters to be taken into account in exercising discretion</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">854.  The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs must, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    any payment of money into Court and the amount of such payment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the conduct of all the parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in particular, the extent to which the parties have followed any relevant pre-action protocol or practice directions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In particular, counsel for the Plaintiff highlights that it is the Defendant’s conduct in this case that warrants a costs order in the Plaintiff’s favour. In support of their point, they cite the learned authors of <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at [854.01] and [854.02]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[854.01] … costs are not ordered in matrimonial cases unless there is a need to regulate the litigation process, discourage misconduct, or incentivise sensible behaviour…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[854.02] Although the parties’ conduct is only one of several factors which the court may take into account, it has been opined that, in certain cases, this factor may take centre stage (citing <em>See Khng Thian Huat v Riduan bin Yusof</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) in respect of Rules of the Supreme Court O 59 r 5)…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Insofar as the Defendant’s conduct is concerned, counsel for the Plaintiff highlights that the Defendant was absent at four hearings held on 29 January 2024, 15 April 2024, 29 April 2024 and 27 May 2024. Counsel argues that the Defendant was absent without good reason and that he was in breach of directions for him to serve his completed questionnaire<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> for the purposes of the examination of judgment debtor proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Because of the Defendant’s conduct, SUM 2855 was dragged out over a period of 8 months, and the Plaintiff had been forced to expend considerable costs to enforce the consent order for the outstanding installment payments.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This includes disbursements which added up to $144.50.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Finally, counsel for the Plaintiff argues that the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings do not fetter the Court’s discretion to make an award of costs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Where costs are concerned, Rule 852 of the FJR 2014 provides the starting point: costs shall follow the event. The court, however, can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case warrant it: Rule 852(2). It is also trite that costs are in the court’s discretion – Rule 854 sets out the factors that the court must consider in its exercise of discretion as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having considered the points made by counsel for the Plaintiff, as well as the Defendant’s conduct, and the disbursements incurred by the Plaintiff, I order that costs be fixed at $650 (all-in), to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Such an order is warranted for the following reasons. First, I note that the Defendant’s conduct and absence from proceedings had indeed resulted in delays. For instance, at the hearing on 29 January 2024, which the Defendant did not attend, counsel for the Plaintiff requested that the EJD proceedings be suspended so that instructions could be taken from their client as to whether committal proceedings should be pursued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It also appears that counsel for the Plaintiff had asked that EJD proceedings be suspended because the Defendant had also failed to fill in and serve the questionnaire despite repeated reminders. In that regard, much leeway had been afforded to the Defendant – he had originally been directed to file and serve the completed questionnaire by 27 December 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> However, at the hearing on 15 April 2024, which the Defendant did not attend, that questionnaire had yet to be completed and served. Counsel for the Plaintiff sought a 1-week extension of time for the Defendant to complete the questionnaire.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In considering the Defendant’s conduct, I also considered it relevant to account for any reasons which the Defendant may have had for his absence from these hearings. In this connection, I do not agree with the Plaintiff’s assertion that the Defendant’s actions were “intentional and contumelious”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In my judgment, it appears that the Defendant’s absence may be traced to the difficult circumstances which he finds himself in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I have arrived at this conclusion based on what the Defendant had said at the hearing held on 1 April 2024. He mentioned that he had taken a career break in February 2023 because of depression. He had managed to get a job at the end of last year, but still faced financial issues for which he sought help from Credit Counselling Singapore. He explained that he was unaware of the proceedings because he had a tough time, and did not open his letterbox for a good six months.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He also explained that he needed more time to answer the questionnaire because it had been quite taxing dealing with the pending bankruptcy proceedings against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     To the Defendant’s credit, he did appear to have, apart from his appearance at the hearing on 1 April 2024, made one other attempt to turn up for the proceedings. Although the Defendant was absent when I heard SUM 2855 on 27 May 2024, he had sent an email to the Family Court Registry a few hours after the hearing had concluded to ask when the hearing was about to start. It appears that he might have inadvertently overlooked the Registrar’s Notice that had been sent out informing him that the hearing had been refixed to an earlier slot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the above, I am prepared to take a charitable view of the Defendant’s conduct in that he had failed to turn up at the hearings because of his present circumstances, and not because he was deliberately attempting to frustrate the Plaintiff’s attempts to enforce ORC 5271.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     That being said, I cannot ignore the fact that the Defendant’s conduct had indeed caused delays insofar as the hearing of SUM 2855 was concerned, but also meant that the Plaintiff had to incur additional expense in considering alternative ways of enforcing ORC 5271.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, I add that the award of costs which I have ordered (above at [14]) in this case signals that in our family justice system which adopts therapeutic justice, parties are expected to participate in proceedings (see <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (“<em>VVB</em>”) at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14] where the court took the view that an award of costs signals that taking an adversarial stance in proceedings is unacceptable in a system that adopts therapeutic justice).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Therapeutic justice focusses on helping parties move on by focusing on resolving the problems at hand: <em>VVB</em> at [28]; <em>VDZ v VEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25178-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 858</a> at [75] – [79]. The corollary of this is that parties are expected to attend hearings where their attendance is expected – for example, in cases where they are self-represented. They are also expected to comply with all court directions and orders. They cannot bury their heads in the sand. Problems can hardly be solved if one party does not participate and is either continually absent from proceedings where their attendance is expected or refuses to comply with court directions.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/civil/respond-order-for-examination-judgment-debtor.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Minute Sheet dated 11 December 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Minute Sheet dated 15 April 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Minute Sheet dated 1 April 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs","Family Law – Costs – Whether Legal Aid obtained through fraud or misrepresentation"],"date":"2024-06-14","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4868 of 2022 (Summons No 1012 of 2024)","title":"WXG v WXH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 41","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31649-SSP.xml","counsel":["Tang King Kai (Tang & Partners) for the plaintiff","Ng Wen Wen (Grace Law LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-06-26T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WXG v WXH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WXG <em>v</em> WXH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4868 of 2022 (Summons No 1012 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">14 June 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Tang King Kai (Tang &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff; Ng Wen Wen (Grace Law LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WXG — WXH </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Whether Legal Aid obtained through fraud or misrepresentation</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">14 June 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on costs in respect of SUM 1012. My decision in respect of that summons, which was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories, can be found in <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband is the recipient of legal aid. His counsel, Mr Tang, has been appointed by the Legal Aid Bureau (“LAB”) to act for him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Where costs are concerned, there are two relevant provisions. The first is s 12(4)(<em>c</em>) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAA”). That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Endorsement and filing of Grant of Aid</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where any Grant of Aid is so filed, the aided person —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    is not, except where express provision is made in this Act, liable for costs to any other party in any proceedings to which the Grant of Aid relates; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The second relevant provision is s 14 of the LAA. It states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Court may order payment of costs by aided person in certain event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.—(1)    Where it appears to a court that any of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3) exists in relation to an aided person, the court may order the aided person to pay the costs of all or any of the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Director;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the solicitor who acted for the aided person;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In subsection (1), a reference to an “aided person” includes, in any case where the Grant of Aid has been cancelled before the making of the order, the person who immediately before the cancellation was the aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Grant of Aid issued to the aided person has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the aided person acted improperly in bringing or defending any legal proceedings, or in the conduct of those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where an order is made under subsection (1), the costs must be taxed as if the party ordered to pay costs were not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The costs so ordered to be paid must, unless otherwise directed by the order, include —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), were expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or were advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs of the Director or the solicitor who acted for the aided person ordered to be paid under subsection (1) include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5), then if any amount is recovered by the Director in respect of such costs, the same must be applied in the first instance in or towards the satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ Submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Counsel for the Wife, Ms Ng, argued in her written submissions that the Husband should, notwithstanding the fact that he was the recipient of legal aid, be ordered to pay costs of $3000. She argued that the Husband’s conduct warranted such a costs order being made. For one, the Wife had incurred significant costs as a result of various delays in proceedings being brought on by the Husband’s non-compliance and obstruction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Husband had, according to Ms Ng, delayed matters by claiming at various junctures, that he was seeking legal aid, or that he was looking for another lawyer, or that he wanted to settle the matter with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       A more serious allegation which the Wife levels at the Husband is that he had obtained legal aid through fraud or misrepresentation (s 14(3)(<em>a</em>) of the LAA). Ms Ng highlighted several pieces of evidence which pointed to this. The first was in relation to the arguments that had been advanced in the hearing of SUM 1012 before me. Ms Ng had, in that hearing, explained that discovery was necessary because there was a suspicion that the Husband had dissipated assets and closed his bank accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It was also highlighted that the Wife was surprised that the Husband had qualified for legal aid on 25 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The second reason Ms Ng advances as to why the Husband should be made to pay costs is that s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the LAA applied in the present case – in other words, the Husband had acted improperly in defending SUM 1012 or in his conduct of the proceedings. Ms Ng argues that the Husband’s failure to provide full and frank disclosure and withholding critical information constitutes improper conduct within the meaning of s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the LAA. Because of the Husband’s refusal to disclose documents that should have been disclosed in the voluntary disclosure process prior to the hearing of ancillary matters, that necessitated the Wife taking out SUM 1012.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Tang, on the other hand, argued that the Husband should not be ordered to pay costs as s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the LAA did not apply in the present case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> For one, merely defending the application could not possibly constitute improper conduct – it was well within the Husband’s rights to resist the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1012. In any case, what the Husband had wanted to do in SUM 1012 was to explain why he could not comply with the Wife’s specific requests for discovery and interrogatories. Mr Tang also emphasised that the Husband had not been dilatory in replying or disclosing the documents which he had in his possession. The Husband had, as early as 8 January 2023, voluntarily disclosed the existence and details of all his bank accounts and amounts standing in credit to the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Finally, it should also be noted that the Wife was not entirely successful in her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The statutory scheme as set out in the LAA makes it clear that costs shall not be ordered against a legally aided person, unless the exceptions set out in either s 14(3)(<em>a</em>) or s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the LAA were made out. The statutory scheme modifies the position as to costs that are set out in Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014: see <em>CSR v CSS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29457-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 5 SLR 675</a> at [34].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The question which I had to decide was whether these two exceptions were established in the present case such that the Husband should be ordered to pay the Wife costs of SUM 1012. The decision of the General Division of the High Court in <em>Anpex Pte Ltd v Cheng Yong Sun</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29042-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 294</a> (“<em>Anpex</em>”) provides a useful illustration as to when these exceptions are made out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In that case, the plaintiff had sought costs against the second defendant who was legally aided. The court ruled (<em>Anpex</em> at [4]) that the fact that the second defendant’s defence had failed was not, in of itself, evidence of misconduct. If this was the case, then every plaintiff who succeeds against a legally aided defendant would be entitled to costs. There had to be evidence that the defendant had conducted their defence in a way that a reasonable defendant would not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In addition, the court also considered (<em>Anpex</em> at [5] – [7]) whether the second defendant had obtained legal aid through fraud or misrepresentation. The court asked for evidence of how legal aid was applied and approved. An Assistant Director of Legal Aid from the LAB (the “Director”) gave evidence that when the second defendant applied for legal aid, she had met the criteria as her savings and non-CPF investments were below the threshold limit of $10,000 and that she did not own any other property besides her HDB flat. The Director also explained that a legal aid applicant’s wealth was determined at the point of application for legal aid and that there was no reason to suspect that the second defendant earned a salary above what was declared in her CPF statements. LAB also did not have any information that the second defendant was concealing assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Based on this, the court was satisfied that the second defendant was technically entitled to legal aid. There was therefore no basis to order that the second defendant pay costs to the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In the present case, I did not think it open to me to decide, at this stage, whether the Husband had indeed procured legal aid through fraud or misrepresentation. That would involve determining whether the Husband had indeed dissipated assets, and when he had done so. This is also the precise issue that has to be decided by the judge hearing the ancillary matters. In any event, determining whether legal aid had been procured through fraud or misrepresentation would also turn on what the Husband had told LAB, and why LAB had decided to grant legal aid (see <em>Anpex</em> at [5] – [6]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for the Wife’s argument, that s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the LAA applied because the Husband had, through his actions, caused substantial delays, there was insufficient material before me to decide whether the substantial delays were indeed because of the Husband’s actions. It appears that the delays arose from the fact that LAB had cancelled the provisional grant of aid on the 13<sup>th</sup> of October 2023 and subsequently reinstated the provisional grant of aid on the 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2023. There is, currently, nothing on the record that sheds light on LAB’s decision to rescind the grant of legal aid, before subsequently restoring it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In the circumstances, the costs of SUM 1012 shall be reserved to the judge hearing the ancillary matters: Rule 853(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014. LAB is to provide evidence of how legal aid was applied for and approved (see <em>Anpex</em> at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It remains for me to thank both Mr Tang and Ms Ng, once again, for their assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Grant of Aid dated 19 February 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions dated 12 June 2024 at [8].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions dated 12 June 2024 at [9].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions dated 12 June 2024 at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dated 3 June 2024 at [6].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dated 3 June 2024 at [5(ii)].</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Discovery","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories – Sufficiency of Answer"],"date":"2024-06-12","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1157 of 2022 (Summons No 913, 1122 and 1123 of 2024)","title":"WYI v WYJ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 39","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31642-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-06-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYI v WYJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYI <em>v</em> WYJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31642-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 39</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1157 of 2022 (Summons No 913, 1122 and 1123 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">12 June 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the Defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYI — WYJ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Sufficiency of Answer</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">12 June 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are the facts as I have found them in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). Parties were married on the 16<sup>th</sup> of April 2008 in India. They had one child. Both Husband and Wife are Singapore Permanent Residents. They bought a HDB flat. The details of how the marriage broke down are set out in some detail in the SOP. It is not necessary for me to narrate the details, save to say that the Husband filed for divorce on 21 March 2022. Interim judgment was obtained on 29 May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This set of proceedings follows the process of voluntary disclosure that takes place before the ancillary matters hearing. Both the Husband and Wife were dissatisfied with the information and documents that the other party had disclosed, and thus took out their respective applications for discovery and interrogatories. SUM 913 of 2024 (“SUM 913”) is the Husband’s request for discovery. SUM 1122 (“SUM 1122”) and 1123 of 2024 (“SUM 1123”) are the Wife’s applications for interrogatories and discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard all three applications on 30 May 2024. This is my decision in respect of SUM 913, SUM 1122 and SUM 1123.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Item 1 was a request for the Wife to provide her personal bank statements of all types (current/savings/joint accounts etc) either in Singapore or overseas for the past 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband, who was self-represented at the hearing, explained that these documents were indeed relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters. He also argued that the Wife should, at the very least, furnish an explanation if she was unable to produce the documents which he had asked for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, Mr Suppiah, pointed out that the Wife had given bank statements from her Singapore bank accounts for the past 6 months, and that there was no basis to ask for 3 years’ worth of statements. As for the statements from the Wife’s bank accounts in India, the Wife would produce those documents but she would require more time to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having considered the arguments, I order that the Wife is to disclose bank statements for all her bank accounts, both in Singapore and abroad, for the period January 2020 – December 2023. I note that relations between the parties had already begun to deteriorate as early as 2020. In that vein, it would be useful for the court, as well as the Husband, to have a clear picture of the Wife’s financial situation from the time the marriage broke down till after divorce proceedings had commenced: <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I turn now to Item 2. This was a request for the Wife to produce “business bank statements of all types (current/savings/joint accounts etc) either in Singapore or overseas” for the past 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband explained, during the hearing, that the documents he sought were in relation to two businesses. One was Company X. The Wife is a director and a majority shareholder of this company.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The other business was a partnership in India (“Partnership X”). It is also disclosed that the Wife is a partner of Partnership X.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Husband wants these documents because he suspects that the Wife has been hiding matrimonial assets in the business bank accounts of both Company X, Partnership X, and any other businesses that she may have.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In response, Mr Suppiah argued that in relation to Company X, the Wife had explained that she could not disclose the documents sought because the company constitution prohibited her from doing so. In any event, she has produced some financial statements of both Company X and Partnership X that were in her possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Insofar as the disclosure of company documents are concerned, the principles laid down in <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194) are relevant and bear reproducing in full here:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">20    More directly, a helpful summary of the relevant principles relating to discovery of documents belonging to a company of which the husband was a director and shareholder can be found in B v B at 193–194:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The documents of a company are in the legal possession of the company. If they are or have been in the actual physical possession of a director who is a party to litigation they must be disclosed by that director, if relevant to the litigation, even though he holds them as servant or agent of the company in his capacity as an officer of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    If the director who is a party to the litigation does not have physical possession of the documents, the question of fact of whether the documents are within the power of the director arises. “Power” in this context means “the enforceable right to inspect or obtain possession or control of the document” in the personal capacity of the director. This is in contradistinction to the right to inspect vested in a director in his capacity as a director. Without the consent of the company, the director has no right to inspect the documents. Much will depend on the share structure of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    If the company is the alter ego of such a director so that he has unfettered control of the company’s affairs, he must disclose and produce all relevant documents in the possession of the company. Where the company is not the alter ego of a director, the factors to be considered are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    the extent of the shareholding of the husband;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   whether it amounts to control of the company;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   whether the minority shareholders are adverse to him;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iv)   how the board of directors is constituted; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(v)    whether there is any objection by the board to disclosure of any of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    A very wide range of issues are relevant in proceedings relating to ancillary matters. The court has to assess what the husband is shown to have, but also what could reasonably be made available to him. In many cases, audited accounts of companies of which the husband is a shareholder will be sufficient, together with full disclosure of all the husband’s personal financial records. But there are cases when the court will go behind company accounts and order discovery of company books and documents. It is not usual, however, for the court to take this course unless there is evidence before it from accountants or other experts that the published accounts of the company cannot be relied upon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Where relevant documents in the possession of a company are disclosed by a director as being in his custody or power, the court has a discretion whether or not to order production of them. In exercising the discretion, the court will have regard to all the circumstances and balance the relevance and importance of the documents and the hardship likely to be caused to the wife by non-production against any prejudice to the husband and third parties likely to be caused by production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    It has not hitherto been the practice of the court to order production of company documents to which the board of directors objects on affidavit, provided that the court is satisfied that the objection is not contrived for the purpose of frustrating the powers of the court. The court will not in the exercise of its discretion order parties to do that which they have no power to do. The court will not order production unless it is satisfied that production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the issues between the parties or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Where the wife cannot obtain documents on discovery, she may be able to apply for leave to issue a subpoena against the secretary or other officers of the company to produce relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In other words, if the documents sought are in the Wife’s physical possession, she must disclose them. Alternatively, if those documents are not in her physical possession, but she can obtain them in her personal capacity, she too must disclose them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the present case, there was nothing before me to suggest that the Wife indeed had these bank statements in her physical possession, or that she could obtain them in her personal capacity. Insofar as the shareholding structure of the company was concerned, all that was disclosed before me is that the Wife is a majority shareholder with 72001 shares, whilst the other shareholder of Company X holds the remaining 48000 shares. This alone, without more, is insufficient for me to conclude that the bank statements were indeed within the Wife’s power to obtain. I would also note, for completeness, that there was nothing placed before me to demonstrate that the Wife had complete or substantial control over the affairs of Company X such that it was her alter ego.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the documents sought in respect of Partnership X, I did not think that it was open to me to order the disclosure of its bank accounts. For one, it is uncertain as to whether the other disclosed partner to Partnership X also has, pursuant to the laws of India where the partnership is based, a joint interest in the bank accounts that are sought. As I had noted on a previous occasion, the scope of disclosure in relation to partnership documents appears to be based on the <em>type</em> of document in question – for example, partnership books would generally not be disclosed because the Partnership Act 1980 makes it clear that every other partner to the partnership shall have access to inspect and copy the books: <em>WWU v WWV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31491-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 26</a> at [11] – [15].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In any event, even if I <em>could</em> order disclosure of these documents sought, I did not think that I <em>should</em> order disclosure. I do not think that these documents are necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters – insofar as the Husband suspects the Wife of hiding matrimonial assets in the accounts of Company X and Partnership X, there are other ways by which this may be established. For example, transfers of large amounts of cash from one’s personal accounts or from the parties’ joint accounts may suggest that assets are indeed being dissipated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore disallow the request in respect of Item 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I come now to Item 3. This was a request for the Wife’s past 3 years of IRAS Notice of Assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband argued that these documents were needed to give him a holistic view of the Wife’s income. He pointed out that she had not disclosed these documents, and that if the Wife could ask him for his IRAS Notice of Assessment, he too could seek the same from the Wife. He further argues that if the Wife claims that she cannot obtain the statements from IRAS, she is to provide proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I will allow the request in respect of Item 3. There can be no quarrel that the IRAS Notice of Assessment will indeed be relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It will allow the Husband to gauge the Wife’s means and would also be relevant for the issue of maintenance. I must also add that insofar as the Husband had argued that he is entitled to ask for these documents because the Wife had asked him for the same, parties are not to engage in tit-for-tat: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> at [47]. Such an argument has no basis in law and only serves to distract parties from the core issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn now to the last request: Item 4. This was a request for the Wife to disclose documents relating to any properties that she owns. The Husband explained that he was asking for these documents because the Wife was, according to him, hiding properties in India. He says that ascertaining which properties the Wife has in India is relevant not only to the division of matrimonial assets, but also maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will allow the request in respect of Item 4. I am satisfied that these documents are relevant and necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters, specifically, the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Interrogatories should only be ordered if they are relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters or for saving costs: <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>; see also Rule 69(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Rule 69(5) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 sets out a basis on which the court can grant an order for interrogatories. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The applicant may apply to the Court for an order for the relevant interrogatories to be answered if —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    no response is received from the respondent within the period specified in paragraph (3); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    the respondent has stated in writing, pursuant to paragraph (3), that he is not willing or not able to answer any or all of the interrogatories served.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Apart from Rule 69(5), Rule 69(9) and (10) are also relevant. They state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(9)    In deciding whether to grant an application for interrogatories, the Court must take into account any offer made by the respondent to give particulars, make admissions or produce documents relating to any matter in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(10)  Where the Court has ordered interrogatories to be answered, they must be answered by affidavit to be filed within such period as the Court directs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Collectively, these provisions deal with a situation where the spouse refuses to, or states that they are unwilling or unable to answer any of the interrogatories. If the interrogatory has been answered, but the answer is insufficient, Rule 70(2) – (3) allows the court to order further answers to be given. Those provisions state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Objections and insufficient answers to interrogatories</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Where any person on whom interrogatories have been served, or who has been ordered to answer interrogatories, under rule 69 answers any of them insufficiently, <b>the Court may make an order requiring him to make a further answer, either by affidavit or on oral examination as the Court may direct.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Where any person gives insufficient answers to interrogatories which have been served on him or ordered under rule 69, the party administering the interrogatories may ask for further and better particulars of the answers given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Therefore, in a situation where an answer has been provided to an interrogatory, I must look at the sufficiency of the answer in assessing whether interrogatories should be ordered. The truth of the answer does not concern me – any quarrel as to the truth of the answers given by the Husband must be taken up at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     During the course of the hearing, Mr Suppiah raised one point: that the Husband’s answers to the interrogatories as set out in his Notice in Response to the Wife’s Request for Interrogatories (“NIR”) needed to be properly documented and formalised by being set out in an affidavit. Mr Suppiah noted that the Husband was self-represented, but given the fact that the Husband had said many things which were not on record, he wanted the Husband’s answers to all the interrogatories which had been posed to be formally recorded down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     During the hearing, however, the Husband had referred to his answers as set out in his NIR. His argument was that none of the interrogatories posed to him should be ordered because he had already answered them in his NIR and that his answers were sufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For good order, I will order that the Husband also exhibit, in his compliance affidavit, a copy of the NIR. In any event, I shall, in dealing with the Wife’s request for interrogatories, take into account the Husband’s responses in his NIR given the Husband’s arguments that he had already provided sufficient responses in his NIR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I turn now to deal with the Wife’s requests. I will first deal with Items 1 and 2 together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Item 1 required the Husband to state whether he had quit his employment with his former company, AC, or whether he had been retrenched. Item 2 asked the Husband to state, since the day he became unemployed, the measures he had taken to regain employment. Mr Suppiah explained that these interrogatories were relevant and necessary to determining whether the Husband was trying to escape his obligation to paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     This was the Husband’s response to Item 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Already stated in the Plaintiff’s affidavit, employment contract terminated in 4 months and its within 6 months per agreement prior to company’s confirmation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As for Item 2, this was his response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Keep applying for similar and relevant job openings via various job portals in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Neither answer was, in my judgment, sufficient. In assessing the sufficiency of an answer to an interrogatory, one must consider the interrogatory that had been posed: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [29] – [30]. In addition, a general denial is not a sufficient answer to a specific averment: <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a> at [10] citing <em>Earp v Lloyd</em> [1858] 70 ER 24.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband did not, in his answer to Item 1, make clear whether he had been retrenched, or whether he had quit his job with AC. As for his answer to Item 2, he says he kept applying for similar and relevant job openings, but does not provide details as to this. If he had indeed applied for similar and relevant job openings, there was no reason why he could not provide, at the very least, some details of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I will therefore allow the request in respect of Items 1 and 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I turn now to Items 5, 6 and 7. These items were basically a request for the Husband to state whether he had, apart from his business, [P], any other sources of income in either India or Singapore. If so, he was to state the date on which he began to receive additional income, the source of income, the frequency at which he received such income, the amount of such income and the financial institution into which such income had been deposited into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Mr Suppiah argued that these interrogatories were relevant to the division of matrimonial assets, and also for any adverse inferences to be drawn in necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband’s responses to Items 5, 6 and 7 were: “No”, “No”, and “NA”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This is not a sufficient answer. As I had noted above (at [34]), a general denial is not a sufficient answer to a specific averment. In the present case, the Wife had, in her affidavit filed in support of SUM 1122 and 1123, stated that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…[T]he Plaintiff has multiple banking accounts in India, ancestry lands and properties that he has inherited or purchased and also has a business by the name of “Meyyappa Jewellers” in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Given this, and notwithstanding the fact that the interrogatories in Items 5 and 6 were crafted to elicit either a “yes” or “no” response, I am not satisfied that the Husband’s response is sufficient. What I have said, however, should not, in any way, be construed as casting doubt on the <em>truth</em> of the Husband’s answers. Given what the Wife had said in her affidavit, the Husband’s responses to the interrogatories posed must go further than a bare denial. Item 7 only required an answer if the answer to either Items 5 or 6 was a “yes”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I will therefore allow the request in Items 5, 6, and 7. I also order that the Husband provide an explanation as to whether he is involved with the business by the name of “MJ” in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I turn now to Items 9 and 10. This was the interrogatory posed in Item 9:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Apart from the bank account mentioned at paragraph 12 of the Plaintiff’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit, did the Defendant at any time maintain any account or investment in any type of financial institution in Singapore or overseas in his sole name or in joint names with others, or in the name of another, including current accounts, savings accounts, fixed deposit accounts, certificates of deposit accounts, off-shore accounts foreign currency or money market accounts, [g]old, silver or other precious metals trading accounts, investments accounts or other financial accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     If Item 9 was answered in the positive, Item 10 required the Husband to provide details which included, amongst other things, the type of accounts or investments as well as the name and address of the bank or financial institutions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband had answered “no” in relation to Item 9. As I have mentioned, above (at [40]), given the Wife’s averment in her affidavit that he has additional bank accounts, I do not think that the Husband’s answer, which takes the form of a bare denial, is sufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I will therefore allow the request in Item 9 and 10.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I turn now to deal with Items 11 and 12. The Husband was queried on whether he had transferred assets which were owned by him. Item 12 required the Husband to, if his answer to Item 11 was a “yes”, to provide the relevant details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband had, once again, answered “no” to Item 11. Again, as I had mentioned above (at [40]), this general denial is not a sufficient answer given what the Wife had stated in her affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Items 11 and 12 are allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Finally, I come to Items 13 and 14. Item 13 required the Husband to declare whether he owned any properties in India. Item 14 required the Husband, if he had answered Item 13 in the positive, to provide the relevant details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Again, because the Wife had stated in her affidavit that the Husband had multiple properties as well as ancestral lands in India, I am not satisfied that the Husband’s answers, which take the form of the barest of denials, are sufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will therefore allow the request in respect of Items 13 and 14.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     To round off, I note that there was also a corresponding request set out in Items 28 – 32 of the Wife’s application for discovery for the Husband to provide documents along with his responses to the interrogatories posed. In brief, the Wife wanted the Husband to disclose documents such as the letter of termination or resignation, as well as documents relating to any properties which the Husband may own in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I allow the corresponding requests for documents as is set out in Items 28 – 32. I am satisfied that these documents are indeed relevant and necessary to the determination of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I note, at the outset, that Mr Suppiah stated his difficulty determining the Husband’s position in relation to the Wife’s application for discovery – specifically, it was difficult to pinpoint exactly which categories of documents the Husband was willing to disclose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given this, I directed Mr Suppiah to proceed with all the items in the Wife’s request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I begin with Items 1 – 3. These were basically requests for documentary evidence to support the Husband’s assertion that he had taken out certain loans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Mr Suppiah argued that these documents were relevant to the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets as well as ascertaining the Husband’s means. He explained that the Wife was left in the dark as to what had been done about the money, and that her position was that the Husband was exaggerating the extent of his financial hardship. These documents were also relevant in allowing the Wife to argue that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for failing to disclose his assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In response, the Husband argued that he had already disclosed the document in respect of Item 1. As for Items 2 and 3, he did not have documents to produce because those were informal loans he had taken out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I disallow the request in respect of Items 1, 2 and 3. These documents, in my judgment, were not necessary for the disposal of the ancillary hearing matters. While they might have been relevant for determining the Husband’s means, there were other methods by which that might be ascertained – for example, by combing through the comings and goings of the Husband’s bank account statements. In any event, the onus lay on the Husband, having stated in his AOM, that he had taken out these loans, to provide proof of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn next to Items 5, 6, and 7. Item 5 was a request for bank statements, and Item 7 was a request for the IRAS Notice of assessment. Item 6 was a request for the valuation report of [P]. This is the business which the Husband runs as a sole-proprietor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Mr Suppiah explained that the request in respect of Items 5 and 7 were for documents for any company in which the Husband has an interest, be it as a director, shareholder or in some other capacity. He explained that the request was framed broadly because, apart from [P], there was no other available information as to whether the Husband had any interest or connections to any other companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I disallow the request in relation to Items 5 and 7. Where company documents are sought, one inquiry which must be considered is whether the documents sought are either in the Husband’s physical possession, or whether he has the power to obtain them: <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194. In determining whether the company documents are indeed within the Husband’s power to obtain, it may be relevant to look at, amongst other things, the shareholding structure of the company. Given the principles of law relating to the disclosure of company documents in the matrimonial context that had been laid down in <em>ACW</em>, it therefore follows that the request for discovery of company documents must be framed with some degree of specificity. At the very least, the request must state the name of the company and there must be some <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought are either within that spouse’s physical possession, or within their power to obtain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In any event, I have allowed the Wife’s request for interrogatories which required the Husband to disclose his interest in any other businesses (above at [42]). I have also allowed the corresponding request for discovery in that the Husband is to provide documents to support his answers to the interrogatories posed (above at [54]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As for Item 6, I disallow the request – again, there was no <em>prima facie</em> evidence that such a report existed. That said, I accept that the earnings from this business are relevant to the assessment of the Husband’s means. I therefore order the Husband to produce the business books of [P].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Item 8 was a request for the valuation report of the Husband’s car. Mr Suppiah argued that this was relevant to the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets as well as ascertaining the Husband’s means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In response, the Husband argued that there was no point in producing a valuation report because the car was reaching the end of its Certificate of Entitlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I disallow the request. While the Husband had provided an estimate as to the value of the car, there was nothing to suggest that he had done so on the basis of a valuation report. There must at least be some <em>prima facie</em> evidence that such a valuation report existed before an order for discovery may be made: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64] citing <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Item 11 was a request for the Husband’s CPF account balance statement. Mr Suppiah argued that it was relevant towards assessing the Husband’s means and the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I accept Mr Suppiah’s argument and allow the request in Item 11. I am satisfied that the CPF account balance statement is indeed relevant and necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters. I note that the Husband has disclosed a CPF statement showing the amount of monies withdrawn for housing, as well as his CPF statements for May to November 2023 in his Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”). However, he has not produced the statement showing his CPF account balance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I turn now to Items 13, 14, 15, and 16. These were basically requests for the Husband to provide documentary evidence in support of his alleged monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I disallow the request in relation to these items. As I pointed out to Mr Suppiah in the course of the hearing, this was something for the Husband to prove – in other words, he bore the onus of providing the necessary documents in support of his assertion as to his monthly expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Item 19 was a request that the Husband provide documentary evidence to show that he was indeed giving $400 each month to his sister as financial support. Mr Suppiah argued that these documents were relevant to determining the Husband’s means and earning capacity, as well as the issue of maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     In response, the Husband said that this document was not necessary to the disposal of ancillary matters. He claimed that he was supporting his sister, who was his only sibling, financially as she had lost her husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     I disallow the request in respect of Item 19. If the Husband asserts that he is giving $400 every month to his sister, then the onus is on him to establish that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I come now to Items 20 – 27. These items were, again, all requests for the Husband to provide documentary proof of his expenses. Mr Suppiah argued that these documents were relevant to the Husband’s means as well as the division of assets. He also pointed out that while the Husband had asserted that he had incurred these expenses, he did not provide any documentary proof of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I disallow the request in relation to Items 20 – 27. I note that the Husband has asserted, in his AOM, that he has spent certain sums, for example, paying for family trips. However, it does not appear that the Husband has provided any documents to back up his assertions. There may be an argument that can be made, but that is best ventilated at the hearing of the ancillary matter itself. The discovery process is not an avenue to challenge assertions made by the other side by demanding that they provide documents of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I therefore order the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>SUM 913</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_78-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_78-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Item 1 of the Husband’s affidavit filed in support of SUM 913 for the period January 2020 – December 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_78-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Items 3, and 4 of the Husband’s affidavit filed in support of SUM 913,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_78-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power.

I had earlier issued my written grounds in respect of both summons: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> (“<em>WXE</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SUM 1317 was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband submits that for SUM 1317, the Wife should bear costs, fixed at $2027.20 (all-in). They justify this on the basis that their client, the Husband, has substantially succeeded in SUM 1317. Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, argued that the Husband failed in most of the items that were proceeded on, and should therefore only be entitled to nominal costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As for SUM 959, that was the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Counsel for the Wife argues that for SUM 959 the Husband should bear costs in respect of SUM 959 as she had succeeded in most of her requests. Counsel for the Husband took the opposing view and argued that no order as to costs should be made in respect of SUM 959. That is because the Wife did not succeed in SUM 959 in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition, counsel for the Husband also submitted, citing the case of <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<em>JBB</em>”), that if I did not award costs for SUM 1317, then similarly, no order as to costs should be made for SUM 959 in order to avoid increasing hostility between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Insofar as the principles governing costs are concerned, they can be found in Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. In essence, if the court does award costs, the starting point is that costs shall follow the event. The court can, however, depart from this starting point, taking into account factors such as the conduct of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       One reason for departing from this starting point, and ordering that each party is to bear their own costs, or making no order as to costs, is to “minimise acrimony and discontent between parties” (see also <em>VJL v VGM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24701-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 59</a> at [135]; <em>TIJ v TIK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18469-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 147</a> at [23]). That was the point which had been made in <em>JBB</em>. There is much sense to taking such an approach. From a practical perspective, an order to pay costs may well create the potential for further discontent between parties. For instance, one party may well be tempted to, in an attempt to spite the other party, refuse to pay costs. This would spawn further applications to enforce the costs order (see <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26685-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 107</a> at [134] – [135]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It bears noting that what had been said in <em>JBB</em> is not a hard and fast rule – it does not mean that parties should always have to bear their own costs in matrimonial proceedings (see <em>WQR v WQS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30388-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 41</a> at [88]). Ultimately, costs are in the court’s discretion, and in certain cases, for example, where a party has acted unreasonably in the proceedings, that party may very well be ordered to bear the other party’s costs: see <em>UHG v UHH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21040-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 116</a> at [63] – [68]; <em>UTN v UTO and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23424-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 18</a> at [107]; <em>TNX v TNY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18869-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 50</a> at [51] – [60]. This may also be the case where a party has taken an adversarial stance in proceedings – an award of costs would reflect that doing so is simply unacceptable in our family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26]; <em>WLR and another v WLT and another and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 20</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, it was clear to me, from the conduct of the parties, that there was a great deal of acrimony and bitterness between them. I give two examples that point me to this conclusion. First, as I had noted in my judgment (<em>WXE</em> at [47]), parties appeared to have been engaging in tit-for-tat because at least one of the requests for discovery appeared to have been motivated by the fact that the other party had also asked that the same documents be disclosed. Second, the language used in some of the affidavits was also telling as to the strained relations between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There shall therefore be no order as to costs for SUM 959 and SUM 1317.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2024-05-21","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4479 of 2022 (Summons No 959 and 1317 of 2024)","title":"WXE v WXF","citation":"[2024] SGFC 29","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31617-SSP.xml","counsel":["Audrey Liaw Shu Juan, Joseph Tan Liqi, Jerome-Jon Tan Renyi, Yee May Kuen Peggy Sarah (PY Legal LLC) for the plaintiff","Robert Leslie Gregory (L G Robert) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-06-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WXE v WXF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WXE <em>v</em> WXF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4479 of 2022 (Summons No 959 and 1317 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">21 May 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Audrey Liaw Shu Juan, Joseph Tan Liqi, Jerome-Jon Tan Renyi, Yee May Kuen Peggy Sarah (PY Legal LLC) for the plaintiff; Robert Leslie Gregory (L G Robert) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WXE — WXF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">21 May 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The origins of Boxing Day are shrouded in the mists of time, but for many across the world, this season is a time of joy, love, and merriment. Parties had one more reason than most to celebrate. They were married on that very day in 1992.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband is an American expatriate, and the Wife, a Singaporean. About a year into the marriage, parties relocated to the United States. The Wife returned to Singapore on two occasions to give birth to the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> After spending little more than a decade abroad, parties relocated back to Singapore on account of the Wife, who wished to be closer with her family and friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is apparent from the parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Means and Assets (“AOMs”) that the Husband primarily bore the responsibility of being the breadwinner. The nature of his work meant that he travelled frequently to far-flung destinations across the globe. The Wife, on the other hand, was primarily responsible for holding the fort on the home front. She looked after the two children and took care of household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       However, not all was well insofar as the relationship between the Husband and the Wife was concerned. The Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) provides scant details as to why their relationship broke down, although clues may be found in the various affidavits filed by both parties. In any event, what is material is that the Husband filed for divorce on 27 September 2022, and interim judgment was granted on 14 March 2023. Mediation was conducted in an attempt to settle the outstanding ancillary matters. It failed. Parties thus embarked on the road to an ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There were two summons before me. SUM 1317 of 2024 (“SUM 1317”) is the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. SUM 959 is the Wife’s application for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I heard oral arguments on 15 May 2024. This is my decision in respect of SUM 1317 and SUM 959.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery and Interrogatories (SUM 1317) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Liaw, stated in her oral submissions that the Husband would only be proceeding with his application for discovery in respect of two categories of documents. The first was monthly statements for bank accounts (Item 5 of Annex A to SUM 1317). The second was credit card statements (Items 6 – 10 of Annex A to SUM 1317). Ms Liaw also confirmed that the Husband was no longer pursuing his request for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The documents sought in Item 5 were statements of the joint bank account that the Wife had with the son. Its existence had come to light when the Husband’s lawyers reviewed the parties’ joint bank account statement. Disclosure of this document was, as Ms Liaw put it, relevant and necessary to show whether monies from the parties’ joint bank account had been diverted and put into that account. Ms Liaw also made the point that the Wife cannot escape from her obligation to disclose the bank statements by giving the excuse that the account had been closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In response, counsel for the Wife, Mr Robert, argued that the Husband’s request in respect of Item 5 was a mere fishing expedition. The joint account the Wife had with the son had been closed, and in any case, the Wife had already explained the reason for the transfers between the parties’ joint account and the joint account with her son. It was, therefore, unnecessary to disclose the bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In response to this, Ms Liaw clarified that the Husband’s interest in these documents went beyond the few transactions that had been made from the parties’ joint bank account. The Husband needed these statements to confirm that the Wife had not been dissipating or hiding assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I will allow the Husband’s request. The documents sought were indeed relevant and necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters (see <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [13]). Any dubious transfers that involved large sums of cash would clearly show up on the account statements. It also does not suffice to say that disclosure should not be ordered because the account has been closed. If the Wife is unable to produce the statements, then she must explain why she is unable to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn next to the Husband’s request for credit card statements (Items 6 – 10 of Annex A to SUM 1317). His request was, once again, motivated by the suspicion that the Wife had dissipated matrimonial assets. Ms Liaw pointed out that there were, what appeared to be red flags in the sums that, according to the Wife in her response to the Husband’s request for interrogatories, had been applied towards credit card charges. For example, the Wife’s bank statement for her personal account with OCBC disclosed various deposits of $2,000 to $3,000. The Wife explained that she would first pay for the credit card charges using her OCBC personal account, and then reimburse the money by transferring the same sum from their joint account with DBS.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Mr Robert argued that the Husband’s request for these documents should be denied because the Husband, as the main card holder, should be able to obtain the statements that he sought. In any case, the Wife, being a supplementary card holder, could not obtain the statements sought because the Husband had cancelled the supplementary card that was in her name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I disallow the Husband’s request. He wanted the credit card statements to test the veracity of the Wife’s responses to his request for interrogatories. It appeared to me that the Husband was attempting to undertake a detailed forensic accounting approach in order to account for every cent that the Wife claimed had been spent on credit card bills. While it is indeed possible to undertake such an exercise, doing so would require an enormous amount of effort, incur a great deal of costs, and run the risk of reopening old wounds that could have the effect of obfuscating the actual issues in dispute (see the observations of the court in <em>TIG v TIH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18530-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 1218</a> at [28]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In this vein, while the documents were perhaps relevant towards showing whether the Wife had indeed been dissipating matrimonial assets – it did not mean that these documents were necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters or for saving costs: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [24] citing Rule 73 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”). If the Wife had indeed dissipated assets, there were other ways by which this could be shown apart from undertaking an exercise in forensic accounting – for example, if the alleged expenditure on credit card bills for a particular month was unusually high compared with the expenditure for other months, that would raise a red flag.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In summary, I allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 5, and disallow his request in respect of Items 6 – 10.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery (SUM 959)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I come now to the Wife’s application for discovery. Her application was categorised under two headers with the following items:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Under the header “1<sup>st</sup> Request for Discovery”, Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Under the header “2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery”, Items 3, 6, 7, and 8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For clarity and ease of reference, I will refer to the various items in the order as set out in the summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1<sup>st</sup> Request for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Item 1 was the Wife’s request for dental reports. This stemmed from an incident where the Wife had allegedly punched the Husband in the face and damaged his teeth. The Husband had stated, subsequently, that he would like to claim, from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets, a sum of money for the dental work. This was what motivated the Wife’s request – she wanted the dental reports to show that the Husband had been lying about being punched in the face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I disallow the request. The dental reports were irrelevant to the disposal of the ancillary matters. If the Husband wished to make such a claim from the share of matrimonial assets, it was for him to adduce such evidence in support of his claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Item 2 was a police report that the Husband had made against the Wife in which he accused her of embezzlement. Mr Robert argued, in oral submissions, that the Wife wanted disclosure of the report to test the veracity of the Husband’s claims. This was because the Husband had, in his AOM, recounted an incident where he had deposited $35,000 into one of their accounts, and that sum of money had been withdrawn the next day. When he questioned the Wife about it, she denied having withdrawn that sum, and that the bank had made a mistake. As a result, the Husband had “made a police report for embezzlement on the [Wife’s] part”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I disallow the Wife’s request. The police report was clearly irrelevant to the disposal of ancillary matters. At best, that report would only show that the Husband had made a complaint that some $35,000 had been disbursed from the parties’ accounts. It would not show who had taken the money, or where the money had gone. Insofar as the Wife had stated that she wanted to “see what exactly did the [Husband] report her to the Singapore Police Force for, if at all”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> I would add that curiosity is not a basis for disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Items 4 and 5 on the list was a request for statements from the Husband’s bank account with Bank of the West for the months starting 14 August 2022 and 14 September 2022. Mr Robert argued that it was a coincidence that the Husband did not have the statements for these two months. Before August 2022, parties had a huge argument because the Wife had discovered that the Husband had been soliciting for sex online. The Husband had then filed for divorce on 28 of September 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In response, Ms Liaw referred me to a screenshot exhibited in the Husband’s affidavit filed on 24 April 2024. That screenshot showed a list of available statements, and did not include the months of August and September, which were the two months that the Wife was seeking disclosure of. Mr Robert’s rejoinder was that the screenshot was not conclusive proof that the statements did not exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 4 and 5. These documents are clearly relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters. It would be useful for the court hearing the ancillary matter, as well as the Wife, to have a picture of the Husband’s financial circumstances shortly before the divorce was filed: <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and Other Cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> at [19]. In any event, if it is the Husband’s case that he does not have, or is unable to obtain these documents, he must provide his reasons, supported by the necessary documentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Items 9 and 10 related to the Husband’s insurance documents. Mr Robert argued that these documents were relevant to ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets. In addition, Mr Robert highlighted that the Husband’s response to the Wife’s initial request for documents was that he had no other insurance policies. The Husband later changed his tune and claimed that he could not disclose the documents relating to his insurance policies in the US as they were confidential in nature. Mr Robert also argued, on the assumption that the Husband was refusing disclosure of the insurance documents because they were confidential according to US law, that because the Husband had chosen Singapore as the forum for the divorce, it is Singapore law, and not US law that applies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In response, Ms Liaw stated that the Husband’s position was that there was an insurance policy that was in the Wife’s name. Apart from that, the Husband only had medical insurance which reimbursed him for medical claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 9 and 10. Whether there are any insurance policies in the Husband’s name is indeed a relevant issue for the disposal of ancillary matters: (see <em>eg</em>: <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0520.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520</a> at [27]; <em>UMU v UMT and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22962-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 504</a> at [21] – [23]; <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> at [27] – [28] and [38]). As for the contention that the documents could not be disclosed because they were allegedly confidential under US law, there was, in any event, no evidence before me to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Item 11 was the Wife’s request for statements for all of the Husband’s credit and debit cards as well as supplementary cards for the period 2018 – 2023. The Wife asked for these documents because the Husband had asked her to produce documentary evidence showing that she had repaid the monthly credit card charges on the Citibank card.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I disallow the request in respect of Item 11. The disclosure of 5 years’ worth of credit card statements was not necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters or for saving costs. It would only enable parties to undertake an exercise in forensic accounting in order to trace every penny that had been spent during that time. As I have mentioned above (at [14] – [15]), if the issue in dispute concerns the alleged dissipation of matrimonial assets, this can be ascertained by other means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Item 3 was a request for statement from the Husband’s Bank of the West account for the month of June 2020. Given Ms Liaw’s confirmation, during the hearing, that the Husband would be disclosing these statements, I make no order in respect of this item.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Item 6 was a request for statements from the same Bank of the West account as set out in Item 3 for the period April 2023 to date. The Wife wanted statements for this bank account for the period after interim judgment had been granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Mr Robert argued that these documents should be disclosed because there was a sum of USD $547,518.54 that was missing from the Husband’s 401k account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This sum may have been hidden away in the Husband’s Bank of the West account, after interim judgment had been entered, but there was no way to know for sure unless the statements for this account for the period April 2023 to date were provided. These bank statements were the final missing piece in the puzzle that would allow the Wife to ascertain where the money had gone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In response, Ms Liaw characterised the Wife’s request as a fishing expedition. These documents, which painted a picture of the Husband’s account after interim judgment had been entered, was not necessary in light of the principle that the pool of matrimonial assets was to be determined at the date of the interim judgment. Ms Liaw further argued that the disclosure of these documents should not be ordered in the interest of expediting matters and saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I will allow the request in respect of Item 6. This was no fishing expedition. Mr Robert had referred me to a document, which was the Husband’s Retirement Savings Statement from Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. That statement was for the period from 10 October 2014 to 1 October 2023. It is disclosed that the sum of USD $547,518.54 had been withdrawn.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> That statement, which also covers the immediate period after interim judgment had been obtained, does not provide a breakdown of when the sums had been withdrawn. If this sum had indeed been withdrawn to the Husband’s Bank of the West account after interim judgment had been entered, the statements for this period, which the Wife was seeking, would reflect that. It was thus clear to me that the disclosure of Item 6 was indeed relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I come now to Item 7. This was a request for the Husband’s US 401k yearly account statements for the period 2014 – 2023. As mentioned above, there was a sum of USD $547,518.54 that had been withdrawn. Mr Robert argued that disclosure of the Husband’s 401k yearly statements would enable them to pinpoint when the withdrawals had taken place and serve the relevant requests for interrogatories and further discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Ms Liaw’s response was that ordering disclosure would place an undue burden on the Husband given that the documents sought for spanned over a decade. In any event, the Husband had already produced the statements for the 401k account that were available to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, Ms Liaw pointed to a 401k account statement that was addressed to both the Husband and the Wife. Because the Wife had been named in the report, she too could get information regarding the coming and goings of the 401k account. Mr Robert’s response to this point was that the Wife could not ask for the 401k account statements as her name had been removed from those accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It was clear to me that the Wife wanted the 401k account statements to track down the sum of USD $547,518.54 that had been withdrawn. That said, the request for some 10 years’ worth of statements was, perhaps, framed a little too broadly. I will, instead, order that the Husband state the accounts to which this sum of USD $547,518.54 had been disbursed to and disclose any documentation evidencing the transfer of this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn now to Item 8. This was a request for statements for the statements of a Bank of the West Account for the period 2020 – 2023. The Husband claimed, in his response to the Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> Request for Interrogatories, that he could not provide these account statements because they belonged to one Mr X. It is disclosed that Mr X is the Husband’s brother-in-law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     This appeared to be, in essence, a request for discovery against a non-party. In this connection, Rule 71 of the FJR 2014 sets out the mechanism by which parties can seek discovery against a non-party. Mr Robert, to his credit, candidly acknowledged that if the account indeed belonged to Mr X, the proper thing to do as a matter of procedure was to follow Rule 71 – but this could not be done because they did not know where Mr X lived, and so could not effect service. Notwithstanding this, Mr Robert argued that Item 8 should be allowed because there was a possibility that Mr X was helping the Husband conceal assets that had been dissipated from the matrimonial pool. Mr Robert also alluded to the possibility that the account did not belong to Mr X when he raised the possibility of the Husband being directed to write to the Bank of the West to confirm that this account did not belong to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I will disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 8. I did not think it was open to me to order the Husband to disclose documents that, on the face of the evidence in the affidavits before me, appeared to belong to a third-party, especially given that Rule 71 provides a mechanism by which such documents can be sought. This, however, does not mean that I accept that the Husband’s statement, that this account belongs to his brother-in-law, is true. The Husband is to provide the necessary documents to show that this account is not in his name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I therefore make the following orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In respect of <b>SUM 1317</b>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in S/N 5 of Annexure A of this application, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power.

If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In respect of the Bank of the West account listed under S/N 8 under the header “2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery” of this application, the Husband is to provide the necessary and relevant documentation to support his claim that the account is not in his name. If the Husband is unable to furnish these documents, he is to state the reasons why, together with the supporting documentation for his explanation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In addition to the above, parties are to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     File and serve their submissions in respect of costs for SUM 959 and SUM 1317 by 29<sup>th</sup> May 2024, limited to 3 pages each; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Compliance affidavits are to be filed by 25<sup>th</sup> June 2024, 5pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I conclude with one observation. I was given the faint impression that at least one of the requests for discovery was motivated by the fact that the other party had also asked that the same documents be disclosed. It bears emphasising that in deciding whether to file applications for discovery, parties must always ask themselves whether the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the disposal of ancillary hearings. They must resist the temptation to engage in tit-for-tat. The Family Court is not a gladiatorial arena, and the rules of procedure are certainly not weapons to be used against the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     It remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance and able arguments during the hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1) at para 1(a).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s AOM at para 13(f).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Skeletal Submissions at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Skeletal Submissions at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 959 at p 406.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 959 at p 406.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit filed in support of SUM 959 at para 26.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Guardianship of Infants Act – Custody care and control of child"],"date":"2024-06-11","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating summons OSG 41/2023","title":"WYE v WYF","citation":"[2024] SGFC 38","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31612-SSP.xml","counsel":["Both parties appear self-represented"],"timestamp":"2024-06-18T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan","html":"<root><head><title>WYE v WYF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYE <em>v</em> WYF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31612-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 38</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Originating summons OSG 41/2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">11 June 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Both parties appear self-represented </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYE — WYF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Guardianship of Infants Act</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Custody care and control of child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">11 June 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Sheik Mustafa Abu Hassan:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       In this case the plaintiff is the Father, and the defendant is the Mother of a child. I shall refer to them collectively as “the parents”. It was an application by a Father to be granted shared care and control of the child; or else to be granted liberal access to the child. The Mother contested the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both parties appeared in court not represented by counsel. I heard both parties and ordered a custody evaluation to be done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After receiving and considering the report, I ordered that both parents are to have joint custody of the child. I ordered that the care and control of the child be shared between the parents, with the Father to have care and control of the child during the following periods:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>a.     Weekly:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_A\"></a>(A)       from 4pm to 6pm every Monday and Wednesday,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_B\"></a>(B)       every Sunday from 8am to 12pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>b.     Special occasions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b-p3_A\"></a>(A)       alternate public holidays staring from the next public holiday i.e. Good Friday from 4pm to 8pm,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b-p3_B\"></a>(B)       every Chinese New Year eve from 4pm to 8pm,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b-p3_C\"></a>(C)       every second day of Chinese New Year from 10am to 2pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>c.     Each party shall not by herself/himself, her/his agents or her/his servants, bring the child out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the other party or an Order of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother appeals against my decision. I state my reasons below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Father works in Singapore on a foreign passport as an engineer. He is awaiting the outcome of a permanent residency application. He has been residing in Singapore since 2008 at the age of 17 years and obtained a diploma in construction engineering, and later a degree at NUS.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother is a Singapore citizen. She is a nurse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The parents began a romantic relationship in 2020, and the Mother became pregnant. They agreed not to terminate the pregnancy, and they married in February 2021. The parents agreed to live together and entered into a tenancy agreement for an apartment. At that time, the Mother was not employed, so it was agreed that the Father would be responsible for rent and utilities, and that his mother would live with them to help look after the Mother and the child. They moved in to the apartment in May 2021 with the Father’s mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Their child was born in June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father’s mother returned to China. The parents agreed that the Father would hire a domestic worker to replace the assistance from the Father’s mother. As the Mother was then still unemployed, the Father undertook this expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The relationship between the parents deteriorated. They quarrelled and said cruel things to each other. In April 2022, there was such a quarrel. The Mother claims that the Father was violent, which the Father denies. The police came. The Father left the apartment. The Mother applied for a protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father claims that he was refused entry to the apartment and was not allowed to visit the child. He claims that he nevertheless continued to pay the rent for the apartment, household expenses and the domestic worker’s salary. He complains that he has to incur additional costs for his own accommodation. He alleges that in June 2022 the Mother called him and told him that he could visit the child only if he paid her an agreed sum of money for each visit because she was unemployed and needed money more than what he had been giving her as agreed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father agreed. He paid an additional $1,151.75 in July and $1,714.20 in August in order to visit the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In November 2022, in spite of the Father’s contesting, this court granted the Mother a personal protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother sent a message to the Father requesting him to sign documents for simplified divorce proceedings and a housing loan application. The Father continued to pay to the Mother for his visits to the child. In December 2023, he could no longer afford the payments and ceased making the additional payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother refused to allow the Father to visit the child. The Mother sent messages that if the Father does not sign the divorce agreement and loan documents he will not be able to see the child forever. The Husband did not comply. In February 2023, the Mother sent a message that she would not allow him to see the child forever.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In March 2023, the Father filed this proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother, who also represents herself, filed a short affidavit in reply. She claims that the Father threatened multiple times to kill the child or throw the child out the window whenever he was angry with the Mother. She says that she is the only caregiver of the child since its birth, and that the Father does not know how to care for the child at all, as when he showed a video to the child when it was merely 2-3 months old, and as when he fed milk to the child until its tummy was full of air. She says these are not good for the baby’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother says that the Father had stopped giving her money since December 2022, and that she had to pay all the expenses including rent, the domestic worker, and the child. She says her salary is only $3,000 and she needs to use a credit card to survive every month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother adds that she wanted to purchase a HDB flat but the Father cancelled it, and this caused her and the child to have no place to stay. She was depressed as the landlord wanted to increase the rent and she did not have enough money. She has no support from anyone. She was very depressed and desperate every day. she works as a nurse full time and it is a stressful and tiring job. Due to the Father, she experienced much depression and stress and even wanted to kill herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother argues that there will be no one to bring the child to see the Father. She had separated from the Father since April 2022 and has not contacted or met him since then. She claims that sometimes the Father comes to the apartment to disturb her life. She would call the police to chase him away. She hopes for a divorce and says that she will take care of the child herself. she does not wish to attend any court counselling except for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     At the hearing before me on 12 July 2023, the Mother flatly declared that she would allow the Father to have access to the child if he signs the divorce documents and give her maintenance. The Father says that it was not reasonable and did not agree to the demand. The Mother countered that after she moved to another address she did not inform anyone about the location, but the Father came and harassed her. She declared that she refuses to sponsor the Father’s long term visit pass. The Father replies that he is not on a long term pass, but on an S-pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     After hearing the parties, I ordered for a custody evaluation report to be submitted to the court. I indicated that in the meantime the child will continue to reside with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father enquired about access in the meantime. I asked the Mother for her view on this. The Mother responded that she had no proposal and did not want the Father to visit. I ordered that the Father was to have supervised access to the child at a divorce specialist support agency twice a month for 8 sessions, and a report be submitted to me thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On 3 January 2024, the hearing resumed. The Father was absent. I informed the Mother that the court had received the custody evaluation report, but the DSSA report was not yet received. I adjourned the case pending the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     On 20 March 2024, the hearing resumed. I had received and considered the contents of both the custody evaluation report and the DSSA report. I made the orders that the Mother appeals against.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The child continues to live with the Mother. There is a domestic worker living with the Mother and child. There is no indication that the living arrangements are in any way detrimental to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I find that the child ought to continue to reside with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The parents do not reside together anymore. With the personal protection order in place, the risk of violence to the Mother is low. However, the parents appear to have difficulties in emotional regulation, and there is a risk that aggressive conflict could recur during the near future whilst the parents undergo divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I find that the Mother’s allegations that the Father is a danger to the child is not proved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Mother exhibits strong gatekeeping behaviour. She has threatened to cut the Father off from the child. I find that it is therefore in the child’s best interest that it is explicitly stated that the Father has joint custody of the child with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The prognosis for the Mother allowing the Father to have access to the child without unreasonable conditions is poor. I therefore find that it is best that the Father be allowed to have parenting time with the child in the form of regular and fixed periods of care and control that are expressly specified by the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I fix these times to be on two weekdays from 4 to 6pm, to enable the Father to have dinner with the child, as well as on Sundays from 8am to 12pm every week. In addition, I also order the Father to have care and control on aternate public holidays staring from the next public holiday i.e. Good Friday 2023 from 4pm to 8pm, every Chinese New Year eve from 4pm to 8pm, and every second day of Chinese New Year from 10am to 2pm.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Discovery","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2024-06-07","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)","title":"WYA v WYB","citation":"[2024] SGFC 37","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31611-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff","Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-06-18T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WYA v WYB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WYA <em>v</em> WYB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31611-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 37</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 760 of 2023 (Summons No 1063 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">07 June 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Lim Shu Fen (JS Law Chambers LLP) for the plaintiff; Charmaine Chua Qi Shan (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WYA — WYB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">7 June 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are the facts as I have found them in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). Parties were married on 30 October 1999. They had two children. It was the Wife who filed for divorce on 22 February 2023, on grounds that the Husband had behaved in a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After the filing of the divorce, interim judgment was obtained on 22 August 2023. Parties subsequently filed their Affidavit of Means and Assets (“AOMs”). Thereafter, parties were directed to exchange their voluntary requests for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife, being dissatisfied with the extent of the Husband’s disclosure, took out the present application in SUM 1063 of 2024 (“SUM 1063”). I heard SUM 1063 on 28 May 2024. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Request for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife had sought discovery in respect of 12 categories of documents. At the hearing, her counsel, Ms Lim, confirmed that she would not be proceeding with Items 2, 6, 7. I will therefore deal with the rest of the items which were proceeded with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Item 1 was a request for the Husband to provide documentary evidence to prove that his insurance policy with Prudential was still in force, or whether it had matured or been surrendered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Ms Lim argued that these documents were relevant and necessary for the ancillary matters hearing. She explained that these documents were needed to ascertain exactly what had happened with this particular insurance policy. That was because the Husband had, in his response to the Wife’s first request for discovery, stated that he could not remember what had happened with this policy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, in his response to the Wife’s second request for discovery, the Husband stated that the policy had been terminated in the same year that it had been purchased because he did not find the coverage suitable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In response, counsel for the Husband, Ms Chua, argued that the documents were not within the Husband’s possession, custody or power to obtain, and that in any case, given that many years had passed since the policy had been terminated, it would be impractical to order that the Husband produce these documents, or to attempt to obtain them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I allow the request in respect of Item 1. There can be no quarrel as to the relevance or necessity of this item. It would allow the Wife to ascertain what had happened to this policy, and take a position on whether it too should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In any case, it was not open to the Husband to sidestep his obligation to give disclosure with the mere assertion that such documents were not in his possession, or that he could not obtain those documents. In that connection, I find it particularly puzzling that the Husband had initially stated that he could not recall such an insurance policy, but was later able to state that it had been terminated in the same year it had been purchased.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I turn now to Item 3. There were two parts to this request. The first was that the Husband disclose his CPF statements evidencing the investments that he had made using funds from his CPF ordinary account. The second, was that the Husband provide an updated statement showing the current value of all such investments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Ms Lim argued that the disclosure of this document was relevant and necessary to determine how much money had been taken from the Husband’s CPF ordinary account for investments. She said this document was necessary because the documents which the Husband had disclosed was insufficient for the Wife to determine exactly how much the Husband had taken from his CPF account and used for investments. This was an issue that was directly relevant to determining the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband had disclosed three documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The first was a statement from First Sentier Investors which showed the value of his holdings of his shares in various funds as of 31 December 2023. The second, was a CPF statement showing the amounts available to the Husband for investment. The third was a statement of the Husband’s CPF Investment account with DBS dated 16 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Ms Chua made two points in response. First, that the Husband had already disclosed all the documents in his possession, custody and power. Second, that the documents which had already been disclosed did paint a full picture of all the investments which the Husband had funded using his CPF money – it was therefore not necessary to order the Husband to produce the documents which the Wife sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In respect of Item 3, I will only order that the Husband provide an updated copy of his holdings in his CPF investment account with DBS as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2023. I did not think that it was relevant or necessary, for the disposal of ancillary matters, to trace exactly how much money the Husband had taken from his CPF accounts for investment. The more pertinent issue, in my view, was the value of such investments that had been made by the Husband using his CPF money. To that end, it was clear to me, based on the documents disclosed by the Husband which I have described above, that further investments had indeed been made. It was therefore relevant and necessary that an updated copy be provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I come now to Items 4 and 5. I shall deal with them together. The Wife had gone through the Husband’s credit card statements. There were a number of transactions for amounts that had been either debited from, or credited to his credit card. The Wife is asking that the Husband disclose the documents supporting why such transactions had been made. She is also asking that if these transactions were for trading or investment purposes, that the Husband provide monthly statements for those trading or investment accounts for the past three years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Insofar as the Wife’s request for documents to support the various transactions that had been made was concerned, this appeared to me to be a rather roundabout way of asking for documents relating to the Husband’s alleged trading account(s). As I pointed out to Ms Lim during the hearing, if what she was really after were the monthly statement of accounts of the Husband’s trading accounts, then it was unnecessary to ask for documents evidencing the transfer of funds to and from this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In light of the above, I disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Items 4 and 5. Instead, the Husband is to disclose the monthly statements of any trading accounts in his name from 2021 to present. In this vein, I note that Ms Chua had argued that the Husband did not dispute that he had a trading account, but it was closed in 2021. Further, the Husband having forgotten his account number and password, could not obtain or produce any statements. However, as Ms Lim quite rightly pointed out, if the Husband is indeed unable to regain access to his trading account, he should provide the necessary documents to support his assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I turn now to Item 8. Ms Lim explained that this request was based on the Husband’s assertion that he would give his parents $8000 each month. This was broken down into transfers of $3000, $3000 and $2000. Insofar as Item 8 was concerned, the Wife wanted documents from the Husband in relation to the monthly transfers of $2000. The Husband had disclosed documents and explained the transfers of $3000, but there were scant details, if any, concerning this monthly transfer of $2000. In other words, there was nothing to demonstrate that the Husband was indeed giving his parents that sum of money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Ms Lim submitted that these documents were relevant and necessary to allowing the Wife to trace where this monthly transfers of $2000 had gone. This tracing exercise was necessary to determine if the Husband had other undisclosed bank accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Ms Chua’s response was that it was not necessary to order discovery because the regularity of the transfers which started in 2021 supported the Husband’s assertion that these sums were indeed meant for his parents. In any case, ordering disclosure would incur unnecessary costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 8. It was clear to me that these documents would allow the Wife to determine whether these transfers of $2000 were clearly meant for the Husband’s parents, or whether this sum had been squirreled away into undisclosed bank account(s). This was directly relevant to the issue of division of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to address Item 9 which was a request for monthly bank accounts of Company X. Ms Lim argued that these documents were relevant and necessary for determining the Husband’s earning capacity and the assessment of his income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given that the documents sought were company documents, the principles governing the disclosure of company documents are relevant, and apply in the present case. As was stated in <em>ACW v ACX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0053.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 53</a> (at [20] citing <em>B v B (Matrimonial Proceedings: Discovery</em> [1978] Fam 181 at 193 – 194):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">20    More directly, a helpful summary of the relevant principles relating to discovery of documents belonging to a company of which the husband was a director and shareholder can be found in B v B at 193–194:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The documents of a company are in the legal possession of the company. If they are or have been in the actual physical possession of a director who is a party to litigation they must be disclosed by that director, if relevant to the litigation, even though he holds them as servant or agent of the company in his capacity as an officer of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    If the director who is a party to the litigation does not have physical possession of the documents, the question of fact of whether the documents are within the power of the director arises. “Power” in this context means “the enforceable right to inspect or obtain possession or control of the document” in the personal capacity of the director. This is in contradistinction to the right to inspect vested in a director in his capacity as a director. Without the consent of the company, the director has no right to inspect the documents. Much will depend on the share structure of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)     <b>If the company is the alter ego of such a director so that he has unfettered control of the company’s affairs, he must disclose and produce all relevant documents in the possession of the company.</b> Where the company is not the alter ego of a director, the factors to be considered are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    the extent of the shareholding of the husband;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   whether it amounts to control of the company;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   whether the minority shareholders are adverse to him;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iv)   how the board of directors is constituted; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(v)    whether there is any objection by the board to disclosure of any of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    A very wide range of issues are relevant in proceedings relating to ancillary matters. The court has to assess what the husband is shown to have, but also what could reasonably be made available to him. In many cases, audited accounts of companies of which the husband is a shareholder will be sufficient, together with full disclosure of all the husband’s personal financial records. But there are cases when the court will go behind company accounts and order discovery of company books and documents. It is not usual, however, for the court to take this course unless there is evidence before it from accountants or other experts that the published accounts of the company cannot be relied upon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Where relevant documents in the possession of a company are disclosed by a director as being in his custody or power, the court has a discretion whether or not to order production of them. In exercising the discretion, the court will have regard to all the circumstances and balance the relevance and importance of the documents and the hardship likely to be caused to the wife by non-production against any prejudice to the husband and third parties likely to be caused by production.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    It has not hitherto been the practice of the court to order production of company documents to which the board of directors objects on affidavit, provided that the court is satisfied that the objection is not contrived for the purpose of frustrating the powers of the court. The court will not in the exercise of its discretion order parties to do that which they have no power to do. The court will not order production unless it is satisfied that production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the issues between the parties or for saving costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Where the wife cannot obtain documents on discovery, she may be able to apply for leave to issue a subpoena against the secretary or other officers of the company to produce relevant documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In short, if the Husband has physical possession of the company documents which are sought, he must produce them. If the Husband does not have physical possession of those documents, then it must be shown that those documents are within his power – meaning that the Husband has the right to inspect or obtain possession of the document. This can be established in a situation where, for example, it can be shown that the company is the alter ego of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In this connection, Ms Lim argued that Company X was indeed the alter ego of the Husband because he had intermingled funds belonging to the company with his own account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, as I had pointed out to Ms Lim, and as I had observed in <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> (“<em>WWS</em>”) at [44], there is a subtle difference between the idea of a company being an alter ego in the context of discovery proceedings as opposed to piercing the corporate veil. The former is concerned with whether the party in question has control over documents such that they can be compelled to disclose them in an application for discovery. The latter, however, deals with questions of liability. Given this difference, I did not think that the intermingling of funds, by itself, was sufficient for me to draw the inference that Company X was indeed the Husband’s alter ego such that he had control over the documents that were sought. In any event, the Husband was not the sole shareholder and director of Company X. As stated in his reply affidavit to this summons, his father, who was the other director, held 80% of the shares.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Apart from this, Ms Lim had pointed to the fact that the Husband had disclosed some of Company X’s bank account statements as proof that these bank statements were indeed in the Husband’s physical possession or that he could readily obtain them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> There is much force to this argument. I noted that the Husband had indeed, in his voluntary responses to the Wife’s request for discovery, disclosed some of Company X’s bank account statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In any event, the more pertinent question was whether these documents were relevant or necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matters or for saving costs: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> (“<em>VTQ</em>”) at [25] – [27]. I was not satisfied that they were. Insofar as Ms Lim had argued that the bank statements were needed to assess the Husband’s income and earning capacity, I note that the Husband had already disclosed his income tax statements,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and also provided the annual reports of Company X. These documents should provide the Wife with sufficient details as to the Husband’s earning capacity and income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 9.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I turn now to Item 10. This was the request:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to provide all relevant documents evidencing payment of director fees for [Company X] to all directors, including documents evidencing the transfers (whether by way of cheque or bank transfer) to all directors. For the director’s fees received by the Defendant, the Defendant is to provide his bank account statement evidencing the receipt of such Director’s Fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the event such a bank account is undisclosed, the Defendant is to provide monthly bank account statements (together with transaction history) for the said bank account for the past three (3) years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Ms Lim explained that the Wife wanted these documents because she suspected the Husband of dissipating assets which should belong to the matrimonial pool. She pointed to three transfers, totalling some $330,000 which were labelled as “directors fees” from the Husband’s bank account to the company’s bank account. There was a subsequent withdrawal of $330,000 from the company’s account. Given the proximity in time of these transfers to the divorce, Ms Lim argued that these documents were relevant and necessary to determining whether assets had indeed been dissipated from the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The problem with this request was that the documents sought were company documents. And as I have found, above (at [26]), Company X was not the alter ego of the Husband. Evidence in the affidavits only showed that the Husband appeared to be able to obtain the bank statements of Company X because he had voluntarily disclosed those (above at [27]). There was therefore nothing before me to show that the Husband had possession, custody or power over these documents which were sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the circumstances, I disallow the request in Item 10.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I turn now to Item 11. This was a request for documents relating to the surrender of two insurance policies in their elder daughter’s name. Ms Lim argued that these documents were necessary to determine the proceeds received from the surrender of these policies, and to allow the Wife to make the necessary submissions for those sums to be added into the pool of matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In response, Ms Chua argued that the Husband could not disclose these documents because no surrender documents had been provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I will allow the request in respect of Item 11. It was clear to me that these documents were relevant and necessary for the ancillary matters hearing, <em>viz</em>, the issue on the division of matrimonial assets. If the Husband is unable to obtain these documents, he must explain, in his affidavit, why he is unable to do so, and to provide the necessary documentary evidence in support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Item 12 was a request for the Husband to produce documents to support his answers to the interrogatories. I shall, in the paragraphs that follow, deal with the request in Item 12 along with the Wife’s request for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Request for Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     There were four items on the list. Ms Lim stated that the Wife would not be pursuing her request in relation to Item 3. I will therefore deal with the rest of the items that had been proceeded with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     This was the request in respect of Item 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For the following withdrawals in the Defendant’s POSB Passbook Savings Account No. xxx-xxxxx-x from 9 October 2022 to 13 May 2022:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Withdrawals</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Withdrawal of $55,000 on 1 February 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Withdrawal of $200,000 on 5 February 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Withdrawal of $130,000 on 6 February 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    Withdrawal of $20,000 on 2 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to state the following in relation to each of the withdrawals listed above:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    The purpose of the withdrawal;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   If the withdrawal is a transfer to another bank account, to state the bank account details including the name of the bank, bank account number and owner of the bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to provide documents in relation to such payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     These were the answers the Husband had given in his response to the Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> Request for interrogatories:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Withdrawal of $55,000 on 1 February 2023:</b> This sum comprises partial payments made by customers of our client’s company, and our client transferred these payments in a lump sum to the company. Kindly find enclosed at Tab 17 the relevant page of the company’s bank account statement;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Withdrawal of $200,000 on 5 February 2023:</b> This is payment of director fees to our client’s father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Withdrawal of $130,000 on 6 February 2023:</b> This is payment of director fees to our client’s father</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Withdrawal of $20,000 on 2 March 2023:</b> This sum comprises partial payments made by customers of our client’s company, and our client transferred these payments in a lump sum to the company. Kindly find enclosed at Tab Z the relevant page of the company’s bank account statement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In respect of Items 1(b) and (c), that is linked to Item 10 of the Wife’s request for discovery (see [30] – [33] above). The Wife suspects that this sum of $330,000 was not payment for director’s fees. That is because the sum of $330,000 was withdrawn from the company’s bank account via cheque.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Where interrogatories are concerned, it is trite that I am only concerned as to the sufficiency, and not the truth of the answers that had been given: <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> (“<em>UJN</em>”) at [12]. In the present case, I am satisfied that the answers given were sufficient. The Husband had explained the reasons for the transfer, and also provided the bank account details which the Wife had sought. While I note that, in respect of Items 1(b) and 1(c), the Husband did not, in his original answer, state the bank account that the money had been transferred to, he had done so in his reply affidavit to this summons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Having said that, I note that the Wife’s <em>true</em> concern related to the sum of $330,000 that had been withdrawn via cheque on 6 February 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I will therefore order that the Husband explain why that withdrawal had been made and state who the cheque had been made in favour of. The Husband is also to provide the details of the bank account into which the cheque had been cashed in. The Husband shall also disclose the relevant documents in relation to this transaction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I come now to Item 2. Ms Lim had confirmed that she was not proceeding with Item 2(h). This request required the Husband to explain a series of withdrawals from his POSB passbook savings account. Ms Lim argued that the answers provided by the Husband were insufficient because he had not provided documents in support of his answer. She further argued that the sufficiency of an answer must be assessed with regard to whether disclosure had been given where there is a corresponding request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I did not agree with this argument advanced by Ms Lim. For one, as the court had observed in <em>UJN</em>, discovery and interrogatories are two means by which parties may obtain information that would allow them to build their substantive arguments at the trial. In this vein, I did not think it could be said that the sufficiency of an answer should be assessed based on whether disclosure had been given in response to a corresponding request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Having read the answers, I was of the view that they were sufficient. The Husband had attempted to, despite saying he could not recall the exact details, explain the purposes of each of these transfers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I will therefore disallow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 2. However, given that there was a corresponding request for discovery, I will order that the Husband produce documents to support his answers given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I come now to Item 4. This was the request:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Inward Telegraphic Transfers dated 21 September 2018 and 7 December 2018, the Defendant is to state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The reason for receiving such a payment</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    The source of such monies</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    In the event such monies were received as a result of the Defendant’s investments or trading activities, the Defendant is to state which investment or trading account this is in relation to</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Outward Telegraphic Transfers dated 25 September 2018 and 3 October 2018, the Defendant is to state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    The reason for sending such payments</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    What has become of the monies</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    In the event the monies were deposited into an investment or trading account, the Defendant is to state which investment or trading account this is in relation to</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Specifically, in relation to the transfer of USD 50,000 on 3 October 2018, the Defendant is to state who [A] is</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to provide documents evidencing the above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This was the Husband’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our client instructs that the payment received in the Inward Telegraphic Transfers are withdrawals from his overseas trading account. As the account was closed in 2020, our client is unable to access to the said account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our client instructs that the payment sent in the Outward Telegraphic Transfers are deposits into his overseas trading account. As the account was closed in 2020, our client is unable to access to the said account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our client instructs that [A] is an overseas trader.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Having read the response, I am of the view that it was indeed insufficient, insofar as Items 4(a) – (f) were concerned. This is because there were three parts to each question that had been posed. The Husband, however, had not directly addressed each and every part of the question. For example, the Husband was required to specify the investment or trading account in question, but he did not do so in that he did not give the name or account number of those trading accounts, and merely referred to them as his “overseas trading account”. The Husband was also asked what had become of the monies that were sent via Outward Telegraphic Transfers – he had only stated that those monies were deposited into his overseas trading account but did not disclose what had happened to those monies when the account was closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I will therefore order that the Husband answer Item 4(a) – (f). As for Item 4(g), I am satisfied that the Husband had provided a sufficient answer. Given that there is a corresponding request for documents, I will also order that the Husband disclose any and all documents in support of his answers to these interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I therefore make the following orders in respect of SUM 1063:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatories as set out in S/No. 4(a) – (f) in annexed Schedule B, as well as the following interrogatory:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Explain the withdrawal of $330,000 via cheque from Company X’s accounts on 6 February 2023.

They were married three years later, on 23 May 2003. They had two children. The Husband is a British expatriate. He used to run his own business providing consultancy services to clients who were seeking funding for their projects.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Wife, on the other hand, works as a general manager.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       As to how the marriage broke down, details can be found in the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). It paints a picture of how the relationship between the parties deteriorated to a point beyond all hope of rescue or salvage. In this case, it was the Wife who filed for divorce on 2 September 2021. Interim judgment was obtained some 2 years later on 14 December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The next step in the proceedings, on the road to the hearing of the ancillary matters, was for parties to exchange their requests for discovery and interrogatories, and to provide voluntary disclosures to the same. Dissatisfied with the extent of disclosure provided by the Wife, the Husband took out SUM 1086/2024 (“SUM 1086”), which was his application for discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the application on 30 May 2024. During the hearing, the Husband confirmed that he was only proceeding with the items listed in Schedules A and B, and not Schedule C, which were annexed to SUM 1086.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       This is my decision in respect of SUM 1086.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is trite law that interrogatories as well as discovery should only be ordered if they are relevant and necessary for the disposal of matters at the ancillary hearing: <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> (“<em>UJN</em>”) at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> (“<em>VTQ</em>”) at [25] – [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       One other relevant principle is that the answer provided to an interrogatory only has to be sufficient – the truth of the answer provided does not concern me, and is a matter to be decided by the judge hearing the ancillary matters: <em>UJN</em> at [12]. In assessing the sufficiency of a response, it is important to not only look at the interrogatory posed, but also the response that had been given: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> (“<em>WWS</em>”) at [30].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is with these principles in mind that I turn now to deal with the Husband’s request as set out in Schedule A annexed to SUM 1086.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Item 1 was a request for the Wife to state the annual income she had earned for each year of the marriage from 2003 to 2024. I note that the Wife has stated, in her reply affidavit to this summons, her estimated income from employment from 2003 – 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s reason for pursuing this interrogatory was that he, having looked at the relevant documents, suspected the Wife of under-declaring her income. It is for this reason that he says this interrogatory is relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I disallow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 1. As I have mentioned (above at [7]), I am only concerned to the sufficiency of the answer, and not the truth of the answer given. Having read the Wife’s response, I am satisfied that the answer is indeed sufficient given that she had endeavoured to state her income over the course of the marriage. The Husband is, of course, entitled to disagree with the answer given, but this is a matter best ventilated before the judge hearing the ancillary matters: see <em>WWS</em> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I come now to Item 2. This was a request for the Wife to state those insurance policies that she had taken out after the commencement of the marriage which had matured before the date of divorce. The Wife was also requested to state the total premium paid, the date of maturity and the value received by the Wife for those policies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband explained that there was reason to suspect that the Wife had other insurance policies. He pointed to paragraph 22 of the Wife’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) where she had said that she had exercised all her insurance options. There was, however, no mention of such policies in the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”). The Husband thus asserts that there were other insurance policies which were exercised during the course of their marriage, which the Wife had not disclosed in any of her affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In response, counsel for the Wife, Ms Sharifah, argued that the Husband’s request should not be allowed because the Wife had already provided details of all her insurance policies in the AOM. Insofar as the Husband had mentioned the insurance policies at paragraph 22 of the Wife’s AEIC, those insurance policies were dated before the marriage, and so were not relevant to the hearing of ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will allow the request in respect of Item 2. It was clear to me that the existence of other such insurance policies would be relevant and necessary to determining the pool of matrimonial assets. I note that while the Wife has indeed disclosed a list of insurance policies in her AOM, those appear to be policies which are currently still in force. The Husband’s interrogatory, however, pertains to insurance policies which were taken out after the commencement of the marriage which have matured before their divorce. In that sense, the Husband has yet to receive an answer to the interrogatory that had been posed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As for Item 3, the Husband confirmed, during the hearing, that he was not pursuing his request in respect of Item 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I come now to the last request on the list: Item 4. This was the request as had been framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff claims she paid for half the groceries during our marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please explain the mechanism of how this was done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For example, did the Plaintiff pay for groceries one week and the Defendant the next week, etc</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband explained that while the Wife had asserted that she paid for half of the groceries, she had not provided details as to how this had been done. According to the Husband, the Wife was overstating her expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Ms Sharifah, in response, argued that this interrogatory was unnecessary because each party’s contributions could simply be proved by showing receipts. In any event, the Wife had also provided a breakdown at paragraph 10 of the affidavit in reply to SUM 1086.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I disallow the request in respect of Item 4. The mechanism by which the groceries had been paid for is, in my judgment, irrelevant to the disposal of the ancillary matters hearing. What is more crucial is whether there are receipts or bank statements to show who had actually paid for the groceries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I come now to the Husband’s application for discovery. There were 7 items on the list. During the course of the hearing, the Husband confirmed that he would not be proceeding in respect of Items 1, 3, and 5. I will deal with the rest of the items in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Item 2 was a request for the Wife to produce documents to support her answers given to Item 2 of the Husband’s request for interrogatories (above at [12]). The Husband has also asked that if the Wife asserts that there are no such insurance policies, evidence should be provided by way of an affidavit from the Wife’s insurance agents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In response, Ms Sharifah argued that I did not have the power to order discovery in respect of Item 2 because there was no <em>prima facie</em> evidence that such insurance policies were in existence: see <em>VTQ</em> at [64] citing <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the circumstances, I will allow the Husband’s request in respect of Item 2, but only to the extent that the Wife is to provide documents of any insurance policies which were taken out after the marriage, and which had matured before the divorce. If the Wife did indeed disclose in her subsequent response to Item 2 of the Husband’s request for interrogatories, these documents would, in my judgment, be relevant and necessary (see <em>UJN</em> at [10]) for determining the value of the insurance policies that should be added back into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the avoidance of doubt, I am not ordering the Wife to provide an affidavit from her insurance agents if she asserts that she has no such insurance policies. These insurance agents are non-parties to the present divorce suit. To that end, Rule 71 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 provides a mechanism by which discovery and interrogatories may be sought against a non-party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I will next deal with Items 4 and 7 together. Item 4 was a request for the Wife to produce documents evidencing the payment of half the grocery expenses during marriage. Item 7 was a similar request that the Wife provide documentary evidence to support the monthly expenses which she claims to have paid, particularly those relating to groceries, transport, mortgage and insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     During the hearing, the Husband clarified that he was not asking the Wife to produce receipts for the past 20 years. All he wanted was evidence for any six-month period between 2003 to 2011, and 2013 to 2019. The Husband further argued that without documentary evidence, there was no way in which he could show that the Wife had been inflating her expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, Ms Sharifah argued that this request should be denied – the matter of proving which party had actually borne the cost of such expenses was a matter to be taken up at the ancillary matters hearing. In addition, Ms Sharifah also made the point that it was impractical to order that the Wife produce receipts dating back to 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In response to Ms Sharifah’s characterisation of his application as a fishing expedition, the Husband replied that he was actually on a treasure hunt – he personally knew that the Wife had inflated her expenses but would be unable to prove it if he could not get hold of the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In deciding whether to order discovery, the court must “strike a balance between the importance and relevance of the documents and the hardship to the party seeking discovery which is likely to be caused by non-production, against any prejudice likely to be caused to the other party by ordering production of documents or the provision of information”: <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Having considered the arguments, I will only allow the request in respect of Items 4 and 7 to the extent that the Wife is to disclose any receipts or statements she may have to support her expenditure for the six-month period from June 2019 to December 2019. In doing so, I take into account, on the one hand, the Husband’s argument that without these documents, he will be unable to prove, one way or the other, that the Wife had inflated her expenses. On the other hand, I am also mindful that the scope and extent of discovery must also be constrained by practical considerations – the Wife would face enormous difficulties if ordered to produce receipts going too far back in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I come now to Item 6. This was a request for the Wife to provide copies of bank and credit card statements in her name, as well as those accounts in joint names with her for the period starting February 2019 to September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband explained that he had asked for statements starting from February 2019 because that was when the Wife allegedly had an affair – if there had been any serious thoughts as to divorce and dissipating assets, the paper trail would have begun from there. In response, Ms Sharifah argued that this request for documents was arbitrary and speculative. The Wife had already disclosed all relevant documents. In the bank statements that she had disclosed, there was no evidence that assets had been dissipated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I will allow the request in Item 6, but only to the extent that the Wife is to disclose her bank and credit card statements from February 2021 to September 2023. It is, in my judgment, indeed useful for the court hearing the ancillary matters, as well as the Husband, to obtain a picture of the Wife’s financial circumstances in the period leading up to the filing of divorce proceedings, as well as directly after divorce proceedings had been filed. I echo the views of the court in <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em> at [19]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>When a marriage is breaking down, there will usually be a proportionate decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances and financial arrangements</b>. I also recognise that <b>particularly in situations where divorce proceedings are contemplated, there will be an incentive for both parties to manage their financial affairs in such a manner that would make them opaque to the other party</b>, and in extreme cases, to dissipate and/or salt away the matrimonial assets which are in their control. I note, of course, that no such allegation of dissipation of assets has been made in this case by the wife against the husband—as yet. But I am nonetheless of the view that it would be useful for the court, as well as the wife, to have a picture of the husband’s financial circumstances just before the marriage broke down, during the break down of the marriage, and after the filing of divorce proceedings….</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall answer the interrogatories as set out in S/N 2 of Schedule A annexed to SUM 1086/2024 on affidavit, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Insurance policies which the Wife had taken out after the commencement of the marriage, and which had matured before the date of divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Any receipts or statements she may have to support her expenditure for the six-month period from June 2019 to December 2019</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Bank and credit card statements from February 2021 to September 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power.

I now set out my grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The writ was served on the Husband on 7 May 2024. The Husband filed his memorandum of appearance on 10 May 2024. According to the Family Justice Rules 2014, a defendant who has filed a memorandum of appearance must file a defence within 14 days after the expiry of time limited for the filing of the memorandum of appearance. This meant that the Husband had to file his Defence and Counterclaim by 29 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband, however, had applied for legal aid. He had exhibited, in his affidavit filed in support of SUM 1059, an email from the Legal Aid Bureau, acknowledging that his application for legal aid on 13 May 2024, and giving him an appointment for means testing on 20 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Because the Husband had applied for legal aid, s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (2020 Rev Ed) (“LAA”) was relevant. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Stay of proceedings upon making of application for legal aid</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17.—(1)    Where proceedings have been commenced and any party makes an application for legal aid, <b>the Director must, as soon as practicable after the application is made, notify the other party or each of the other parties, and file with the court in which the proceedings are pending, a notification of the making of the application</b>; and no fee is to be payable in respect of the filing of the notification.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)     <b>Where a notification under subsection (1) is filed in respect of any proceedings, the following apply unless the court (before which those proceedings are pending) orders otherwise:</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<b>a</b>)     <b>all steps in those proceedings are stayed for a period of 14 days after the date on which the notification is filed;</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<b>b</b>)     <b>during that period, the time fixed by or under any written law, for doing any act or taking any step in those proceedings, does not run.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    Despite subsection (2), the filing of the notification under subsection (1) does not prevent any of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the making of an interlocutory order for an injunction, or for the appointment of a receiver, a manager or a receiver and manager;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the making of an order to prevent the lapse of a caveat against dealings with land;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the making of any other order which, in the opinion of the court, is necessary to prevent an irremediable injustice;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the institution or continuance of proceedings to obtain, enforce or otherwise carry into effect an order mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), unless the court orders otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)     <b>The period mentioned in subsection (2)(a) may be reduced or extended by an order of the court.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The purpose of s 17 of the LAA may be gleaned from the Second Reading of the Legal Aid and Advice (Amendment) Bill. As the Senior Minister of State for Law, Mr Edwin Tong had explained (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, <em>Official Report</em> (19 November 2018) vol 94):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I would also like to assure the Member that where an applicant requires aid as a matter of urgency, for example, when an appeal is due to be filed, the Director may issue a Grant of Aid on a provisional basis, if the Director is of the view that the applicant is likely to satisfy the means test and is likely to have a reasonable ground for appealing against the decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">This Grant is typically valid for a period of three months and can be further extended if necessary. Under the Provisional Grant of Aid, the Bureau may assist the aided person with the filing of the Notice of Appeal. <b>In addition, the Director can also issue a notification under section 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act to stay the proceedings for a period of 14 days, whilst this is being done.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The purpose of s 17 of the LAA is to ensure that the person who has applied for legal aid whilst there are pending proceedings, is not prejudiced by his application for legal aid. The stay of proceedings effectively ensures that the applicant for legal aid can still comply with the procedural timelines, such as the filing of a notice of appeal, whilst his application for legal aid is being processed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the present case, although the Husband had applied for legal aid on 13 May 2024, when the matter came up before me for hearing, no notification had been filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This presented a problem. This stemmed from the fact that the stay under s 17 of the LAA would only take effect when the requisite notification had been filed with the court. Therefore, the crucial event was when that notification was filed. It bears emphasising that s 17 LAA only stipulates that the Director of Legal Aid is to file the notification as soon as practicable – the provision does not set out a deadline by which this must be done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Two scenarios presented themselves. If the Director of Legal Aid filed the notification by the 29<sup>th</sup> of March, which was the deadline for the Husband to file his Defence and Counterclaim, all would be well. The Husband would have an extension of 2 weeks, and this stay could be further extended by an order of court: s 17(4) of the LAA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     However, if the notification was filed <em>after</em> the 29<sup>th</sup> of May, the stay would not operate because the Husband would be out of time insofar as the deadlines for him to file and serve his Defence and Counterclaim was concerned. In other words, there was nothing on which the stay under s 17 of the LAA would operate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There was, therefore, some logic to the Husband’s application – one might say he was acting <em>ex abundanti cautela</em> – after all, he did not know when the Director of Legal Aid would file the notification set out in s 17 LAA, or whether he would even be granted legal aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that an extension of time, pursuant to Rule 15 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, should be granted. In granting this extension of time, I was also mindful that the Director of Legal Aid could file the notification after I had made the order and the effect this would have pursuant to s 17 of the LAA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband be granted an extension of time to file his Defence and Counterclaim for:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       2 weeks till 10 June 2024; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       To the date that the Director of Legal Aid files the Certificate under s 17 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>whichever was earlier; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Husband shall have liberty to apply.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit filed in support of SUM 1059 of 2024.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Discovery","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories – Sufficiency of Answer"],"date":"2024-05-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4868 of 2022 (Summons No 1012 of 2024)","title":"WXG v WXH","citation":"[2024] SGFC 32","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31582-SSP.xml","counsel":["Tang King Kai (Tang & Partners) for the plaintiff","Ng Wen Wen (Grace Law LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-06-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>WXG v WXH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WXG <em>v</em> WXH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4868 of 2022 (Summons No 1012 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 May 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Tang King Kai (Tang &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff; Ng Wen Wen (Grace Law LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WXG — WXH </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Sufficiency of Answer</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 May 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties registered their marriage on 19 March 1998. A year later, they welcomed their son into the family. By all accounts, based on the Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) and the affidavits before me, it was a happy marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This state of affairs, unfortunately, did not last. When the son was 18, he was taken ill. It was not a physical ailment from which he suffered, but one of the mind. It appears that the Wife did the best she could to support her son. Doctors were consulted, and treatment was sought. The Husband, on the other hand, appeared to have difficulty coming to terms with his son’s illness. As to why the Husband reacted in the way he did, we do not know – though the Wife’s Affidavit of Means and Assets (“AOM”) provides some clues. The Husband has, in any case, made no mention of this in any of his affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       What we do know is that the relationship between Husband and Wife deteriorated to the point that the Husband filed for divorce on 19 October 2022. Interim judgment was obtained on 16 August 2023. Mediation was attempted but bore no fruit. This set parties on course for an ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The next stage in this process was the exchange of parties’ affidavits of assets and means (“AOMs”). The Wife, being dissatisfied with the extent of the Husband’s disclosure, filed an application for discovery and interrogatories in SUM 1012 of 2024 (“SUM 1012”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I heard oral submissions from parties on 20 May 2024. I now give my decision in respect of SUM 1012.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Request for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was the interrogatory that had been posed by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff is to account for the sum of $55,224.53 parties had in a fixed deposit account number x-x-xxx-xxxxxxxxx-4-702 under Hong Leong Bank. This sum was withdrawn by the Plaintiff upon the maturity of the fixed deposit in July 2022, without the Defendant’s knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Tang, argued that the Husband had already answered this question. This was the Husband’s reply to the interrogatory in his Notice-in-Response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff says that he has no account with Hong Leong Bank and he is not aware of the alleged fixed deposit of $55,224.53 purportedly in his name. This is a frivolous and mischievous allegation and the Defendant is put to strict proof thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In response, counsel for the Wife, Ms Ng, argued that the Husband’s response was inadequate. She said that the Husband was feigning ignorance – given that this was a recent transaction, there was no reason why he could not recall it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In considering the Wife’s application for interrogatories, I am only concerned with the sufficiency, and not the truth of the response provided by the Husband. Although Ms Ng appeared to be contesting the truth of the response, I understood her point to be that the response given by the Husband, which could be characterised as a general denial, to be an insufficient answer to the interrogatory posed. Ms Ng confirmed that this was indeed her argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As to whether the Husband’s response was sufficient, the case of <em>Earp v Lloyd</em> [1858] 70 ER 24 (“<em>Earp</em>”) is instructive. The court in that case had noted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The rule has always been that, where there is a specific averment, an interrogatory founded upon that specific averment must be specifically answered; <b>a general denial is not a sufficient answer to a specific averment</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>Earp</em>, the averment was that land was to be conveyed to one Smith. The interrogatory was whether “such land was not conveyed to one Smith, or to some and what person or persons”. The answer which the plaintiff had given was that he “could not set forth whether the property was conveyed to Smith or to any person or persons”. The court ruled that this answer was insufficient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the present case, the Wife has asked the Husband to account for the sum of $55,224.53 that had been placed in a fixed deposit with Hin Leong bank. She had stated, specifically, in her AOM, that the Husband had withdrawn this sum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> She had even referred him to a statement of said fixed deposit from Hin Leong bank. That statement showed that the fixed deposit had also been placed in the Husband’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I find that the Husband’s response is indeed insufficient. The Wife had asked him a question that was founded on a specific averment in her AOM. Given this, it does not suffice for the Husband to simply respond with a bare denial that he had no account with Hin Leong, and that he is not aware of a fixed deposit for $55,224.53 that was allegedly in his name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore order that the Husband answer this interrogatory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Request for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I come now to the Wife’s request for Discovery. There were 12 items on the list. They could be categorised into the following two groups:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Full monthly statements of accounts in respect of each of the six bank accounts in the Husband’s name (Items 1 – 6) for the period 1 January 2021 – 31 January 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Documents evidencing account closure in respect of each of the same six bank accounts in the Husband’s name (Items 7 – 12).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Ms Ng argued, both at the hearing and in her well-written skeletal submissions, that disclosure of these documents were relevant and necessary for the hearing of the ancillary matter because it appeared that the Husband had taken steps to dissipate assets that should rightfully belong to the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This is, according to Ms Ng, evident from the fact that all six accounts were closed over the span of a few months, in the time leading up to and shortly after the entering of the interim judgment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Wife would need these documents to determine exactly when these six accounts had been closed, and whether the Husband had indeed dissipated the money in these accounts, and if so, where the money had been transferred to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In response, Mr Tang argued that the Husband had already made voluntary disclosure of the account balances in these six accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In any event, the Husband had already stated, in his Notice in Response to the Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Request for Discovery (“NIR”), that he did not have, in his possession, the final statement in respect of these six accounts as he did not expect the Wife to ask for these documents, and in any case, the account had already been closed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I understood Mr Tang to be making the point that I could not make an order for the discovery of the bank account statements because those documents did not exist. It is true that “a prerequisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some [<em>prima facie</em>] evidence that the document requested is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power”: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64] citing <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I am satisfied that there was such <em>prima facie</em> evidence. After all, it is not disputed that these six accounts were in the Husband’s name. And if the Husband had these accounts, it also stands to reason that the banks would have provided these statements. There was, in any event, nothing in the Husband’s reply affidavit, or the NIR, denying the existence of these documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Insofar as the principles relating to discovery are concerned, it is trite law that an order for discovery should only be made if the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the disposal of the ancillary matters: <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> at [10] citing Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     There can, in my judgment, be no quarrel that the account statements (<em>ie</em>, Items 1 – 6) which the Wife sought were indeed relevant and necessary to the disposal of ancillary matters. If the Husband had withdrawn or transferred money from any of those six accounts, it would be reflected in the account statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, I did not find that the request for the documents evidencing account closure was relevant or necessary. What the Wife was really after were the account statements – she wanted to know what had happened to the money in those six accounts. If the Husband’s position was that he had closed the accounts, and therefore could not provide the account statements, that was for him to show by way of documentary evidence that the accounts had indeed been closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will therefore allow the request in respect of Items 1 – 6, and disallow the request in respect of Items 7 – 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     It is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in S/N 1 – 6 of Schedule 1 annexed to SUM 1012/2024, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatory as set out in Schedule 2 annexed to SUM 1012/2024 on affidavit, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavits by 18 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Parties are to file and serve their costs submissions by way of letter by 12 June. The submissions should be no longer than 5 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It remains for me to thank both Mr Tang and Ms Ng for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s AOM at para 26(h).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Skeletal Submissions in support of SUM 1012 at paras 18 – 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 1012 at pp 69 – 72.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit in response to SUM 1012, Exhibit A.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 1012 at pp 69 – 72.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Discovery","Civil Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2024-05-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 5944 of 2022 (Summons No 975 and 1283 of 2024)","title":"WXI v WXJ","citation":"[2024] SGFC 31","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31581-SSP.xml","counsel":["Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

In the same year, they made their way to Singapore. During this time, they welcomed a son and a daughter into their family. Sometime in 2010, parties returned to India. Five years later, the Wife returned to Singapore. She did so to help the family maintain the matrimonial home – a HDB flat which they had bought early in their marriage. The son also returned to Singapore sometime in October 2022 to enlist for National Service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       As to how the relationship between Husband and Wife broke down, details are provided in the Statement of Particulars. In essence, the Wife felt that the Husband had not supported her in their marriage. This caused her an undue amount of stress as she had to look after the family finances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On the emotional front, the Wife felt that the Husband was indifferent to her emotional needs and that she was living in an “empty shell marriage”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Unable to tolerate this state of affairs any longer, the Wife filed for divorce on 22 December 2022. Interim judgment was obtained on 31 August 2023. Parties subsequently set course for a hearing of the ancillary matters. In preparation for that hearing, they exchanged their respective affidavits of assets and means. Evidently, both were dissatisfied with the extent of disclosure that had been provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       This thus spawned the two applications that came before me. SUM 975/2024 (“SUM 975”) was the Wife’s application for discovery. SUM 1283/2024 (“SUM 1283”) was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. I heard both applications on 17 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       This is my decision in respect of SUM 975 and SUM 1283.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery (“SUM 975”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the hearing, counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha, confirmed that she would not be proceeding in respect of Items 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 of Annex A to SUM 975. I will therefore deal with the rest of the items on that list. In doing so, I bear in mind the guiding principle that discovery should only be ordered if the document sought is relevant, and necessary for the disposal of the ancillary matters or for saving costs: <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a> (“<em>UJN</em>”) at [10]; Rules 63 – 77 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I will first deal with the Wife’s request for various statements of the Husband’s CPF account. These were the relevant items:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 2: the Husband’s CPF transactions and contribution statements for 2020 – 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3: the Husband’s current CPF investment statement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Item 5: the Husband’s CPF account statement as of November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Ms Seetha says that these statements are relevant and necessary towards determining the matrimonial pool of assets. The CPF statements would also enable the Wife to ascertain the Husband’s income. The Husband’s response was that he had produced these statements in his response to the Wife’s request for discovery.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband also stated that he was, in any case, ready to provide these documents should the court order it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I will allow the request in respect of Items 2, 3 and 5. I find that the CPF statements are indeed relevant and necessary for the hearing of ancillary matters. It would shed light on the Husband’s income, and also be useful for ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Item 4 was a request for the Husband to produce statements for his bank accounts with DBS and City Union Bank for the period December 2022 to November 2023. Ms Seetha argued that these documents were relevant and necessary for the ancillary hearing as they would shed light on the Husband’s assets. In response, the Husband stated that he was willing to provide the documents to the court, but he did not want the Wife to have sight of it. He explained that there were transactions in those documents that could affect his reputation. He did not want the children to be affected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I will allow the Wife’s request in respect of Item 4. The documents sought were clearly relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters. These documents would shed light on the financial status of the Husband in the period following the filing of the divorce. That the Husband did not want the Wife having sight of the bank statements is not a basis for refusing disclosure. I would, however, add that while I have ordered that the Husband disclose these documents, they are only to be used for the purposes of the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Item 9 was a request for the Husband to produce documents on the alleged claims of two creditors, one Mr J and Swift Credit. Ms Seetha explained that they were requesting for these documents as the copies which the Husband had provided were illegible. These documents, according to Ms Seetha, were relevant for the hearing of ancillary matters in that they would establish the Husband’s direct and indirect contributions and show whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband’s response was that because the documents he had provided was in the Wife’s handwriting, she should be able to decipher what had been written.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I disallow this request. As I had pointed out to Ms Seetha during the hearing – if the Husband sought to rely on these documents to establish his financial contributions, he bore the onus of proving it and producing the necessary documentary evidence to that effect. In any event, I was not satisfied as to the relevancy of these documents – it would only show the extent of the obligations as between the Husband and his creditors, but it would not show how the proceeds from these loans had been used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Item 12 related to mortgage loan statements from HDFC Bank India (“HDFC”) for the matrimonial property in India from 2017 – 2023. Ms Seetha explained that these documents were necessary to confirm that the Husband had indeed contributed to the matrimonial property in India. In response, the Husband argued that because the Wife was also a party to the mortgage that had been taken out, she too was in a position to ask for these documents. The Husband further stated that the bank would only provide a yearly statement, and that he had already provided this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I will disallow the request in respect of Item 12. Similarly, if it is the Husband’s case that he had contributed to the acquisition of the matrimonial property in India by way of repaying the mortgage, then it was for him to put forward those documents in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s Application for Discovery and Interrogatories (“SUM 1283”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I turn now to the Husband’s request for discovery and interrogatories. During the hearing, the Husband confirmed that he would not be proceeding in respect of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Discovery: Items 1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, and 22.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Interrogatories: Items 1, and 5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>I will deal with the rest of the items that had been proceeded with, beginning with the Husband’s request for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Interrogatories</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I note, at the outset, that the Husband had failed to, in SUM 1283, include the relevant prayers. He had only annexed the list of interrogatories that he sought to SUM 1283. Ms Seetha, however, raised no objections on this ground. She dealt with the Husband’s application on its substance. She had also put in written submissions to respond to the Husband’s request for interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It must be noted that the Husband is self-represented. While Rule 69(6) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 stipulates that an application for interrogatories for interrogatories to be answered must be made by way of summons in the relevant Form, I do not think the Husband should, in this case, be penalised for his non-compliance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I will therefore deal with his application for interrogatories as had been argued before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In deciding whether interrogatories should be ordered, I must look at the sufficiency of the Wife’s answers. In other words, I must be satisfied that she has answered the interrogatories that the Husband had posed to her. The truth of the answers is not ascertained at this stage of proceedings. If the Husband says that the Wife’s answers are not true, that is for him to raise at the ancillary hearing. I also bear in mind the principle that the interrogatory posed must be relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters (see <em>UJN</em> at [10] and [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I start with Item 2. The Husband had asked the Wife to provide a breakdown of her monthly loan repayments. This was the Wife’s response:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“This is just a rough figure. The Plaintiff has to pay to five different credit facilities. The amount varies with each bank every month”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     This is not a sufficient answer. The question specifically asks for a breakdown of the Wife’s monthly loan repayments. The Wife has side-stepped the question. She has not given a breakdown of her monthly loan repayments. She has only disclosed her obligation to pay five different credit facilities every month without setting out the details of the amounts she is paying. I will therefore allow the request in respect of Item 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The interrogatory posed in Item 3 asked the Wife to state her monthly income from the time parties were married in 2001 to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I disallow the request in respect of this item. The Wife has, in her response, stated her monthly salary from the time parties were married to date.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Her answer to the interrogatory posed is sufficient. It appeared to me that the Husband was disputing the sums that the Wife had declared – his point was that the Wife had, in her response, under-declared her monthly salary. However, as I have already mentioned, if there is any dispute as to the truth of the answer to an interrogatory, that is to be raised at the hearing of ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Item 4 required the Wife to confirm that she had the Husband’s ATM card for his POSB account in her possession, and that she had full access to the said account from the period between June 2017 to August 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband explained that he had deposited money into his POSB account whilst he was working in India. However, the money had, according to his bank statements, been withdrawn from an ATM near to the matrimonial home. In short – he suspected the Wife of taking withdrawing the money which he had deposited into this account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I will allow the request in respect of Item 4. I am satisfied that it is relevant and necessary for the disposal of ancillary matters given the Husband’s allegation that the Wife had taken the money, which were the fruits of his labour. Further, the Wife’s response is also insufficient. She had given a bare denial that she does not have possession of the Husband’s ATM card. But there is another part to the interrogatory – that is whether she had full access to the said account from June 2017 to August 2019. The Wife has not given an answer to this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I turn now to the Husband’s request for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Item 2 was for documents evidencing cash payments made by the Wife towards the HDB flat from 1 August 2004 – 2010. The Husband argued that proof of the bank statements was necessary to confirm that the Wife had indeed made the cash payments which she claimed she had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In response, Ms Seetha said that the Wife had already disclosed the documents which the Husband sought in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I disallow the request. In considering an application for discovery, I must also consider the prejudice that is likely to be caused to the other party if an order to produce documents is made: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> (“<em>VTQ</em>”) at [26(a)]. The documents sought went back to transactions that had taken place from 2004 to 2010. The Wife would face considerable difficulties in attempting to obtain these documents. In any event, the point of discovery is to ensure that the judge has all the relevant material for the disposal of the case. It is not meant to allow parties disprove assertions made by the other party by demanding documentary evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I turn now to Item 5. The Wife had claimed that she had borrowed money from debtors to pay for the matrimonial home in India as well as legal fees for the divorce. According to the Wife, her sister had helped her repay this sum. She thus took out a loan from Standard Chartered Bank to repay her sister.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Item 5 was a request for documents supporting the Wife’s claim concerning this loan. The Husband essentially wanted documents proving that the Wife had taken out a loan with Standard Chartered, and that that sum of money had indeed been used to repay her sister. He said that it was necessary for the Wife to provide proof that the money had indeed been transferred to her sister’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Again, Ms Seetha said that the documents the Husband was asking for had already been disclosed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Having had sight of the documents which Ms Seetha had referred me to, I note that the manner in which they had been presented was less than ideal. There were some 20 pages worth of what appeared to be receipts from HDFC bank disclosed in the Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM. Some of these receipts, the contents of which were handwritten, were barely legible. It did not help that the scanned images were grainy, and in some cases, blurred. As to what these receipts were, and what they were meant to show – the brief explanation provided in the Wife’s NIR was inadequate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It did not help that there was no explanation accompanying these receipts to provide some context, nor was there any pinpoint reference to these exhibits in the Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As for the Husband’s request in respect of Item 5, that is disallowed. It is for the Wife to adduce evidence to support her assertion that she had borrowed money from her sister and that those sums were applied to the matrimonial home in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I come now to Item 6. These were documents evidencing that the sum of $9303.15 incurred on the HSBC credit card had been used for family expenses. The Husband explained that the statements were necessary because the Wife had stated, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had spent the sum of $9303.15 on her credit card.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Ms Seetha said that enquiries had been made with the bank and the Wife was informed that the statements which the Husband sought could not be obtained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I will allow the request in respect of Item 6. Although the request could have been better framed, I am satisfied that these documents are indeed relevant to the disposal of ancillary matters in that they would shed light on the family’s expenditure as well as the Wife’s financial contributions. The Wife should, if she is indeed unable to obtain these statements from HSBC, exhibit documents (<em>ie</em>, a letter from the bank), evidencing the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Next on the list was Item 8. The Wife had taken out a loan with Maybank for the sum of $5000 to redeem her mother’s jewellery that had been pawned to support family expenses. Item 8 was the Husband’s request for documents to prove that such a loan had been taken out with Maybank and that the jewellery had indeed been redeemed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband said disclosure was necessary because the Wife alleged that she had transferred money to her sister’s account, but there was no proof of such transfers. Ms Seetha, on the other hand, urged me not to allow the Husband’s request as the Wife had already disclosed the relevant documents in her reply affidavit to this summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I disallow the request in respect of Item 8. Whether the Wife could prove that she had taken a loan from her sister was a matter for submissions at the ancillary hearing. It was not a basis on which discovery could be pursued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     That said, I do note that the Wife has disclosed some documents. The first, was a POSB bank statement. The second, was a deposit slip.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> While there is an explanation as to what the POSB statement was supposed to reflect, no such explanation was provided for the deposit slip. Apart from these documents, reference was also made to the 20 pages worth of receipts that I have described above (at [32]). As I have already mentioned (above at [32]), if the Wife intends to rely on these documents, they must be neatly organised, and where necessary, an explanation to provide context should be included.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Items 9 and 10 related to the Husband’s request for documentary evidence to support the Wife’s claim that she had received the sum of $25,000 and $5000 from pawning her wedding jewellery, and that these sums had been used for the downpayment of the HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s contention is that based on the gold prices then, it was simply inconceivable that the Wife had been able to receive those sums of cash. He therefore needed the documents to establish that the Wife had indeed obtained this sum of money which allegedly went towards the downpayment of the HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I disallow the request for Items 9 and 10. The jewellery had been pawned more than 20 years ago. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to track down, and obtain such documents given the time that had passed. The extent of discovery that can be ordered is necessarily circumscribed by the practicality of obtaining the documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Item 11 was the Husband’s request for documentary evidence that the Wife had repaid the sum of $19,806.85 towards renovation of the HDB flat. The Husband explained that these documents were necessary to prove that the Wife had indeed paid off this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I disallow the request in respect of Item 11. The Wife had already disclosed the relevant documents. This document which the Wife produced was a letter from Tan Kok Quan partnership, on behalf of the creditor bank, which was addressed to the Wife. Its contents are clear. It shows how the renovation loan had been paid off.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Item 12 was a request for documentary evidence that the Wife had taken a loan of $20,000 from her sister. The Husband explained that there was no proof of this loan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I disallow the request in respect of Item 12. The Wife had stated, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she borrowed money from her sister to pay off the India housing loan of $20,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Again, it is for her to provide the necessary evidence in support of her assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I will deal with the next two items together. Item 16 was a request for documents to support the Wife’s claim that she had given the Husband $7000 towards the discharge of his bankruptcy. Item 17 was a request for documents to support the Wife’s claim that the alleged sum of $7000 which she had given to the Husband was used by him to pay off the mortgage on the Indian matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     These two items are related because the Wife had stated, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had borrowed $7000 from the Husband’s friend. She had tried to use this amount in an attempt to discharge the Husband from bankruptcy. The Public Trustee refused to accept this payment, and refunded the money. The Wife subsequently channelled this sum to the Husband who used it for the Indian matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Husband has asked for these documents because he says he cannot accept the Wife’s version of events – he wants her to prove her assertions by producing documentary evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While it is true that he or she who asserts must prove their case, that is a matter to be properly pursued at the ancillary hearing. The Husband had been reminded of this at a case conference prior to this hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I therefore disallow the request in respect of Items 16 and 17.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The next few items can also be dealt with together:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 19 was a request for documents to show that the Wife had paid around $20,000 towards the family’s expenses. The Wife had stated, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had spent this money on the family’s trip to Singapore in 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 21 was a request for documents showing that the Wife had paid the maid levy since 2007.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Item 23 was a request for documents evidencing the Wife’s sale of her land in India and the sums received from this sale, as well as documents showing that these sale proceeds had indeed been used to redeem the Wife’s bridal jewellery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The common thread binding these three items is that whether the Wife had put forth evidence in support of her claims is, once again, a matter for submissions at the ancillary hearing. The discovery process is not a forum for one to challenge assertions or claims made by the other side by demanding that they provide documentary evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I therefore disallow the request in respect of Item 19, 21, and 23.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I come now to the final item on the list: Item 24. This was a request for bank account statements for the POSB account ending 8410 for the period June 2017 to August 2019. It mirrored the Husband’s request for interrogatories (see [23] – [25] above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I will allow the request. I am satisfied as to the relevancy and necessity of the document sought. The nub of the Husband’s contention was that the Wife had deposited the money withdrawn from his POSB account into her own account (ending 8410). These bank statements were therefore relevant and necessary to allow the Husband to trace the sums that had been withdrawn from his account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I make the following orders in respect of SUM 975:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in S/N 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Schedule A annexed to this summons, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As for SUM 1283, I make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in S/N 6 and 24 of the Request for Discovery annexed to this summons, whether the same is in her possession, custody or power, and if not then in her possession, custody or power, when she parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in her possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in her custody, power or possession, she is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife shall answer the interrogatories as set out in Item 2, and 4 of the Request for Interrogatories annexed to this summons on affidavit, to the best of her knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In addition to the above orders, I also order that compliance affidavits are to be filed by 21 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     As for costs, the Husband argued that he should be entitled to costs in respect of SUM 975 as well as SUM 1283. Ms Seetha on the other hand, said that she would leave the matter of costs to the court but highlighted the Husband’s conduct, in particular, the manner in which he had framed his requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     These are the applicable principles relating to costs. They can be found in Rules 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014. Costs are in the discretion of the court. If the court sees fit to order costs, the starting point is that costs follow the event. The court, however, can depart from this starting point, taking into account, amongst other things, the conduct of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Apart from Rules 852 and 854, Rule 870 of the FJR 2014 is also relevant because the Husband is a self-represented person. Rule 870 provides that the court has the discretion to allow costs for a self-represented person that would be reasonable compensation for the time expended by him, together with all the expenses reasonably incurred: see <em>VTQ</em> at [81].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In respect of SUM 975, the Wife has substantially succeeded in her application. I also took into account the fact that the matter was not particularly complex. Costs are therefore fixed at $400 (all-in), to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     As for SUM 1283, the Husband did not substantially succeed in his application. The matter was not particularly complex though I note that the Husband had sought both disclosure in respect of a number of documents as well as interrogatories. In the circumstances, costs are fixed at $450 (all-in) to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I conclude with one observation. The whole point of the discovery process is to ensure that all the necessary evidence relevant to the disposal of ancillary matters is before the judge hearing the matter: <em>VTQ</em> at [79]. The corollary of this is that these documents should be neatly organised and presented. If there are references to the documents in the affidavits or in submissions, pinpoint references should, as far as possible, be provided. If scanned copies of documents are provided, the onus is on parties to ensure that the images are clear, and that any handwriting is legible (see Practice Directions 110 and 112 of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions). If the documents are in a foreign language, a certified translation must be provided. Parties do themselves no favours if they do not, at least, make an attempt to properly organise and present the documents on which they are seeking to rely.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1) at para 1(c).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1) at para 1(h).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit in support of SUM 975 at p 30.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s affidavit in reply to SUM 1283 at pp 81 – 82.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 14(a).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Reply affidavit to SUM 1283 at pp 28 – 29;

This includes on the one hand, the need for stability in carrying out orders and establishing the post-divorce routine for the child over a reasonable period of time, and on the other, the need to be responsive to new developments. As to the former consideration, we recognise that it is not desirable for the parties and their children to be “in limbo”, where constant applications for variation result in uncertainty for the children and keeps the family in the “litigation box” even before there has been sufficient time for the new arrangements to be carried out or for routines to be set up. As to the latter consideration, we are cognisant that the parent-child relationship is dynamic, especially since children have new needs and preferences as they grow older. Thus, the court must also ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances facing the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17    The upshot of these competing interests is that while the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child, this should <em>not</em> encourage parties to pursue a variation of orders at the earliest opportunity. Instead, the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements”: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<em>TAU</em>”) (at [10]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As the present case involves the variation of a consent order, the observations of Choo Han Teck J in <em>VWQ v VWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a> (“<em>VWG v VWR</em>”) (at [9]) also bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the court has broad powers under ss 73, 119 and 129 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) to vary agreements on issues of custody and maintenance, such powers should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances (<em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a>). Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties, and the courts would be slow to re-write their contract. Privately settled terms negotiated by the parties, especially in family matters are to be encouraged. As such, they should be respected, and not lightly changed. Otherwise, one party may lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to call in aid the provisions in the Women’s Charter to vary their agreement (<em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a>) when they feel that the bargain was not to their liking subsequently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Although the Mother’s position is that there is no material change in circumstances as the Father was aware of her struggle with alcohol even before the consent order was made, it is clear from a review of the evidence and the CER that the children are distressed and affected by her current condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     While the court would be slow to re-write a consent order agreed upon by parties, there are concerns affecting the wellbeing of the children that need to be addressed. As noted above, the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child. The court must ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances facing the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In the present case, both parents have deficits due to their alcoholism. As alcoholism is a life-long mental health concern that the parents will require addiction treatment and ongoing aftercare, the reality is that either parent could experience relapses, especially given the heightened stressors due to the variation applications. The difference is that the Father appears to have coped better. He is able to sustain employment and function daily. He is open about his challenges and has demonstrated a willingness to acknowledge his own failings and work on them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In contrast, the Mother, unfortunately, does not seem to be coping well. She is unable to sustain employment and has stopped work since September 2021 on the advice of her doctors and therapists to focus on recovery from her mental health conditions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> The fragility of her mental state is worrying, as may be gathered from her insistence that she would be “completely devasted” if the Father is granted sole care and control of the children. She appears to lack insight and attunement to the children’s struggles and tends to focus on the Father’s deficits instead of taking accountability for her own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     While I empathise with both parents in the challenges they face, it is important for the parents to recognise that the children’s exposure to their alcoholism is a cause for concern as there is an impact on their current coping and future self.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I share some insights from the social science perspective. As noted in the CER, children in general need some structure and predictability. Their emotional and psychological wellbeing will benefit from a consistency of care for them to develop secure attachments. Unfortunately, when living with a parent with alcohol addiction, children tend to function in a survival mode as they have to tread carefully around the parent to avoid triggering the parent and to maintain peace. Additionally, children may become confused and potentially blame themselves when the alcoholic parent denies the addiction problem. Due to these experiences, children tend to be more rigid and inflexible, have anxiety, self-critical, have perfectionist traits, and hold back emotionally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In the present case, there is an even greater need for the parents to be empathetic to the children’s struggles, given that both parents suffer from alcohol dependency issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In addition, the ongoing litigation has harmful effects on the children. In this regard, the following caution of Debbie Ong JAD in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27460-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 9</a> (at [47]) bears reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Litigation has harmful effects on the child – materially, because the family loses in incurring litigation expenses, and psychologically, because conflict affects the whole family in ways not easily visible …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The parents need to rise above their own challenges and mitigate the stressors affecting the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As noted above, the Father presents as a functioning alcoholic. He is able to manage and attend to the children’s needs and has been proactive in engaging the school about the children’s coping and progress. The children cope better with the Father due to his mannerisms towards them and the stability that he offers. Although the Mother is the care and control parent, the children appear to rely on the Father for emotional support and safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As the Father is a stabilising presence in the lives of the children, he can provide support to the children by taking on greater responsibility in their care. Indeed, that is what the Father hopes to do. That said, I am mindful that a reversal of care and control would be too drastic and could deal a heavy blow to the Mother given her fragility. The children are worried about the Mother’s emotional and physical wellbeing and want her to get better. They care for the Mother and love her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my view, there is room for a more compassionate approach to be adopted – one that allows for the children’s needs to be addressed without discouraging the Mother and affecting her recovery. For this reason, I find that a shared care arrangement is preferrable to a reversal of care and control. Under a shared care arrangement, the Mother can take comfort in the fact that the care of the children is not “taken away” from her as she had feared. On the contrary, the children will benefit from the care given by both parents playing equal and complementary roles in their lives. The shared care arrangement is also consistent with the Mother’s commitment to raise the children to the best of her ability with the Father. The Mother will also have more time to focus on her recovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For these reasons, I ordered that the parents shall have joint custody and shared care and control of the children on the terms set out in [7] above. Additionally, as the parents and children can benefit from the mental health and therapeutic services provided by a mental health trained therapist under the POTS (Panel of Therapeutic Specialists) Programme, the parents were encouraged to consider entering into a consent order for this purpose so that a referral could be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Variation of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I turn now to the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a>, the Court of Appeal noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    In relation to variation of maintenance for children, the relevant provisions are in ss 72 and 73:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Rescission and variation of order</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, his wife or child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Power of court to vary agreement for maintenance of child</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <b>73</b>.    The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child… notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the parties did not cite these provisions in their respective cases or submissions before us, we thought that we should make clear the basis for varying the maintenance of the Children if that is what we are minded to do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    Section 73 provides that any agreement relating to maintenance may be varied where the court is “satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”. The parties did not address us at all on this requirement under s 73. But in our judgment, the provision is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances of the parents as <em>a</em> basis for varying the maintenance for the child. Whether or not this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is of course a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of each case. In the present appeals before us, the parties addressed us solely on whether there were material changes in the circumstances. Nonetheless we also considered the provisions of s 73.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Sections 72 and 73, which fall under Part 8 of the Charter, are applicable to a maintenance order made under s 127(1) of the Charter by virtue of s 127(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As noted in <em>VWG v VWR</em>, the court’s powers to vary agreements on maintenance should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father says that at the time of the consent order, the parties agreed to share the children’s reasonable monthly expenses equally. As the children’s monthly expenses amount to about S$16,000, they agreed that the Father shall pay the Mother half of this sum a month for the children’s maintenance. Although he initially made an offer to pay maintenance of S$7,000 for the children, they eventually agreed to the sum of S$8,500, and this is reflected in the consent order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Mother says that the children’s school fees have been excluded from the children’s reasonable expenses since the consent order was made as her parents have been paying for that expense.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     This is disputed by the Father as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I am fully aware that the Plaintiff’s parents have been paying the children’s school fees directly at the Plaintiff’s instructions which is on all accounts, the Plaintiff’s prerogative, but this does not mean that I have not been contributing to the children’s school fees every month. I state that the existing maintenance sum of $8,500 includes provision for the children’s school fees and repeat the above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Mother says that her parents knew that the maintenance provided by the Father would be inadequate to maintain the standard of living which the children and the Mother were accustomed to and said that they would help pay for the children’s school fees if they live with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> However, the Mother did not produce any affidavit from her parents to support her claim nor did she produce any other corroborative evidence to show that the school fees were excluded from the computation of the children’s monthly expenses at the time of the consent order. In the circumstances, I found it difficult to accept the Mother’s bare assertion. In my judgment, it is more likely that the existing maintenance sum of $8,500 includes provision for the children’s school fees as stated by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father says that the children’s monthly expenses and needs have not changed significantly since the IJ, and there should not be any revision to the quantum payable for their monthly maintenance moving forward.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> He disagrees with the Mother’s assertion that the monthly expenses of the children have increased to the tune of S$21,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> The Father says that if he were to have care and control of the children, the Mother shall pay the children’s monthly maintenance amount of $8,500 to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Since the Father’s prayer for reversal of care and control is not granted, it follows that the Father’s prayer for the Mother to pay reasonable maintenance in the sum of $8,500 per month for the children must likewise be refused. While a downward adjustment to the quantum of the maintenance payable by the Father would have been warranted to take into account the fact that the children will now spend more time with the Father under the shared care arrangement, I note that the Mother has been unemployed since September 2021 on medical ground.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Balancing all factors, I found that it would be preferrable for the <em>status quo</em> to remain for now. Accordingly, I made no adjustment to the existing maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Turning now to the Mother’s cross-application to increase the maintenance for the children, the Mother’s case is that at the time the consent order was made, she was working at Employer B and her gross monthly income in 2021 was $6,836.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> In September 2021, she resigned from her job<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> at the advice of her doctor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> and has not gone back to the workforce since then.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The Mother says that she no longer has an income or earning capacity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> This is a material change in circumstances which warrants the Mother asking for the Father to pay the bulk of the children’s expenses amounting to S$21,000 per month. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Father says that while the Mother claims in her affidavit that she is unemployed and insinuates that she is unable to obtain employment due to her depression and alcohol abuse, she in fact has represented that she has always been employed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> The Father says that the Mother has failed to account for regular deposits to her DBS Multi Currency Autosave Account between the period February 2023 to May 2023, which suggests that she has undeclared sources of income.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> The Father alleges that the Mother is seeking to hide her actual income earnings and the full extent of her wealth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Father says further that the Mother’s doctor’s memo does not state that she is prevented from or unable to obtain other employment from her previous work at Employer B. Since being out of job in September 2021, the Mother has not shown any effort to obtain gainful employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments. For instance, a party who earns no income but has substantial savings or had received substantial inheritance would well be able to afford to bear a higher burden of the maintenance obligation, if reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The court should also have regard to the assets received by parties after the division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As the Mother is seeking to vary the maintenance order, the burden of proving the existence of a material change in circumstances rests with her: see <em>AXM v AXO</em> [2014] 2 SLR 805 (at [31]). The Mother says that she no longer has an income or earning capacity, though this is disputed by the Father. However, even taking her case at its highest, I found that she has not discharged the burden of proof. As noted above, the financial capacity of a party is not rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. The court is required to consider the party’s property and other financial resources. A party who earns no income may well have property and other financial resources that could meet his or her maintenance obligation. As the Mother has not provided any evidence of her property or other financial resources, there is no basis for the court to form an accurate assessment of her financial capacity that would warrant a variation. Accordingly, I made no order on her cross-application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As neither party has succeeded fully and having regard also to the need to reduce acrimony, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s Written Submissions dated 7 November

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties in these proceedings were formerly husband and wife. In these Grounds, I shall refer to the parties as the Mother, who is the Plaintiff, and Father, who is the Defendant. The Mother and Father (“the Parties”) have one child, A, who was born in 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Parties were married in 2014. The Mother commenced divorce proceedings in 2018 and the Interim Judgment was granted that year. I made orders in respect of the ancillary matters on 25 March 2019 (“the Ancillary Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>”), which granted, among others, care and control of A to the Mother and reasonable access to the Father. Both Parties, being dissatisfied with parts of my decision, filed cross-appeals<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. Both appeals were dismissed in October 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and previous applications</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the Final Judgment was issued, the Father filed two applications to vary the Ancillary Order. The first application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, filed in December 2019, sought a variation of the access orders in the Ancillary Order (“the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Application”). The 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Application essentially sought to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Start Monday access one hour earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Extend overnight access to 2 nights per week (instead of 1 night per week).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Include Deepavali in the reckoning of Public Holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Allow Parties to take A overseas irrespective of whether there were school closures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Include orders for birthday access, being present at A’s medical check-ups and the Parties’ parents assisting with A’s handovers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I dismissed the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Application but made the following orders in addition to, and to be read with, the Ancillary Order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Each parent shall update the other on A’s medical issues within two days of receiving such update (or within two days of the doctor’s visit, as the case may be).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parent who does not have care of A on her birthday will have her birthday dinner with her from 6:30 p.m. – 8:30 p.m. on A’s birthday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The parents of the Father and Mother shall be at liberty to assist the Father and Mother with access handovers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The orders in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Application were granted on 1 June 2020 (“the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Order”). There was no appeal filed against the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second variation application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> was filed in May 2021, less than a year after the 1<sup>st</sup> Variation Order was granted (“the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application”). The 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application sought to expand overnight access from one to three nights and reduce maintenance for A. I dismissed the Father’s application to reduce A’s maintenance but increased overnight access from one night to two nights, ordering that the Father have access to A every Thursday after school to Saturday 6:30pm each week. I also made some orders on Father’s / Mother’s Day and birthday access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The orders in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application were granted on 21 February 2022 (“the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order”). There was no appeal filed against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Primary One Registration Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Parties could not agree on which primary school A ought to be registered in. I heard and made orders on the Mother’s application in respect of Primary One Registration, granting an order for the Mother to decide on A’s primary school in May 2022. There was no appeal filed against this order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The current application and orders made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The current application to vary the Ancillary Order and 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order was filed by the Father.

He also argued that a material change of circumstances was often the result of a confluence of factors and not simply precipitated by a single event<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father contended that the application was necessary for several reasons, including that A was growing fast and required an adjustment in terms of orders relating to care, control, access etc<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>; it was because of inaction or impasse that the Father sought the assistance of the court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. In support of his position, he raised the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A’s welfare was no longer well served by the current orders<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and she wished to spend more time with the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A was older and in primary school. She had greater demands now and was able to cope with more overnight access and had the capacity to do more activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties could cooperate and were not acrimonious<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He was a committed father, not missing a single access session and aspiring to be a more involved parent. He had taken positive steps to prioritise A and had left his previous job to be able to be increasingly involved in A’s life<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. He now worked at a bank which allowed flexible work hours and work-from-home arrangements resulting in more time and availability for A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Aspects of the Mother’s lifestyle were not favourable to A’s upbringing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> and she had work-related commitments resulting in her spending less time with A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In support of his application for shared care and control, the Father raised the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Shared care and control would allow for better equanimity between parents when dealing with matters relating to A; shared care and control also had a bearing on A as she would be able to witness more co-operation and respect between her parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The party with care and control often uses acrimony to thwart meaningful cooperation and retain sole care and control<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Shared care and control would prevent the Mother from using the excuse that she can dictate matters, just because she had sole care and control<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Under the present care and control orders, the Father’s access was treated as a burden that the Mother had to tolerate. The Mother did not value the Father’s contributions and/or burdens in relation to picking up and dropping off A and acts unilaterally to curtail Father’s access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Besides improving the imbalance, shared care and control would allow the Father more access time with A.

The Father provided this context to the recording:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A has informed me on several occasions that the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff’s mother, and the Plaintiff’s father vape or smoke in front of her while she is at the Plaintiff’s home. A revealed this to me for the first time on <b>1 April 2023</b>. This was brought to my attention during a casual conversation in the car with A. I did not solicit this from A. As there is a recording device in my car, it captured what A had told me and I have transcribed the conversation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_105\" id=\"Ftn_105_1\"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I had great discomfort relying on such evidence; in my view, it was tantamount to overhearing a private conversation between A and her father that was only meant for her father’s ears, and then using the information in these proceedings. I also took this view when dealing with the Father’s recorded conversation with A’s teachers. Again, it was unclear if the teachers were aware that they were being recorded. The Father provided this context to the recording:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Mother’s claim that parties cannot co-operate and there is danger to A’s well-being, my communication with A’s form teachers during the recently concluded mid-term meet the parent session on 26 May 2023 will clearly show that the <b>Mother is making things up</b>. During the session, I had asked A’s form teachers … the following: (a) knowing A’s parents are divorced, is there something to be concerned about in terms of A’s behaviour; (b) to identify whether A is lacking in certain areas; (c) whether A is coping well with school. Her teacher commented with confidence that both me and the Mother are doing a very good job in raising A, we are coparenting well, and there are no areas A is lacking emotionally. She also added A is doing well socially. When I asked if there is any advice on how else I can support A, her teacher mentioned I am doing a good job thus far and just for A to continue reading more books<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_106\" id=\"Ftn_106_1\"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Following my concerns about this approach to obtaining evidence, I was not prepared to give weight to such evidence. In truth, if the Father was concerned about contents of a private conversation he had with A about vaping or smoking, the first port of call should have been to engage the Mother directly over these concerns, not write about it in affidavits that were filed in court. Further, if the Father’s relationship with the Mother was as cordial as he claimed, this would have happened organically. However, the evidence did not show any attempts to engage the Mother in meaningful discussion on his concerns, making it at odds with the Father’s submissions that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Parties could cooperate and were not acrimonious<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_107\" id=\"Ftn_107_1\"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A would be able to witness more co-operation and respect between her parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_108\" id=\"Ftn_108_1\"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Finally, if the Father considered it necessary to obtain evidence from A’s teachers stating their views on A’s progress in school for use in these proceedings, he could have requested a note from the teachers in this regard. The Father has not explained the necessity of recording his conversation with the teachers to achieve this objective. For all these reasons, I was unable to place any weight on the Father’s audio evidence and the corresponding transcripts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control / access orders ought not to be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I was unable to find that the orders on access or care and control should be varied. Firstly, the last round of orders made for this case envisaged A entering Primary One. In arriving at my decision in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application, I was cognizant of the Parties’ parenting journey in the years prior, and what was to follow in the coming year. I was therefore unable to place much weight on A being older and in primary school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_109\" id=\"Ftn_109_1\"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> as a factor constituting material change, as this event was a foreseeable one when granting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Secondly, the Father’s assertions that Parties could cooperate and were not acrimonious<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_110\" id=\"Ftn_110_1\"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>, or that this application was not a result of acrimony<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_111\" id=\"Ftn_111_1\"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>, was not born out in evidence. The affidavits were riddled with allegations by one parent against the other over their speech and conduct, including what was said and/or done in front of A. Each accused the other of behaving unreasonably while maintaining that they themselves had been reasonable. I therefore remained unpersuaded by the Father’s submission that the Mother was using acrimony for self-serving purposes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_112\" id=\"Ftn_112_1\"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Thirdly, I noted the Father’s submission that this application had become necessary because A was growing fast and required an adjustment in terms of care orders<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_113\" id=\"Ftn_113_1\"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span>. However, these were not circumstances under which the court’s powers ought to be invoked. Indeed, if every order needed to be varied simply by virtue of children growing older, there would be an endless stream of applications in every case before the court. This submission was also not consonant with empowering parties to coparent post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Fourthly, I was of the view that there was no need for an order of shared care and control for A to view both parents as equal stakeholders, or to appreciate the fact that both parents played an equal role in her life<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_114\" id=\"Ftn_114_1\"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>. Such views could, and should, be cultivated through functional coparenting and the Parties’ attitudes towards each other; <em>how</em> they gave effect to the court order was important. In this regard, I noted the court’s observations in <em>VJM v VJL</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I had made it clear in <em>TAU v TAT</em> that shared care and control is different from joint custody; the former relates to the child living with both parents, while the latter is about joint decision-making over major decisions affecting the child” (<em>TAU v TAT</em> at [11]). <b>The legal concept that upholds the equal parental responsibility and importance of both parents to the child is “joint custody”. Joint custody requires both parents to recognise and respect each other’s joint and equal role in supporting, guiding and making major decisions for their child. Joint custody assures the child that both her parents continue to be equally present and important in her life.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, the Parties agreed on joint custody from the outset<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_115\" id=\"Ftn_115_1\"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span>. Their joint and equal roles in supporting, guiding and making major decisions for A have therefore never been in doubt, and the Father had not demonstrated the necessity of a shared care and control order to achieve this objective. There was also nothing in evidence to suggest that A’s welfare was no longer well served by the current care orders. In fact, according to the Father’s own evidence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His access from Thursday to Saturday had not disrupted A’s development and there were no adverse reports from the school; on the contrary, A was growing steadily at school<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_116\" id=\"Ftn_116_1\"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A was thriving at every level under the latest arrangements and is growing up nicely<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There were no issues relating to logistics, schoolbooks, clothes, meals, or meetings with the teachers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In the circumstances, the Father had not demonstrated how his proposed changes were in A’s welfare and best interests. I was also unable to find evidence which supported the following submissions by the Father –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His access was treated as a burden that the Mother had to tolerate;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother did not value his contributions in relation to picking up and dropping off A; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Mother acted unilaterally to curtail his access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Next, much fuss was made over Tuesday access, which was designed to be a simple mid-week meet up between father and daughter to share a meal until they met on Thursday for overnight access. Sadly, even this two-hour window caused much spilled ink in the Parties’ affidavits. My view is this: the Father may use the two hours as he sees fit; this is a matter of time management and not a reason to lengthen access, grant overnight access or vary care and control. These are fairly typical mid-week dinner access orders, and the Father had raised nothing in evidence that would justify a variation of these orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Finally, the Father had not demonstrated how his employment changes gave rise to the necessity to vary the orders. In short, the Father’s evidence and submissions did not support his contentions that A’s welfare was no longer well served by the current orders<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span>, and I remained unpersuaded that it was in A’s welfare to vary the orders on care and control and access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Difficulties with the Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I also had several difficulties with the Father’s case. Firstly, the Father relied on several general statements in support of his case. These included the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Shared care and control will prevent the Mother from using the excuse that she can dictate matters, just because she has sole care and control<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_121\" id=\"Ftn_121_1\"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     An imbalance in equal status between parents may reflect onto the child in a negative manner and can possibly have lasting consequences. Arising from this, it is entirely possible for the child not to give any weight to the views of a non-care and control parent at a time of serious discussion, simply because it has been in-built in the child of divorce that the non-care and control parent is inferior to the other who has sole care and control<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_122\" id=\"Ftn_122_1\"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The party with care and control often uses acrimony to thwart meaningful cooperation and retain sole care and control<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_123\" id=\"Ftn_123_1\"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     My view is that challenges over meaningful cooperation and the perceived inferiority of the non-care parent arise only from Parties’ conduct, not the language of a court order. These are not reasons to vary care and control. Secondly, I noted the Father’s submission that he had gone out of his way to be civil and respectful by sending the Mother a condolence message when she lost her family member, describing himself as having engaged in a “selfless action by a concerned individual at the passing of a close relative of his ex-wife”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_124\" id=\"Ftn_124_1\"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span>. While I appreciate the efforts of the Father, my view is that such communication should have occurred in any event – after all, the person who had passed away was his own daughter’s great-grandmother. The fact that he had to “go out of his way” to communicate with the Mother under such circumstances only serves to demonstrate the challenges still present in the Parties’ relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I had the same difficulties with the Father’s description of A’s first day at school as an example of Parties’ cooperation, which he described as “…cooperation exhibited when A was presented on her first day at (her new school). Both Mother and Father were beaming with pride<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_125\" id=\"Ftn_125_1\"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span>”. I was heartened to learn that the Parties enjoyed this special day with A. However, for divorced parents to put their differences aside for a few hours on the first day of their child’s new school, or to agree on video call timings in lieu of access because their child had Covid<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_126\" id=\"Ftn_126_1\"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> - another example of cooperation cited by the Father - represents, in my view, the <em>bare minimum</em> of coparenting; in short, the court would expect nothing less from parents and these are not sufficient reasons, individually or cumulatively, that would constitute a material change in circumstances that would warrant a variation of the care and control order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Thirdly, the language used by the Father in his criticisms of the Mother and her conduct did not inspire confidence in his assertions that Parties were not acrimonious<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_127\" id=\"Ftn_127_1\"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “…the Mother’s arguments … are shrouded in obtuse logic and shallow concerns for A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_128\" id=\"Ftn_128_1\"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “… there are lax rules at the Mother’s home and … order and common sense is waning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_129\" id=\"Ftn_129_1\"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother’s “constant desire in wanting to limit Father’s access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_130\" id=\"Ftn_130_1\"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_d\"></a>(d)     “..risk facing the wrath of Mother during drop off<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_131\" id=\"Ftn_131_1\"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span>…”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_e\"></a>(e)     “… Mother uses the delays in handover to intimidate Father with sanctions and threats of reducing access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_132\" id=\"Ftn_132_1\"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span>…”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_f\"></a>(f)     “..Mother does not know what suitable care arrangements for A are and is just trying to unnecessarily resist Father’s summons. This unfortunately is the sad reality of the parent with sole care and control – the inability to realise that or to understand that parenting is not a zero-sum game<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_133\" id=\"Ftn_133_1\"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_g\"></a>(g)     “…absence of such a holding would embolden Mother to continue pulling wool over the Court’s eyes and to damage A’s upbringing with a misaligned compass<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_134\" id=\"Ftn_134_1\"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_h\"></a>(h)     “She has attempted to trigger Father to respond in anger as part of a deliberate tactic to increase acrimony<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_135\" id=\"Ftn_135_1\"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_i\"></a>(i)     “She has abused her position as care and control parent…<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_136\" id=\"Ftn_136_1\"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_j\"></a>(j)     “…gives me the impression that there is no bond between A and her family in the maternal household, and parties there are just going through a mundane motion in raising a child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_137\" id=\"Ftn_137_1\"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Next, the Father sought to highlight concerns over the Mother’s credibility –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We highlight the inconsistencies within M1A both internally and with reference to her previous affidavits. It gives the Court the impression that she is not sure of her position and is resisting this summons for the sake of resisting it. In the process, she is trying very hard to confuse the court by speaking from both sides of the isle. More importantly, it showcases that Mother has serious credibility issues and confirms the Honourable Court’s findings where DJ Michelle Elias had mentioned in her brief grounds dated 21 Feb 2022, in Father’s previous summons for variation...<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_138\" id=\"Ftn_138_1\"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In support of this position, the Father relied<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_139\" id=\"Ftn_139_1\"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> on the following observations from my earlier decision in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order which increased the Father’s weekly overnight access –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The evidence tells disparate stories; according to the Father, overnight access is extremely successful and meaningful for both A and him. According to the Mother, overnight access (indeed, access in general) is a miserable experience for A who does not want to go.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>I am unable to agree that the evidence as a whole supports the Mother’s contentions.</b> Similar to my findings in March 2019, I continue to find that both parties (and their families) crave and value their time with A. Everyone involved in her care is genuinely invested in promoting her well-being and success. There is nothing in evidence that suggests that either parent is falling short of their responsibilities or duties towards A: both provide a loving and supporting environment for her in their respective homes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I maintain the view that A should have the benefit of overnight access to support the development of a meaningful relationship with her father, save that now, it need not be limited to one night a week. <b>The Father clearly wants to be involved in A’s day-to-day and schooling arrangements, and A should have this benefit as well. There is nothing in evidence to suggest why overnight access should not be increased<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_140\" id=\"Ftn_140_1\"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span>.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis as reproduced in the Father’s written submissions]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Application was filed with separate affidavits, submissions and considerations. Just because I had previously found the Mother’s contentions to be unsupported by evidence <em>on a specific issue</em> had no bearing on her credibility in general, nor did it amount to “serious credibility issues” as argued by the Father. For these additional reasons, I remained unpersuaded that the Ancillary Order and 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order ought to be varied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Prohibitionary orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Mother denied smoking in front of A<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_141\" id=\"Ftn_141_1\"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span>, and I did not consider it appropriate to make orders on this. Whether to smoke, including whether this should be done in front of A, are issues that should correctly be addressed as part of functional coparenting. As for vaping, this is an act governed by other laws applicable in Singapore; it was therefore unnecessary to provide for them in my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Father also sought a specific order prohibiting the Mother from referring to her male counterparts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_142\" id=\"Ftn_142_1\"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> or her relationships with men<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_143\" id=\"Ftn_143_1\"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> as “sugar daddies” when speaking to A. The Mother explained<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_144\" id=\"Ftn_144_1\"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> the context in which this comment was made, namely, that it was a joke referencing the acquisition of luxury cars, inadvertently shared in A’s presence, and intended as light-hearted banter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_145\" id=\"Ftn_145_1\"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span>. I agreed with the Mother that the one-off use of the term did not mean she was an unfit parent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_146\" id=\"Ftn_146_1\"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span>, nor was it a reason to vary care and control or grant an order preventing her from uttering these words again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Finally, the Father sought an order that bound persons who are not party to these proceedings without providing a basis for the court to make such orders. I therefore dismissed all prayers seeking orders of this nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Deepavali access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     While the Father did not appeal against the orders on Deepavali access, I considered it appropriate to make mention of this, as it was part of the orders made in the current application that gave rise to this appeal. Essentially, separate Deepavali access was not previously ordered in the Ancillary Order on the premise that each parent would see A in alternating years arising from the reckoning of Public Holiday access. This arrangement did not develop as anticipated after A started Primary School due to the longer stretch of primary school holidays, as compared with preschool holidays, which resulted in the Father missing out on Deepavali access for two years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_147\" id=\"Ftn_147_1\"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Having been satisfied of the material change in circumstances, and that there remained a dispute over this issue, I made the following Deepavali orders to ensure both parents see A on Deepavali, irrespective of whether it was their ‘turn’ to spend the Deepavali Public Holiday with A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_\"></a>-     <em>For Deepavali, the parent who does not have Public Holiday access with A on Deepavali is to have dinner access with A instead from 6:30pm to 8:30pm.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Video access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I was unable to agree with the Father’s submission that there had been a material change in circumstances warranting the inclusion of a video call access order. I maintained the views expressed in my earlier decision in granting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Variation Order, namely, that I did not consider such orders necessary for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Parties should have the ability to spend uninterrupted blocks of time each week with A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Orders mandating video calls could, in my view, form the basis for further misunderstanding and disagreements between the Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Video calls were not necessary in this case. This was not a case where one parent does not see A for an extended period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Finally, just as with any other type of access, Parties are at liberty to discuss and agree on any additional terms, including video access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Parties’ coparenting relationship requires improvement, including positive affirmation <em>by</em> the parent <em>of</em> the other parent in the roles that they play in A’s life. Efforts should also be made take over ownership over the coparenting process and put differences aside for A’s benefit.

It enabled that action to be disposed of. The public interest there has served its purpose. Should it go further so as to enable the memorandum of April 16, 1969, to be used for this libel action? I think not. The memorandum was obtained by compulsion. Compulsion is an invasion of a private right to keep one’s documents to oneself. The public interest in privacy and confidence demands that this compulsion should not be pressed further than the course of justice requires. The courts should, therefore, not allow the other party — or anyone else —to use the documents for any ulterior or alien purpose. Otherwise the courts themselves would be doing injustice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As noted in <em>Third Eye</em> (at [9]) citing the Court of Appeal (“CA”)’s decision in <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and other appeals and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26578-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 2 SLR 584</a>, situations involving the <em>Riddick</em> principle may broadly be classified under three categories:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>a)     First, it must be determined if a document is produced, or information furnished, out of compulsion. If so, it is covered by the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking. If not, the document or information may be used without the permission of the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>b)     Second, if the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking applies, the question is whether the protected document or information may nonetheless be used without permission due to the nature of the related enforcement proceedings for which it is being used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>c)     Third, if neither of the above is satisfied, the party relying on the protected document or information to commence or sustain related proceedings must seek the court’s permission for the undertaking to be lifted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, the Husband accepts that he is bound by the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking. As such, the Husband filed SUM 3414 praying to be released from the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking for the purpose of being permitted to start the Related HC Proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband clarifies that Prayer 1 of SUM 3414 is not an application to be released from the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking in order to use the Disclosed Documents and Information for a limitless number of undefined extraneous purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The Husband says that Prayer 1 is simply a description of the nature of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking that he was trying to be released from<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> and is specifically limited by Prayer 2, which refers to the related proceedings in the General Division of the High Court to determine the true beneficial ownership of Property A.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband says that he has consistently made clear in his Supporting Affidavit that this is the sole purpose in filing SUM 3414.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given the clarifications provided by the Husband, the central issue before me is whether permission should be granted for the undertaking to be lifted for the sole purpose of enabling the Husband to start the related proceedings in the General Division of the Hight Court to determine the true beneficial ownership of Property A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The law, in this regard, was helpfully summarised in <em>Third Eye</em> as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25    In determining whether permission should be granted, the Court embarks on a balancing exercise to assess “whether the circumstances are such as to justify the lifting of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking” (<em>Lim Suk Ling Priscilla and another v Amber Compounding Pharmacy Pte Ltd and another and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25182-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 912</a> (“<em>Amber Compounding</em>”) at [69]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26    The Court of Appeal in <em>Amber Compounding</em> highlighted five (non- exhaustive) factors which may be raised in favour of lifting the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking (at [71]), of which the only relevant one here is that the EJD Information is to be used to support related foreign civil proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">27    The factors in favour of granting permission are then to be balanced against the interests sought to be protected by the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking, namely the public interest in encouraging full disclosure and the disclosing party’s privacy interests. Factors which militate against the grant of permission include (<em>Amber Compounding</em> at [72]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    injustice or prejudice to the disclosing party – however, where no irremediable prejudice is demonstrated, this factor may be accorded little weight;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    improper purpose for which permission is sought – the court has a general concern to control the collateral use of disclosed documents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    privilege against self-incrimination – which is not engaged in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28    Ultimately, the test is whether “if, in all the circumstances of the case, the interests advanced for the extraneous use of the disclosed documents outweigh the interests that are protected by the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking” (<em>Amber Compounding</em> at [46]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband says that SUM 3414 is necessary given that the matrimonial jurisdiction of the Family Justice Court cannot be exercised to decide the legal rights of third parties, based on the CA’s decision in <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> (“<em>UDA”</em>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In <em>UDA</em>, the CA noted (at [51]) that there are four possible situations in which property may come before a court that is hearing an ancillary matters proceeding:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>a)     the property is accepted as a matrimonial asset, having been acquired jointly by the spouses or solely by one of them, and the only question is how it should be divided;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>b)     the property is in the name of one of the spouses and the issue is whether the circumstances of its acquisition render it a matrimonial asset;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>c)     the property is in the name of one of the spouses who claims to be holding it in trust for a third party, whilst the other spouse disputes this and contends that the property belongs beneficially to the legal owner and is therefore a matrimonial asset; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_d\"></a>d)     the property is in the name of a third party but one or both spouses claims that it is a matrimonial asset because the third party is holding the whole or part of the property on trust for one or both spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The CA noted (at [56]) that the following options are available if the property is legally owned by a third party:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a)     First, the spouse who claims the property to be a matrimonial asset may obtain legally binding confirmation from the third party that this is so and an undertaking that the third party would respect and enforce any order that the court may make relating to the beneficial interests in the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b)     If this is contested, either that spouse or the other who is asserting that the property belongs beneficially to the third party would have to start a separate legal action to have the rights in the property finally determined, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the third party, in which case the s 112 proceedings would have to be stayed until the rights are determined. This would be Option 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c)     The third possibility would be for the spouse to drop his or her claim that the property is a matrimonial asset and allow the s 112 proceedings to continue without it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d)     Alternatively, that spouse may ask the court to determine whether the asset is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party’s participation at all or making an order directly affecting the property. This is Option 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     With respect to Option 1, the CA provided the following guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">57     <b>In respect of [56(d)] above</b>, the family justice court should only take Option 1 <b>if both spouses agree to it</b>, as this course could result in the disputed asset being treated as a matrimonial asset and adjustments being made in the division of other assets to account for its value when in separate proceedings later it may be determined that the third party was both the legal and the beneficial owner of the property and neither spouse had any interest in it at all. Thus, the result of taking <b>Option 1 may be to prejudice the spouse who has had to account to the other for the value of an item of property which turns out not to be a matrimonial asset.</b> By the time of the separate action the s 112 proceedings may have completed and no adjustments may be possible to reflect the decision made in the third party’s separate proceedings. If both spouses do not agree to Option 1 in this situation, then directions would have to be given regarding the taking of separate proceedings against the third party and Option 2 would come into play. <b>We should add that Option 1 would not be viable if the disputed asset is the main or only substantial asset available for division.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">58    The other situation is where the property is in the name of one of the spouses and the third party is a “shadowy” figure in the wings whom that spouse claims has an interest in the property but no order is sought by or against the third party directly. In such a case, because no order is sought by or against the third party, it is permissible for the court to make an order exercising its powers under s 112 because the only parties directly affected by the order will be the parting spouses. This, again, is an Option 1 course. The choice of Option 1 would have the same risks for the spouses as alluded to in [57] above. Thus, for instance, <b>the spouse in whose name the property stands, having been ordered to share the value of the property with the other spouse, may later find he or she has to account to the third party for such value or to transfer the property outright to the third party</b>. <b>This is because the determination of the ownership of the disputed property in the s 112 proceedings will not bind the third party who may challenge it in separate proceedings. But that is the risk the spouse takes by not seeking an order that will bind the third party.</b> Once such an order is sought, in our view, this would be the same situation as discussed in [56(b)] above and a separate set of proceedings would have to be issued.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Husband, through his solicitors, sought clarification from the Wife <em>vide</em> their letter dated 27 October 2023, on whether the Wife, in her personal capacity and her capacity as a Personal Representative (“PR”) of the Estate of the Late Mr T, continues to maintain her position that Property A is an inheritance and not a divisible matrimonial asset and whether the other PR, Ms [TYS], aligns herself with the Wife’s position.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> In their reply dated 30 November 2023, the Wife’s solicitors indicated that they have not been instructed to act for the PRs of the Estate of the Late Mr T, but they have been instructed to act for the Wife in respect of the High Court action.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband contends that with the passing of the Late Mr T, the Executrices of his will, the Wife and her sister, are required to first administer the Estate. The PRs of an estate as well as the Estate of the Late Mr T are each considered at law to be third parties as far as D 1206 goes. Until all debts and liabilities of the Estate have been settled, no named beneficiaries of any property bequest can legally claim to have a beneficial interest in that property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband contends that the Executrices have steadfastly refused to disclose the progress of the probate. The Wife in her personal capacity also chose not to be helpful with disclosing the progress of the probate and avoiding the need for the Husband’s application. The Husband therefore has to start the Related HC Proceedings to determine whether the full beneficial interest to Property A has always belonged to the Wife or the Late Mr T since the current position is that there are third parties disputing that Property A is matrimonial property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife submits that there is no real dispute over who the beneficial interest in Property A will ultimately devolve to, and the Estate of the late Mr T is not a third party who has asserted beneficial ownership of Property A. Hence, separate proceedings in the General Division to determine the true beneficial ownership of property would be wholly unnecessary.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In light of the Wife’s submissions, it would be necessary to refer to <em>Ong Wui Teck (personal representative of the estate of Chew Chen Chin, deceased) v Ong Wui Swoon and another and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23775-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGCA 61</a> where the CA summarised the principles regulating the interests of beneficiaries of an estate as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    In our judgment, a personal representative ceases to be an executor and administrator only after all the assets of the estate have been vested in the personal representative, and the estate has been fully administered: see G Raman, <em>Probate and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2018) at para 12.19. This involves, <em>inter alia</em>, getting in all the assets of the estate, paying for any funeral, testamentary and administrative expenses, and satisfying all outstanding debts against the estate. As trustee, the personal representative then becomes concerned with the problems of distribution of the administered estate among the persons entitled: see <em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</em> (Alexander Learmonth <em>et al</em> gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2018) (“<em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks</em>”) at para 65-05. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65     <b>Once an executor decides that he no longer requires the estate’s assets for the satisfaction of the liabilities of the estate, he should then “assent” to the legacy</b>. This is explained by the learned authors of <em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks</em> at para 76-01 (see also Arthur Dean, “When Does an Executor become a Trustee?” (1935-1938) 1 Res Judicatae 92 at p 93):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">An assent has been described as an acknowledgment by a personal representative that an asset is no longer required for the payment of the debts, funeral expenses or general pecuniary legacies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">As has been shown all real and personal property to which a deceased person was entitled for an interest not ceasing on his death, now devolves upon his representatives. They are responsible for the satisfaction of the deceased’s debts to the extent of the whole estate, even though the testator may have directed that a portion of it should be applied to other purposes. In view of this liability they should not distribute any portion of the deceased’s estate until satisfied that such debts have been actually paid or are adequately secured, or can be paid without recourse to that portion of the estate. The personal representatives are protected against competing claims by the principle that <b>the beneficiaries’ title to the deceased’s property</b>, whether devisees, legatees or persons entitled on intestacy, <b>is not complete until some act of the representatives themselves makes it so. This act, according to the circumstances, is either an assent or a conveyance, and until it has taken place the administration continues.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">66     <b>It follows that before the debts and liabilities of the estate have been fully settled, the beneficiaries to the will cannot claim to have a beneficial interest in the assets of the estate, since some of the assets may have to be used in satisfaction of the said debts and liabilities</b>. Therefore, if the beneficiaries do not have an equitable interest in the assets of the Estate, the personal representative cannot be regarded as a trustee over those assets. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     It is clear from the above passages that a beneficiary’s title to a deceased’s property is not complete until the executor decides that he no longer requires the estate’s assets for the satisfaction of the liabilities of the estate and assents to the legacy. Until then, the beneficiary cannot claim to have a beneficial interest in the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>VIK v VIL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24850-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 12</a>, the court noted (at [53]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The question of whether an assent exists is a fact-sensitive one, since an assent may be informal and may also be inferred from conduct: <em>Seah Teong Kang</em> at [27]. In respect of Property 1 and Property 2, there is no evidence of any assent on the part of the Administrator, and none of the parties have sought to argue as such. It follows that both Property 1 and Property 2 are not held on trust by the Administrator, and the appropriate regime of law is that which applies to execution and administration of an estate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, the Wife has not provided evidence of any assent and neither has she argued as such. In the absence of such evidence, the Wife cannot claim to have a beneficial interest in Property A qua beneficiary of her father’s will. In addition, there is no evidence to show that the debts and liabilities of the Estate have been fully settled. It would not be correct, as a matter of law, to assume that the beneficial interest in Property A will ultimately devolve to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In the circumstances, the facts of the present case fall within the situation described in paragraph 51(d) of <em>UDA</em>, <em>i.e.</em> the property is in the name of a third party (i.e., the Estate of Mr T) but one spouse (the Husband) claims that it is a matrimonial asset because the third party is holding the whole of the property on trust for the other spouse (the Wife).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Since Property A is legally owned by a third party, there are two options under paragraph 56 of <em>UDA</em> that come into play: “Option 1” (<em>UDA</em> at [56(d)]) and “Option 2” (<em>UDA</em> at [56(b)]). The other two options listed in paragraph 56 are not engaged on the facts of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Wife submits that Option 1 would be the most straightforward, expeditious and cost-effective way forward for parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Under this option, the Family Justice Court may determine whether the asset is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party’s participation or making an order directly affecting the property. In other words, there would be no necessity for the Husband to start a separate legal action to have the rights in the property determined<em>, vis-à-vis</em> the third party, nor is there a need to stay the s 112 proceedings until the rights are determined, as would be the case if Option 2 is adopted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As noted in <em>UDA</em> (at [57]), the Family Justice Court should only take Option 1 if both spouses agree to it, as this course could result in the disputed asset being treated as a matrimonial asset and adjustments being made in the division of other assets to account for its value when in separate proceedings later it may be determined that the third party was both the legal and the beneficial owner of the property and neither spouse had any interest in it at all. Thus, the result of taking Option 1 may be to the prejudice of the spouse who has to account to the other for the value of an item of property which turns out not to be a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, the Wife has opted for Option 1 even though she is the party who may be prejudiced by this course of action since she is the one who has to account for the value of Property A. In contrast, the Husband does not bear such risk. So long as both parties agree, the question whether Property A is a matrimonial asset can be appropriately determined in the ancillary matters hearing without the need for the Husband to commence separate civil action at all. Clearly then, the only obstacle to Option 1 is the Husband’s refusal to agree to it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Husband has highlighted concerns that (i) any orders made by the Family Justice Court in proceedings to divide assets in the divorce proceedings will not bind third party including the PRs of the Estate who may have an interest in a matrimonial asset that is being divided, and (ii) any determination of ownership of a property, to which beneficial ownership is in dispute, in ancillary matters may face challenges by a third party affected by such a determination in separate proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     However, it should be noted that Option 1 does not involve the court making an order directly affecting the property. The risk, if any, lies with the Wife as the spouse who has to account for the value of the disputed asset. The Wife recognises as such and is prepared to proceed on such a basis.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As the Husband has a real enough choice of taking up Option 1, the AR was correct in her finding that the Related HC Proceedings are unnecessary. Further, although the Husband has clarified that he filed SUM 3414 for the sole purpose of being permitted to start the Related HC Proceedings,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> the scope of the orders sought by the Husband is very wide and goes beyond that. If Prayer 1 of SUM 3414 is granted, it would have the effect of releasing the Husband of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking from “any other purposes”. There is nothing in Prayer 2 that limits the effect of Prayer 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that there is no real necessity for the Husband to commence the Related HC Proceedings and taking into account the expansive nature of the orders sought by the Husband, the Wife’s apprehension that the Husband may misuse the documents and information if he is released of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking is not without basis. This risk cannot be discounted given the conduct of the Husband as observed in FC/RA 1/2023 and HCF/RAS 4/2023. Additionally, his frequent change of solicitors deepens my concern about the propensity on his part to engage in a course of conduct that is unnecessarily acrimonious and confrontational.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     On balance, it was clear to me that the interests that are protected by the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking outweigh the interests advanced by the Husband for the use of the Disclosed Documents and Information. Accordingly, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 92</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     SUM 92 is an application by the Husband for leave to respond to certain paragraphs of the Wife’s Reply Ancillary Matters Affidavit dated 28 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Husband’s appeal is concerned with six items identified in S/No. 1, 4, 6, 9, 10 and 12 (the “Appealed Items”) of the Table of Positions exhibited in the Husband’s Supporting Affidavit filed in SUM 92 on 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The AR disallowed the Husband’s application broadly on the basis that the proposed responses or new evidence is unnecessary or has limited impact to the outstanding issues to be determined.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Husband submits that leave should be granted to reply to the Appealed Items as the evidence he intends to adduce will facilitate a fair adjudication of the ancillary matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Out of the six Appealed Items, five are relevant to the issue of indirect contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> and one is relevant under s 112(2)(g) of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Husband says that the parties are still in a relatively early stage of the ancillary matters as a hearing date has not been fixed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> If the evidence that he is seeking to admit at this juncture is disallowed and turns out to be important in an appeal in future, it would not satisfy the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> rule and the Husband would thus suffer prejudice.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Wife submits that the affidavit filed by the Husband in support of SUM 92 is his twelfth affidavit. The Husband has already had ample opportunity to present his case whether through his AOM, or in the course of the several applications filed by him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Husband refers to the broad principle of law in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGCA 0015.xml')\">[2010] SGCA 15</a> where the CA emphasised that “every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence relevant to his or her case to the attention of the court” and where “the relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful”, it is “usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Husband also refers to <em>SIC College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh Siah</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18440-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 5</a> where the CA held as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is axiomatic that in order to arrive at a fully considered decision based on justice and fairness, the court concerned must have all the relevant evidence before it. The present appeal turns on this one fundamental point. Put simply, was all the relevant evidence before the judge in the court below? If it was not, then there would have been no way for the judge to have arrived at a considered decision simply because he would have been in receipt of the full picture.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In my view, these general principles must be considered against the unique nature of proceedings for the division of matrimonial assets where different considerations apply. As noted by Debbie Ong J (as she then was) in <em>UYP v UYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23358-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 16</a> (“<em>UYP</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">63    It is significant to note that a civil trial is markedly different from an AM proceeding. In civil proceedings, parties set out their cases in their pleadings and are bound by them. Facts which are pleaded to support a cause of action are proved in the court proceedings. Where there are gaps in evidence and a party asserting a fact is unable to prove it, he or she may not have discharged the requisite burden of proof. A successful litigant would be one who has proved his or her pleaded facts that support the pleaded case. A court may find against a litigant who fails to provide evidence to prove those facts. <b>In contrast, in proceedings for the division of MAs, the court is presented with only a fraction of each party’s “contribution” to the marriage, yet parties seek the court’s determination on what is a just division based substantially on each party’s direct and indirect contributions in the </b><b><em>entire marriage</em></b><b>. Had a similar approach as that used in civil matters been taken, the Family Court presented with a 30-year marriage would have had to examine the entire contributions and conduct of each spouse over 30 years, possibly examining the daily records of each act done, each decision made, each word uttered every day and night over 30 years, for that is the only way to fully assess what contributions each had made to the marriage. This is an impossible exercise. Neither does such an exercise accord with the aspirations of the family justice system to enable the harmonious resolution of family disputes and for parties to continue family life after divorce in the most dignified manner possible.</b> The court determines the division of assets by affidavit evidence unless leave is granted for the cross-examination of witnesses (see rr 42, 81(2) and 590 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014)). This mode of proceedings is suitable because the “broad brush” approach is core to the exercise of discretion in s 112. It is appropriate because marriage is an intimate partnership between two spouses who had decided very solemnly to join their lives together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    Thus when applying the <em>ANJ v ANK</em> approach, the court must bear in mind that findings on the parties’ contributions are necessarily impressionistic as it can only have sight of a portion of all that had occurred during the marriage, and will not be able to reach with mathematical specificity each party’s contributions for the entire length of the marriage. This is especially true for long marriages, as the court’s finding on the parties’ “contribution” cannot fully reflect all that goes into building a life together nor will it be likely that records of transactions remain completely available. This observation should not be taken to suggest that parties should therefore dredge up their past in order to present to the court 30 years’ worth of daily journal records on their married lives. On the contrary, this would run counter to how family disputes ought to be resolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The CA in <em>UYQ v UYP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24104-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 3</a>, in affirming the learned judge’s views, reiterated (at [4]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In our view, it would assist the parties to find a way forward and put this painful chapter of their lives behind them by focusing on the <em>major details</em> as opposed to every conceivable detail under the sun. We caveat that this does not mean parties should swing to the other extreme by being remiss in submitting the relevant records. Put simply, there ought to be <em>reasonable accounting rigour that eschews flooding the court with details that would obscure rather than illuminate</em>. Henceforth, therefore, courts should discourage parties from applying the <em>ANJ v ANK</em> approach in a rigid and calculative manner. Parties would do well to understand that such an approach <em>detracts</em> from their respective cases instead of enhancing them. And in extreme situations where the court’s time and resources have been wasted in a wholly disproportionate manner, a party may face sanctions in the form of the appropriate costs orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Further, under rule 89 of the Family Justice Rules, parties are only permitted to file one AOM and a reply affidavit to the other party’s AOM. Rule 89(3) provides that no further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the court. The purpose of rule 89 is to discourage parties from filing multiple rounds of affidavits that would only increase legal costs and acrimony and drag out court time unnecessarily. By limiting the number of affidavits, it provides a cut-off point so that parties do not engage in a never-ending cycle of reply and rebuttal over every allegation raised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In my view, the AR had exercised her discretion correctly in refusing to grant leave to the Husband to file a further affidavit to respond to the Appealed Items. The reasonings provided by the AR are consistent with the principles enunciated in <em>UYP</em> and the raison d'être of rule 89. Bearing in mind the “broad brush” approach which is core to the exercise of the discretion in s 112 of the Charter, I found nothing exceptional in the reasons provided by the Husband that would warrant a departure from the default position that limits parties to two affidavits each. In circumstances, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note:
