They had married in April 2016. An interim judgment dissolving the marriage was decreed in November 2021 based on unreasonable behaviour of the Wife. The marriage had lasted 5 years and 7 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       There are 2 children of the marriage. It is agreed that the parties share joint custody of the children. The outstanding issues for me to decide on are the care, control, access and maintenance of the children, the maintenance of the Wife, as well as the division of property between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">THE CHILDREN</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In this section, I shall refer to the Husband as “the Father” and to the Wife as “the Mother”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There are 2 children. The 1<sup>st</sup> child is 7 years old, and the second is 5 years old. They are both boys.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The parties agree to having joint custody of both children. The issue is who shall care and control the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father claims to be the primary caregiver of the children. He is a taxi driver. He fetches them from childcare/school every day, prepares meals for them, eats with them, gives them showers and goes through their schoolwork or play with them. He brings the children out on weekends when he does not work. He brings them for medical treatments and attends meetings with teachers especially regarding one of the children’s speech delay and autism. He handles the administrative matters with the school. The Father alleges that the Mother had committed violence against the children, but his application for a personal protection order on their behalf was dismissed by this Court. The Father also argues that the Mother is likely to return to Vietnam and take the children with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother claims that she is the primary caregiver of the children. She also claims to prepare the children and sends them to childcare. She discusses with their teachers. In the evenings after work she spends time with the children and puts them to bed. She claims that the Father is not interested in the children. The Mother also applied for a personal protection order against the Father, but her complaint was also dismissed by this Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I heard counsel for the parties, and I ordered for a child custody evaluation to be conducted. I have now received the report of the evaluators and consider it together with the other evidence already placed before me in the parties’ affidavits. Because many of the interviews conducted during the custody evaluation took place under a promise and expectation of non-disclosure, I will not make specific references of the contents of the report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Based on the report and the evidence before me, I arrive at the following findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_1\"></a>1.     Both parents are involved in the caregiving of the children. They both love the children and are familiar with their temperaments and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_2\"></a>2.     The 1<sup>st</sup> child is diagnosed with autism since he was 3 years old. His autism is mild, and he is coping well academically. The 2<sup>nd</sup> child appears to have no special needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_3\"></a>3.     The children had expressed to the evaluator that they wish to live with the Mother. However, this attachment between them and the Mother is a result of their triangulation, and that they were simply reflecting the Mother’s emotional needs. They are parentified in this regard. If they are placed in the Mother’s care, it is likely that the parentification will become more entrenched and their development affected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_4\"></a>4.     On the other hand, the children do have a healthy attachment to the Father. The Father’s parenting is firm, but also warm. He is observed to be able to set boundaries and regular routines for the children and managing their behaviours whereas the Mother has difficulties doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_5\"></a>5.     The Father already has a fully paid-up home to accommodate the children, whereas the Mother’s accommodation is uncertain, since she rents a bedroom in a 4-room flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I find that there is no reason to not order the parents to have joint custody of the children. In any case, they have agreed to this. Both parents have the best interest of the children at heart, and I believe that they will co-parent effectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I find that it will be in the welfare of the children that they be in the care and control of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The children must have access with the Mother. There is no evidence to show that it would be against their welfare to have access with the Mother. I shall adopt an access arrangement recommended by the evaluator, as I find that it is fair and workable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Mother requests that the Father not know her address claiming that she fears he will harass her there. Parents who share joint custody of children, in order to exercise their parental responsibilities, must at least be aware of the children’s whereabouts when the children are with the other parent. The accusations of family violence have been dismissed. I find that there is no more basis to prevent the Father from knowing the Mother’s address because that is where the children will be residing at during access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I therefore conclude that it is in the welfare of the children to order as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_1\"></a>1.     By consent, both parents shall have joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_2\"></a>2.     The children shall be in the care and control of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3\"></a>3.     The Father shall provide the children with access to the Mother as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_a\"></a>a.       On weekends alternating between the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_a-p4_A\"></a>(A)       First weekend: Friday after school to Monday morning. The Mother will collect the children from their schools on Friday and she shall send the children to school on Monday; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_a-p4_B\"></a>(B)       Other weekend: Friday after school to Saturday evening at 8pm, when the Father shall collect the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_b\"></a>b.       During school holidays, every Friday from 5pm on Friday to Saturday 9pm, when the Father shall collect the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_c\"></a>c.       Every Wednesday after school until 8:30pm. The Mother shall collect the children from school and shall return them to the Father by 8:30pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_d\"></a>d.       The children shall also have access to the Mother via electronic means during non-access periods, and the Father shall have access to the children via electronic means during access periods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_e\"></a>e.       The children shall have access with the Mother during the first half of school vacations. The Mother shall collect the children from school at the start of the school vacation and the Father shall collect them on the second Saturday at 9pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_f\"></a>f.       For Chinese New Year, the children shall be with the Father on the first day, and the children shall have access with the Mother on the second day from 9am to 6pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_g\"></a>g.       For public holidays other than Chinese New Year, the children shall have access with the Mother on alternate public holidays from 9am to 6pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_h\"></a>h.       The parents shall not comment about each other in the children’s presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_i\"></a>i.       Neither the Father nor the Mother shall by himself/herself, his/her agents or his/her servants, bring the children, out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the other or an Order of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_3-p3_j\"></a>j.       Both parents and the children shall attend counselling at FAM@FSC as well as the Children-in-Between Programme.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance of the children </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On maintenance for the children, the Father seeks the Mother to pay $778.80 a month. The Father says that the children’s monthly expenses are $1,180.00. He argues that the Mother ought to bear 66%, or $778.80.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother says that the children’s expenses are $420.00 for each child. This does not include housing, so she asks for $600.00 a month each to cover their housing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The children are 6 and 4 years old at the time of hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Means of parents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father is a taxi driver claiming to earn a take home income of $1,800.00 a month. The Mother disputes this and claims that he earns about $5,000.00 a month. She points out that the Father did not produce evidence from his taxi company to show his monthly collections.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In this regard, I find that the Father’s income tax assessment is prima facie proof that his income is $18,000.00 a year, which is $1,500.00 a month, lower than what the Father claims. I therefore accept $1,800.00 a month as the Father’s income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother is a waitress taking home $2,044.96. She pays $1,800 in rent. This leaves her disposable income at $244.96.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The total means of the parties is therefore $2,044.96 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Expenses of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am conscious that there is no requirement that every expense must be proved (<em>UEB v UEC</em> [2018] SGHFC 5, at paragraph 13). I instead apply a broad brush in evaluating the expenses and come to my findings on them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I accept the evidence of the Father that the expenses of the 1<sup>st</sup> child are $750.00 a month, and the expenses of the 2<sup>nd</sup> child are $430.00 a month. I find that these are reasonable taking into account the needs of the children and the means of the parents. The total is $1,180.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allocation of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The legal position is that each parent has an equal responsibility to maintain the children it but does not mean that they have to bear equal shares of the burden (<em>BPC v BPB</em> [2019] 1 SLR 642, at paragraph 111).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I take into account that I have ordered the care and control of the children to be with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Based on her disposable income, that the Mother’s proportionate share to contribute to the children’s maintenance is 12%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Pursuant to the orders of access I have made above, the children will be spending a considerable amount of time with the Mother – on Wednesday evenings, and on weekends from Friday after school. During these periods, the Mother must bear the children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I apply a broad brush to this issue and find it to be fair and reasonable for each parent to bear all the expenses of the children when the children are with them. I therefore make no order that the Mother pay any monthly maintenance for the children to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, I find it to be fair and reasonable to order that the Mother shall bear 12% of common expenses such as school fees, tuition fees and medical expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Hereinafter I shall refer to the Plaintiff as “the Husband” and to the Defendant as “the Wife”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Jointly owned asset</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There are no jointly owned assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It is not disputed that the Husband has the following in his own name:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"11.9176164767047%\"><col width=\"48.5902819436113%\"><col width=\"39.4921015796841%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">DBS bank account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$784.80</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF accounts</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$277,618.04</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$278,805.56</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband has a UOB savings account shares with his ex-wife containing $424.72. The Husband has a joint saving account with his daughter from his previous marriage containing $501.63. I exclude these from the asset pool as they do not fall in within the definition of matrimonial asset under section 112 (10) of the Women’s Charter, since they were not acquired during the present marriage, nor substantially improved during the marriage nor used for the purposes of the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband has 2 CDA accounts for 2 children.

He brings the children out on weekends when he does not work. He brings them for medical treatments and attends meetings with teachers on one of the children’s speech delay and autism. He handles the administrative matters with the school. He points out that the Wife left the matrimonial home and became uncontactable for a month in April 2020, and he claims that even then the Wife did not bother with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Wife says that she made half of the indirect contributions. She says that after marrying the Husband she relocated to Singapore but was unable to find employment, so she could not contribute financially to the home. She sold her property in Vietnam which she inherited from her deceased previous husband, and used the proceeds of the sale to buy a smaller property in Vietnam. She says that she alone made the payments for the purchase. Indeed, she claims that the reason she sold the property was because she needed the funds as the Husband had ceased to give financial support for her and the children. She says that after the birth of the 2<sup>nd</sup> child the Husband stopped maintaining her and the children even though she was not yet a permanent resident and so was unable to work. She says she was in a constant state of fear and uncertainty, and there were days that she did not have enough to eat. She says that a year later the Husband threw her out of the home, and she had to sleep in a park. She says that when she begged to return, the Husband demanded that she pay him $400 a month for rent. She says that she obtained permanent residency in April 2021 which she paid for herself. She took on more than one job. With her income she was able to purchase appliances such as fans, cooking apparatus, crockery, pillows, bedsheets and daily household necessities. She claims that she is the primary caregiver of the children. She also claims to prepare the children and sends them to childcare. She discusses with their teachers. She cooks for the family. She buys groceries. In the evenings she spends time with the children and puts them to bed. She cleans the home. She claims that the Husband is not interested in the children and does not assist in the housework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The marriage was 5 years long. There are 2 children. Both parents worked to support the family. They both made sacrifices, and at times supported each other financially. I apply a broad brush to the facts before me.

I order that the Husband shall pay to the Wife the remaining amount of $97,676.46. I shall deal with this together with the issue of the Wife’s maintenance below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance of the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Wife seeks an order of maintenance for herself in the monthly sum of $600.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As previously stated, the Wife is a waitress earning $2,044.96 a month. She pays most of that for rent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Husband argues that there ought to be no order of maintenance for the Wife. He argues that the Wife is relatively young and able bodies, whereas he is in the sunset of his career. He submits that the Wife has failed to make full and frank disclosure about her access to funds. He argues that the Wife rent payment is not proved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Whether or not I ought to order the Husband to pay maintenance to the Wife is a multifactorial inquiry (<em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20026-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 15</a> at [62]). It is supplementary to my order on the division of the assets (<em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [33]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Wife has $1,461.90 in her bank account. I have found her share of the matrimonial asset pool to be $110,030.92, of which the Husband is to pay her $97,676.46. These should be sufficient provision for the Wife to transit to a post-divorce life and provides a clean break in the parties’ marital relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I therefore order that the Husband to pay a lump sum of maintenance to the Wife in the sum of $97,676.46 within 6 months of the date of final judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Wife is legally aided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Husband succeeded on the issues of care and control of the children, as well as the division of assets. The Wife succeeded on the issue of maintenance to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I find that it is fair and just to make no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Clarification</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     After I released the above judgment, Counsel for the Wife wrote in requesting a clarification on 2 issues. The first issue is about the interpretation of the terms of access. Counsel says that the term “weekends alternating between first weekend and other weekend” is confusing and requests clarification. In reply, Counsel for the Husband agrees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I agree. In order to clarify the order, I amend it to as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Custody care and control of children of the marriage</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    By consent, both parents shall have joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    The children shall be in the care and control of the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    The Plaintiff shall provide the children with access to the Defendant as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <u>a</u>.     <u>Every weekend, alternating back and forth between the following:</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<u>A</u>)     <u>Friday after school to Monday morning.

The Wife’s Counsel suggests that the amount be transferred from the Husband’s CPF to the Wife instead, and that there be no order on maintenance for the Wife. The learned Counsel for the Husband concurs with this view.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I did not make an order to transfer from the Husband’s CPF to the Wife simply because it was not requested for by the Wife during the course of the hearing.

P and his wife (the mother of the defendants) have been separated since 2014 when P left the matrimonial home to stay with the plaintiff and her children. The plaintiff also sought by way of summons 3230/2023, to be a joint deputy with the defendants, should the revocation application not be granted. She sought to be allowed access to P which was strongly resisted by the defendants.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Having considered the evidence, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>a.     The application for the revocation of the deputyship order was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>b.     The plaintiff however shall be appointed as deputy jointly with the defendants insofar as it relates to the management of P’s personal welfare. The management of P’s property and affairs shall continue to remain with the defendants who are subject to the supervision of the Office of the Public Guardian and would need to report annually on the performance of their obligations in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>c.     P shall continue to stay with the defendants if there is no agreement amongst the parties on the living arrangements for P. The plaintiff shall be permitted to visit and care for P daily if she wishes to and shall be jointly responsible for the management of P’s health. All parties are to be privy to communication with caregivers and medical professionals and all decisions are to be made jointly in the interests of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>d.     Each party is to bear his/her own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The plaintiff appeals against the order dismissing the application for the revocation of the deputyship order and the dismissal of her request to be appointed as co-deputy for P’s property and affairs. The defendants appeal against all orders save for the order dismissing the application for revocation of the deputyship order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Undisputed Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The plaintiff and P entered a romantic relationship when P was still married. P moved in with the plaintiff and the latter’s children in 2014. Between 2015 and 2022 the couple travelled together on at least 24 occasions to various destinations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>A motorcycle accident whilst in Krabi in 2016 resulted in P’s urgent return to Singapore. He was admitted to a hospital and brain scans revealed the need for surgery. P did not provide his consent. Although he appeared to show improvement a few months after the accident, P’s health declined significantly from 2018. He was also diagnosed with dementia in January 2020 after a fall while at the plaintiff’s home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       P’s wife filed for divorce in April 2021. In July 2022, the defendants filed an application seeking an order for their appointment as deputies (FC/OSM233/2022). They did not inform the Court of the relationship between P and the plaintiff and only detailed the immediate family members as relevant persons. One of the key reasons in seeking the appointment was to enable counsel to be instructed to act for P in the divorce proceedings. Interim judgment was granted on 9 November 2021 and orders on ancillary matters have been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I issued the order appointing the defendants as deputies in September 2022, having been satisfied that they had a proper plan to care for P and as children of P, are likely to provide long term care for their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In April 2023, a summons was filed by the defendants seeking that the plaintiff be prevented from access to P. It was only then known to the Court that P was in a long-term relationship with the plaintiff. I had directed that the summons be served on the plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In August 2023, the plaintiff filed the present application in OSM 253/2023 and subsequently in October 2023, summons 3230/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Should the order be revoked on account of non-disclosure of a relevant fact?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Section 20 (7) of the Mental Capacity Act (2008) (MCA) provides for a Court to discharge a deputyship order or vary the same. Section 20(8) of the Act provides specific circumstances when an appointment of a deputy may be revoked. For ease of reference, these are when a Court is satisfied that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>a</em>)     <em>A deputy is convicted, on or after 1 September 2018 (but not before the deputy’s appointment by the court), of an offence (whenever committed) of criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, cheating, theft or extortion or any other offence involving fraud or dishonestly, whether as against P or another person;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>b</em>)     <em>The deputy engages or has engaged in conduct that contravenes the deputy’s authority conferred by the court, or that is not in P’s best interests (whether or not the deputy is acting under a court order);</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>c</em>)     <em>The deputy proposes to engage in conduct that would contravene the deputy’s authority conferred by the court, or that would not be in P’s best interests (whether or not the deputy is acting under a court order); or</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>d</em>)     <em>Where the deputy is a professional deputy, the registration of the deputy as a professional deputy is cancelled.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When the defendants filed their application to be appointed as deputies, their counsel at the time did not inform the Court that P was in a relationship with the plaintiff and that they were living together. An application to be appointed as a deputy can be made by anyone who has been giving care or is able to give care to P. It is not only available to family members. In fact, in the supporting affidavit filed by the defendants in support of their appointment in OSM 233/2022, they omitted to indicate the name of the plaintiff in a table which is titled “other relevant persons” and which provides examples of such persons to be those that are in a close relationship with P or who give care to P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The omission to inform the Court of this has serious consequences as it shut out the plaintiff and prevented her voice from being heard. Even if the children of P may not have a good relationship with the plaintiff and may even view her as instrumental in the break-up of the relationship between their parents, they cannot take the position that P need not have the plaintiff participate in P’s care. If it is evident that P wanted the plaintiff to be a part of his life, the responsibility of a Court is to take that into consideration in determining the best care plan for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     P has lost his autonomy to decide on matters pertaining to his personal welfare and property and affairs. It would be important to look at the words and actions of P while he had the capacity to make his own decisions, on what would serve him when he no longer has that capacity. In fact, the newly engaged counsel for the defendants acknowledged that the defendants’ omission to state the plaintiff as a relevant person, was regrettable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The omission of facts may well occasion the revocation of orders if material. This was seen in <b><em>Wong Meng Cheong</em></b> v <b><em>Ling Ai Wah</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> where the Court found <em>inter alia</em> that the conduct of the deputies was reprehensible and violated the interests of P. In the case before me, the failure to recognise the plaintiff as a relevant person does not in and of itself necessitate a revocation unless the appointment of the defendants was inappropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Was the appointment of the defendants as deputies appropriate?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     There is a need for stable and sustainable care for persons without mental capacity. The appointment of adult children as deputies for their parent(s) is desirable, provided they have the capacity to care and have good care plans in place. With P’s marriage having been dissolved, the closest family members of P are his children. They are both working adults and are well placed to care for P and to manage his property and affairs. The nature of kinship made their appointments for the long term feasible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     It was the position of the plaintiff that when the defendants were appointed as deputies, they did not give proper care to P. She spoke for example of an incident caught on her closed-circuit television which showed that the 2nd defendant was on his mobile phone while P struggled to get into bed to rest. This and all other allegations of neglect was vehemently denied by the defendants. They made their own allegations against the plaintiff. It was their position that P was a fit and healthy individual prior to him leaving the matrimonial home to stay with the plaintiff. They pointed to various incidents of neglect even as recently as February 2023 which resulted in another admission to hospital. Allegations of neglect were similarly denied by the plaintiff. It would be difficult to assess the accuracy of the allegations made by the parties. Caregiving is challenging and no caregiver is perfect. While I understand the emotion behind the allegations, I did not find any pattern of neglect by either the plaintiff or the defendants. Much of the events after the hospital admission in February 2023 however, were relevant to the applications before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Upon his discharge from hospital, the defendants placed P in a serviced apartment. This appeared to have also been an effort to prevent access to the plaintiff. The plaintiff pointed to the fact that P had been moved from one hotel/service apartment to another from March 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> without anyone giving him proper care. She said she visited him every day, much to the chagrin of the defendants who did not permit such visitation. She claimed that P was not fed properly, and medication not properly administered. Again, this was denied by the defendants. The defendants then took active steps to restrict or prevent the plaintiff’s access to P. The defendants also pointed to a withdrawal of a total amount of $450 000 from P’s bank account during the period P was staying with the plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> As P is a man of sound financial means, the suggestion was that the plaintiff ought not to oversee P’s financial matters to prevent any possible mismanagement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I was concerned by the fact that P was made to move from one hotel to another. More permanent accommodation and care arrangements should have been put in place when or shortly after the orders appointing the defendants as deputies were issued. Any mistrust they had over the care provided by the plaintiff was not responded to by the provision of better care but instead, what appears to be even poorer arrangements. An individual in P’s shoes would require close supervision, good nutrition, and a stable physical environment. P was largely left to himself in these hotels. I expressed this to the defendants’ previous counsel during various case conferences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     When the matter came up for hearing, the care arrangements were significantly different. A two-bedroom apartment was rented for P to stay in and a full-time helper for his care was engaged by the defendants. The 2nd defendant spoke of how he attended a 3-day course to help him care for P better and a dietician was engaged to plan P’s meals.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     While the initial plans of the defendants fell short of what would be expected for P, the steps the defendants have taken since, and which are in place today, are satisfactory. While it is possible that the defendants took these steps quickly in order to satisfy the Court, I do not believe that they would renege on their obligations after the hearing. There was no need for the revocation of the order. The question that stood to be considered instead was whether the request of the plaintiff to be a co-deputy of P ought to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Would it be in the best interests of P to enable the plaintiff to be a co-deputy?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It is understandable that the children of P have a deep sense of suspicion and even scepticism towards the plaintiff who entered a relationship with their father when the latter was still married. Even as she claimed that she did not know he was married at the time the relationship started, she came to know of it but continued. While the feelings of the children can certainly be understood, it is not the Court’s place to deny the plaintiff a place in the care of P if it was appropriate to do so. P and the plaintiff were in a close relationship, and it was P’s desire to stay with the plaintiff. The plaintiff did accompany P for his various medical appointments, and they lived as a family with the plaintiff’s children. Section 6 of the MCA addresses the issue of best interests and specifically provides at s 6(8) that a Court should consider:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">a)     <em>the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and in particular, any relevant written statement made by the person when the person had capacity);</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">b)     <em>the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his or her decision if the person had capacity; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">c)     <em>the other factors that the person would be likely to consider if the person were able to do so</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I was of the view that the plaintiff should continue to play a part in the personal welfare of P and ordered accordingly. P was clearly comfortable in the plaintiff’s presence as seen in various <em>Whatsapp</em> messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was no need to deny her continued engagement in his care. At the same time, the health of P was such that it was imperative that there be a constant care provider and minimal disruption to his routine. The presence of a domestic helper at his rented residence which was situated in an area that he was familiar with, was closer to the ideal than to move him back to the plaintiff’s residence. More importantly, P requires care that the plaintiff may not be able to manage effectively, given that she is a working adult. P’s needs may increase over time and a helper who is accessible at all times would be prudent. I ordered that the plaintiff may visit P at any time if P does not live with her and that she be engaged on any medical decisions that may need to be taken. I did not accept the defendants’ position that the plaintiff was a poor caregiver as seen in the numerous times that P had fallen ill when in her care. They pointed to an incident where P ended up in hospital after the plaintiff took him for a meal at a hotel. Given that P suffers from gout, certain foods provided in the buffet should not, they alleged, have been consumed. This reductionist approach to the issue of care was not helpful. For the incident at the hotel, the plaintiff chose to take P for a meal and did not have any intention to cause harm. Unfortunately, the consumption of unsuitable food led to P having to be admitted to hospital. Often even with the best of care, incidents like these do happen. Health issues including gout, a motorcycle accident, a fall while at home – these collectively contributed to the deterioration of P’s health. There was nothing in the evidence that points clearly to the plaintiff as having been so negligent as to have caused it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Similarly, I did not find the argument that the poor relationship between parties is a reason to disqualify the plaintiff from working with the defendants in the care of P. The parties, as adult caregivers share a close relationship with P. There may be many differences in how care should be given. The idea however is to work together and for each to step up in areas where another may not be able to. All the deputies work outside the home and do not have the ability to provide care at all times. Rather more realistically, the domestic helper will be the one managing the day to day needs of P. As explained above, the most challenging issue was where P should stay, and I had ordered that he may remain in his current condominium unit with his children attending to him there if an alternative was not agreed to. It was inappropriate to restrict access by the plaintiff to P and to disengage her from P’s care. However, I did not entrust the plaintiff with the management of P’s property and affairs. Given the suggestion that monies may have been withdrawn in the past from P’s bank account(s) and which therefore require further investigation, and the fact that P had gone through divorce proceedings very recently, necessitated in my view, some degree of caution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I had ordered that each party was to bear his or her own costs. Typically for applications under the MCA, costs are drawn from the estate of the person to be assisted (<b><em>TRD</em></b> v <b><em>TRE &amp; Ors</em></b>.)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> unless some other order is warranted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In this case, the plaintiff was not successful in her main application to revoke the deputyship order nor her request to be appointed as a co-deputy for the property and affairs of P even as she was successful in being appointed as a co-deputy for the personal welfare of P. The defendants even though successful in resisting the revocation of the deputyship order had omitted to inform the Court of the plaintiff’s close relationship with their father which occasioned this litigation. In the circumstances, I was of the view that each party was to bear his or her own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     When an individual loses his or her mental capacity, the person who is appointed as deputy would need to always act to serve the best interests of the person to be assisted. The tendency to believe that a certain course of action is in the best interests of P when it is in fact a course that fits the values and beliefs of the deputy would need to be avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     On the totality of the evidence, it is my view that there was no need to revoke the order appointing the children as deputies. The need for long-term sustainable plans is crucial for P’s wellbeing. I believe the children will be able to provide this. It bears repeating that no plan is perfect but perfect efforts must always be exercised. The omission to identify the plaintiff as a relevant person while regrettable, is not fatal.

He alleged that his wife had, in her attempts to remove from his care the youngest – infant – child of theirs, placed all four children in fear of hurt. Having heard the evidence of the spouses and the three older children, I granted PPOs in favour of the three older children but limited those PPOs to a duration of a year. I declined to grant a PPO in favour of the infant. I also directed the spouses and the children (save for the infant) to attend counselling with a view to helping the spouses to co-parent the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The wife has filed an appeal against these decisions. I now provide my reasons for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The spouses married in 2022. They had the infant, who was their sole biological child, in January 2023. Apart from the infant, they had three older children (the “stepchildren”) from a previous marriage of the husband. The stepchildren were respectively 12, 9, and 8 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Unfortunately, fissures developed in the marriage. By early-2023, the spouses had commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court. The spouses began living separately, with the stepchildren in the care of the husband and the infant in the care of the wife. But the access of the husband to the infant remained a source of disagreement between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 26 May 2023, pursuant to an informal arrangement between the spouses, the husband picked up the infant from the residence of the wife. Pursuant to that arrangement, too, the husband was to return the infant to the care of the wife on 28 May 2023. But further disagreements ensued between the spouses over the infant, and the husband did not so return the infant to the care of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 29 May 2023, the solicitors for the wife sent a letter to the husband. In that letter, they demanded that he return the infant to her care “within 24 hours of receiving this letter (no later than by 12 Noon on Wednesday, 31 May 2023).” The letter added: “Failure to comply with this demand will leave our client with no alternative but to pursue legal remedies available to her to ensure the immediate return of the [infant] and seek appropriate legal action to protect the rights of our client”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 31 May 2023, after the husband did not comply with this demand, the wife, her mother, and her younger sister appeared uninvited at his residence, which was a rental flat. They knocked repeatedly on his door and demanded the infant. After the husband opened the door, they pushed it open despite his attempts to close it. They left only after the husband called for the assistance of the police. Throughout this episode, the stepchildren and the infant were with the husband in the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 1 June 2023, the wife and her mother returned to the flat of the husband and knocked repeatedly on the door. The husband who was in the flat declined to open the door and sent a text message to the wife telling her to stop the knocking. Nevertheless, the knocking continued for 15–20 minutes. When the door remained closed, the wife and her mother left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 3 July 2023, the husband brought the infant to a polyclinic for a medical appointment. He wheeled the infant in a stroller while the stepchildren accompanied them. While they waited to be served, the wife and her mother appeared. The wife spoke with the husband, but he ignored her and instead called the police for assistance. A commotion ensued, with the wife making physical contact with two of the stepchildren. The mother of the wife took the infant from the stroller and handed the infant to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Since 3 July 2023, the infant had been in the care of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The husband brought this application on behalf of all four children, alleging that the wife had placed them in fear of hurt. He alleged that the wife had, on 31 May 2023, placed the children in fear of hurt by hitting him and damaging the doorway to the flat in the presence of the children while the children and him had been in the flat. He added that the wife had, on 3 July 2023, hit the older children while attempting to remove the infant from his care. He thus sought PPOs to protect the children from the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The wife contended that she had been “wrongfully accused”. She stated that it was “not in [her] nature to cause, inflict or even consider hurt upon any especially not to [her] very own flesh and blood”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> She adduced statements of support from her mother and her sister. The former stated that “for a person who has had her child taken away from her for an extended period of time without her consent, [the wife] still managed to speak diplomatically to [the husband].”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The latter stated similarly that “for a person who has had her child taken away from her for an extended period of time without her consent, [the wife] still managed to speak in a calm and civilized manner to [the husband].”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The power of the court to grant a PPO is found in s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). It reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Protection order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.</b>—(1)    The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Two conditions must thus be proven on a balance of probabilities before a PPO may be granted. First, “family violence” must have been committed or must have been likely to be committed on a family member. Second, the PPO must be necessary for the protection of that family member (<em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<em>UNQ</em>”) at [23]–[24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for the definition of “family violence”, s 64 of the Charter provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Hence, physically abusing a family member will constitute family violence where hurt (defined in s 64 of the Charter as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”) was caused by an act that was known or ought to have been known would result in hurt. Also, acts that fall short of physical hurt but that are committed to place a family member in fear of hurt, or in an attempt to place the family member in fear of hurt, may constitute family violence if such acts are committed wilfully or knowingly (<em>UNQ</em> at [26]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For the incident on 31 May 2023, the wife had appeared at the flat of the husband uninvited, hit him when he opened the door thereto, reached in to push the door open when he had tried to close it, and did so in the view of the four children. These contentions were supported by a police report that he had filed on the same day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The only response offered by the wife was that she had approached the husband “cordially, but was treated with an unwelcome reception”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> But apparent from the contemporaneous video footage of the incident was instead the aggression of the wife, her mother, and her sister.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Similarly, a transcript produced by the wife of the exchange between them and the husband showed them issuing their demands and threatening to call the police for assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Indeed, the wife she had no basis to confront the husband at his flat on 31 May 2023. She had been fully aware that even if the husband had not complied with their arrangement on his access to the infant, her recourse lay at law and not in an extra-legal retrieval of the infant. In the letter of demand that she sent to the husband on 29 May 2023 (see [6] above), she threatened to “pursue <em>legal</em> remedies available to her to ensure the immediate return of the [infant] and seek appropriate <em>legal</em> action to protect [her] rights” [emphasis added]. Yet two days later (and merely hours after the deadline in that letter of demand for the husband to return the infant had expired), she attempted such an extra-legal retrieval. She assembled a posse of her relatives, appeared uninvited at the flat of the husband, and forced open his door when he had tried to close it. And she did these actions in the view of the children, who were in the flat, while blocking the doorway to the flat, which appeared to be their sole path of egress from the flat. With the spatial limits of the rental flat leaving little distance between her and the children, she must have known that these actions would likely place them in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The incident on 3 July 2023 was not stated by the husband in his Complaint, the process by which he commenced these proceedings, and raised by him only at trial. Nevertheless, the wife deposed to this incident in her evidence-in-chief<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and provided an account on the events that day. I did not therefore think that admitting the evidence on this incident would take her by surprise or otherwise occasion prejudice to her. I thus allowed the husband to lead evidence on this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The husband deposed that two of the stepchildren were hit by the wife at the polyclinic on 3 July 2023, when the wife appeared and tried to retrieve the infant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> All three stepchildren deposed to the same: that the wife had kicked one of them on the thigh and had pushed or slapped another on the hand.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In support of these contentions, the husband exhibited two sets of medical documents from Changi General Hospital. For the stepchild who had been kicked in the thigh, there was a diagnosis of a bruise on the thigh consistent with an “assault” and a prescription for two days of medical leave from 3 July 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> For the stepchild who had been pushed or slapped on the hand, there was a prescription for three days of medical leave from 3 July 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The wife initially maintained that the evidence of the stepchildren on the events of 3 July 2023 was “totally untrue”. But she subsequently suggested that any physical contact must have happened in the context of a “commotion” and amidst the “tension” that had transcended the interactions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> By this suggestion, therefore, the wife did not deny that she had kicked and pushed or slapped the stepchildren. Moreover, it was difficult to accept that this physical contact had been accidental. The kick had been delivered at the height of the “thigh” and with such force as to produce a bruise for which two days of medical leave was prescribed for its victim. And the push or slap had necessitated three days of medical leave for its victim. This incident thus involved at least the knowing causing of hurt to the two stepchildren who had been kicked and pushed or slapped, and the knowing placing in fear of hurt of all three stepchildren. The wife had thus perpetrated family violence on all of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Although the spouses were undergoing divorce proceedings, the stepchildren would likely have further contact with the wife. This was because of their close relationship with the infant, about whom the wife felt fiercely and whose extra-legal retrieval by the wife had precipitated the unfortunate events that are the subject of these proceedings. The difficulty that the wife had in regulating her emotions around the husband and the stepchildren had left the stepchildren at risk of further family violence. Their protection thus necessitated the granting a PPO in favour of each of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     For completeness, I did not think that a PPO was necessary for the protection of the infant. Any family violence by the wife on the infant had been purely tangential to that on the husband and the stepchildren. With the infant having been returned to the care of the wife since 3 July 2023, the risk of any family violence by the wife on the infant had abated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Still, given the closeness between the stepchildren and the infant, it would be in the best interests of the spouses, the stepchildren, and the infant to preserve a functional relationship between the stepchildren and the wife. To that end, I directed the husband, the wife, and the stepchildren to attending counselling with the Ministry of Social and Family Development with a view to improving this relationship. I also limited the duration of the PPOs in favour of the stepchildren to a year, in the hope that by the conclusion of the counselling, the formal orders for their protection would no longer be necessary.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>WAEIC21</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>WAEIC1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>WAEIC6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>WAEIC7</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>HAEIC11</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>WAEIC4</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See video taken by H on 31 May 2023</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>WAEIC4</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>WAEIC3</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>1NE3</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>3NE3, 5, 7</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>HAEIC17–18</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>HAEIC20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>3NE6</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Guardianship"],"date":"2024-02-16","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act) No 7 of 2023","title":"WTW v WTX","citation":"[2024] SGFC 9","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31070-SSP.xml","counsel":["Russell Thio (Emerald Law LLC) for the plaintiff","Carolyn Natalie Bava and Joshua Daniel Foo Zu Ian (Lee & Lee) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-03-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Patrick Tay Wei Sheng","html":"<root><head><title>WTW v WTX</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WTW <em>v</em> WTX </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31070-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 9</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Originating Summons (Guardianship of Infants Act) No 7 of 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">16 February 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Patrick Tay Wei Sheng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Russell Thio (Emerald Law LLC) for the plaintiff; Carolyn Natalie Bava and Joshua Daniel Foo Zu Ian (Lee &amp; Lee) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WTW — WTX </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Guardianship</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">16 February 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The mother of two young daughters passed away in 2018, shortly after the younger daughter was born. Rallying around their father to support them, the maternal grandmother took in and raised the younger daughter for two years while a paternal aunt provided daycare for the elder daughter until the elder daughter entered childcare. But the relationship between the father and the aunt soured after the father met a new partner who had since become his wife. Things came to a head on 22 May 2022, when the aunt frustrated the attempts of the father to retrieve his daughters after they had spent the day at her residence. Thereafter, the father stopped the interactions between his daughters and the aunt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The aunt subsequently filed multiple reports with public authorities including the police, the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and even the Prime Minister’s Office. Therein, she alleged that the father had ill-treated his daughters. In consequence, the Child Protective Service of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (the “CPS”) investigated the father and interviewed his daughters. At the conclusion of those investigations and interviews, the CPS found that the daughters were “functioning well” and that there was no basis to intervene in their care by the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Unhappy with these determinations of the CPS, the aunt commenced these proceedings. She applied to be made the joint guardian of the daughters, who are now seven and five years of age respectively. She also prayed for “access” to the daughters, and subsequently asked for the “care and control” of the daughters. She further sought the appointment of a child representative to assess the psychological state of the daughters while they had been in the care of the father. She claimed that she had been the “long-standing caregiver”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> of the daughters and that the father had ill-treated or been deficient in his care for them. She attributed this deficiency of the father to the “involvement” of his new wife in the lives of the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I found that the father had not ill-treated or been deficient in his care for his daughters. Instead, his daughters were functioning well in his care. Intervening in his parental authority and responsibility by making the aunt a joint guardian of his daughters would thus be unnecessary. Indeed, given the acrimony that had developed between the aunt and him, their joint exercise of such guardianship would have introduced needless volatility in the lives of the daughters. I thus dismissed the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The aunt has filed an appeal against this decision. I now provide my reasons for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Joint guardianship</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The power of the Family Court to appoint a guardian of a child to act jointly with his or her surviving father is found in s 6(2) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (the “GIA”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Rights of surviving parent as to guardianship</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>6.</b>—(1)    …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2) On the death of the mother of an infant, the father, if surviving, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be guardian of the infant, either alone or jointly with any guardian appointed by the mother. When no guardian has been appointed by the mother or if the guardian or guardians appointed by the mother is or are dead or refuses or refuse to act, the court may if it thinks fit appoint a guardian to act jointly with the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Hence, <em>prima facie</em>, a surviving father has the right to the custody of his children (<em>Re C (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0502.xml')\">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 502</a> (“<em>Re C</em>”) at [15]). Although the Family Court retains an overriding discretion to appoint an additional guardian to act jointly with the surviving father, this discretion will be exercised only if necessitated by the welfare of the child. Every exercise of this discretion entails an intrusion into the parental authority and responsibility of the surviving father. And the State will intervene in the parenting of children only as a last resort. The GIA should therefore not be interpreted as conferring upon the Family Court a general and broad discretion to appoint guardians (<em>VET v VEU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25033-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 4 SLR 1120</a> at [32]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On the evidence, the father had cared for his daughters ably. He had raised and housed them since their births, save for the two years after the passing of the mother during which the younger daughter had lived with the maternal grandmother. First with their mother and now with his new wife, he had provided his daughters a stable and secure family environment that conduced to their healthy development. As the CPS observed in a reply to the aunt on 10 July 2023, following repeated emails from her on the parenting of the father, the daughters were regular in their school attendance, participating in school activities, socialising well, and were in general functioning well.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Dear [Aunt]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We refer to your lawyer’s email to Child Protective Service (CPS) on 28 June 2023 and appeal to Prime Minister’s Office on 5 and 10 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">CPS interviewed your nieces [names redacted] on 29 May 2023 and assessed that they did not display any signs or symptoms of trauma or emotional distress. Their schools have also confirmed that the children have regular school attendance, they are able to participate in school activities and socialise well with their friends. They did not observe any behaviours indicative of emotional distress or child protection concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">CPS, the Family Justice Courts and FAM@FSC had spoken to you and explained to you that a psychological assessment on your nieces is no required at this juncture as they are observed to be functioning well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">CPS will not continue with its investigation any further. CPS encourages you to continue to cooperate with the counsellor from FAM@FSC (Fei Yue – Choa Chu Kang) who will work with you and your brother to support the well-being of your nieces. Unless there is new development of concern, CPS will not respond to further queries or appeals on this matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The aunt nevertheless claimed that the father was unable and unfit to parent the daughters. She raised a litany of allegations, but most of them were of limited relevanve. She alleged the father had “alienated himself from the paternal side of the family”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> “allowed his own father to seek financial assistance from comcare”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> “does not give his own mother regular allowance”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> “showed no appreciation and gratitude towards the [aunt] and the maternal grandmother in particular by cutting them off despite knowing that they loved and cared for the girls”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and “confused [the elder daughter] by enrolling [her] in CHIJ despite proclaiming himself to be a staunch Buddhist and raising the girls in a Buddhist household.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> She even extended this acrimony to the new wife of the father, speculating that the new wife had “forced the [father] to remove [his late wife’s] portraits in the matrimonial home”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and had envied her bringing of porridge for the daughters “because [the new wife] did not know how to cook for the girls”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Ultimately, these allegations reflected her disdain for the father and his new wife rather than a concern for the welfare of his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     A minority of the allegations appeared more relevant. But they still fell short of showing that the welfare of the daughters necessitated appointing the aunt as their joint guardian.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The aunt alleged that the father had on 22 May 2022 traumatised the daughters by assaulting her in front of them. But the sequence of events that evening is disputed. Further, any force had been used in the context of the aunt frustrating the efforts of the father to retrieve his daughters after they had spent the day at her residence. The aunt had no legal basis to so interfere in this parental authority of the father to so return his daughters to his care. Even if his reaction to that interference had been misguided, that reaction reflected little more than an innocuous desire to retrieve his daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The aunt alleged too that the father had made his daughters “sleep on double decker beds, which [the younger daughter] eventually fell off and hit her head”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and “refused to question why [the elder daughter] suffered 8 stitches on her chin after [the childcare centre] allowed such an injury to happen under their care”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> But these injuries were, even on the evidence of the aunt, the product of accidents. There was nothing inherently objectionable with the father having his daughters sleep on double decker beds or or of accepting that the injuries sustained by the daughter at childcare had been caused accidentally. His adoption of such a rugged parenting approach was well within the remit of his parental authority and responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The aunt alleged further that the father had prioritised his new wife’s pet dogs to his daughters,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> had left his daughters unkempt,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> had neglected to provide milk feeds to his daughters,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and had inflicted harsh punishment on his daughters that included pinching and punching them as well as locking them in the bathroom or outside the house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> But there was little evidence beyond the bare and self-serving assertions of the aunt that the father had left his daughters unkempt or had failed to attend to their needs. For the allegation of neglecting to feed the daughters, the father clarified that he had simply been following the advice of the daughters’ dentist. He explained that the dentist had advised that the teeth of the elder daughter were decaying, and that feeding her milk and other sugary foods would exacerbate that decay because sugar would pool around her teeth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He added that the dentist had also observed that the elder daughter, who had by then been five years of age, should not be feeding from a bottle.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> These explanations were eminently reasonable and I accepted them. And for the allegation of harsh physical punishment, the evidence did not show that he had punched or pinched the daughters. Although he had confined the elder daughter in a room and punished his daughters physically, he had done so judiciously and only after explaining to them the rationale for the correction. The allegations of the aunt about the parenting of the father could not therefore be sustained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notably, even before commencing these proceedings, the aunt had raised substantially the same allegations about the parenting of the father to the police, the CPS, and even the Prime Minister’s Office. Having investigated the father and interviewed the children, the CPS found no evidence of that the father had abused the daughters and declined to intervene in his parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Before me, the aunt did not dispute that the CPS had made such determinations. Yet she claimed that the father had conditioned the daughters to conceal their “psychological and mental trauma” during those investigations. But this was pure conjecture by the aunt. I did not think, even on a <em>prima facie</em> basis, that there was any issue with the parenting of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     For completeness, the aunt had requested the appointment of a child representative to assess the psychological state of the daughters while they had been in the care of the father. A child representative is a professional who is empowered to investigate and report on matters concerning the welfare of a child. But multiple public authorities had performed independent and objective investigations into the welfare of the daughters. These investigations had been conducted by forensic and allied professionals. And all these investigations had revealed no concerns about the welfare of the daughters and no basis to intervene in the parenting of the father. There was thus little utility in commissioning further investigations by a child representative. More crucially, the daughters had, over the past year alone, been subjected to multiple interviews about their welfare. It would hardly be in their welfare to subject them to further interviews with a child representative on the same subject.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In any event, even if the appointment of a joint guardian for the daughters was justified, it was unclear that the aunt should be appointed as that joint guardian. Her relationship with their father was fraught with acrimony. Inserting her into the sphere of the parental authority and responsibility of the father by compelling him to make decisions on the daughters jointly with her would introduce needless volatility in the lives of the daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I thus dismissed the application by the aunt to be appointed as an additional guardian to act jointly with the surviving father in matters concerning his daughters. Given this decision, there was no need for me to decide on the application by the aunt for the care and control of, or the access to, the daughters. Still, noteworthy was the evolution in the positions of the aunt on these matters. In her originating summons, she sought only “access” to the daughters. She confirmed the same in her supporting affidavit, in which she declared that “I have no intention of seeking custody, care and control of the Girls”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Yet she soon resiled from this declaration, stated that she “seeks … care and control of both [daughters]”, and offered scant explanation beyond a bare assertion that the father “does not seem to have any intention in changing the way he treats his daughters”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> for this evolution in her positions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The father sought costs of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements, for the hearing of this application. This sum was commensurate with the efforts through which he had been put for the hearing in responding to the multitude of allegations made against him. I awarded him the sum that he had sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In <em>CSW v CSX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29906-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 23</a>, a mother made repeated complaints about the parenting abilities of the father to the CPS and other public authorities in a bid to obtain for herself the care and control of the children. When those complaints produced no action by the public authorities against the father, the mother commenced judicial proceedings for similar relief in which she made similar allegations against the father. In rejecting the allegations of the mother, the Appellate Division of the High Court rebuked her for “involve[ing] the machinery of the state in essentially what was a parental disagreement” and lamented that her actions had produced anti-therapeutic consequences for the children (at [84]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Regrettably, this was precisely what had been done here by the aunt, who as a non-parent of the daughters had even less basis to disagree with the parenting decisions of their surviving father. She complained about the father to the police and the CPS, and when those complaints did not produce her desired result, sent an “appeal” to the Prime Minister’s Office. These complaints subjected the daughters to interviews and their father to investigations that eventually disclosed no basis to intervene in the parenting of the father. Rather than accept that the reality that the father was an able parent of his daughters, she commenced these proceedings, repeated her allegations against the father, and even speculated that the father and his daughters had misled the CPS in its investigations. So baseless were some of her allegations that they were struck out even before the substantive hearing of this application (with costs of $1,200 ordered against her).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The remainder of the allegations have now been heard on the merits and dismissed. It would be in the interests of herself and of the daughters, whom she professes to love, for her to begin respecting the parenting authority and responsibility of their father.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>P’s Subs at [4]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>P’s Subs at [6]–[7]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Aunt’s 5<sup>th</sup> Affidavit (dated 9 October 2023) at p 112</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 19</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 17</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 16</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Aunt’s Submissions at p 21</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit at [52]–[53]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit at [63]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit at [7]–[9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Aunt’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit at [5]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Aunt’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit at [5]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>FC/ORC xxx/2023</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2024-02-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No. 2245 of 2023","title":"WUC v WUD","citation":"[2024] SGFC 10","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31024-SSP.xml","counsel":["Imran H Khwaja, Thaddaeus Aaron Tan and Chow Hai Man (Tan Rajah & Cheah) for the complainant","Lee Weiming Andrew (PDLegal LLC) for the respondent"],"timestamp":"2024-02-29T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Zhi Xiang","html":"<root><head><title>WUC v WUD</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WUC <em>v</em> WUD </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31024-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 10</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The family relocated in Singapore in 2016. The Husband held an Employment Pass while the Wife and children (18 and 14) were dependents under the Husband’s Employment Pass. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Wife applied against the Husband for maintenance for herself and her two children. At the conclusion of the hearing, I held largely in favour of the Wife, as the Husband’s evidence was bare and largely unsupported. The Husband has since filed an appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties were represented by counsel, who consented to have the hearing proceed in chambers without oral testimony and cross-examination. I note with disapproval the Husband’s filing of the reply affidavit and written submissions the day before the trial (26 December 2023) at 11.36pm, long after they were both due – the reply affidavit was due on 6 December 2023, while the submissions were due on 18 December 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Court was not informed, nor was leave sought, to file the reply affidavit and submissions out of time. This was regrettable. The affidavit was also filed in the form of a solicitor’s cover affidavit. As of the date of these written Grounds, the Husband has not filed his affidavit in the proper form.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Further, the reply affidavit contained mostly bare assertions, spanning over just four pages of substantive text. This was despite his counsel seeking leave to file a reply affidavit at the mention on 16 November 2023 on the basis that he would like to respond to the allegations in the Wife’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Thus, the Wife’s evidence was largely met with unhelpful bare denials.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I now turn to and briefly summarise the Wife’s evidence. In 2021, the Wife received letters from the Husband’s solicitors on the topic of divorce. However, the Husband continued to provide for the family. From early 2022, the Husband started to meet with the family again and returned home every week.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In 2023, the Husband’s lawyers wrote to Wife again on the topic of divorce. He limited communication with his family thereafter. From July 2023, the Husband stopped providing for the family. In the same month, he wrote to the Wife, stating that his salary was cut to $18,000 a month and that they had to return to India. He also terminated the rental agreement of the apartment where the Wife and the children lived. The Wife signed a fresh tenancy agreement so that she could continue to stay in the same apartment. In addition, in an email to the Wife, he wrote that the Wife’s and the children’s passes will be cancelled.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband also wrote to the school of the younger child to withdraw him on the basis that the child will be moving back to India. Similarly, the Wife wrote to the school separately, and successfully had the son re-enrolled.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife exhibited various correspondence in support of her evidence. This was in contrast to the Husband’s bare reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary objection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I turn to a preliminary objection. The Husband stated for the first time in his reply affidavit filed one day before trial that the marriage was void, and that on this basis, the Court could not make an order for maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, at the time of the hearing, the Husband had not initiated nullity proceedings, nor did he tender any evidence in these proceedings that the marriage was void. On these grounds alone, the preliminary objection could not stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       For completeness, I address the submission that the Court could not in principle make an order for maintenance. Counsel for the Husband cited <em>ADP v ADQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/65246-M.xml')\">[2009] SGDC 489</a> in support of this submission. That decision was however reversed by the Court of Appeal in <em>ADP v ADQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0143.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 143</a> (“<em>ADP v ADQ</em>”), where the Court held that it had the power to order the division of assets and maintenance in void marriages under Part 10 of the Women’s Charter 1961. It was of concern that a decision which was reversed on appeal was cited to me, with no reference to the appellate Court’s decision. For completeness, I note that <em>ADP v ADQ</em> was not a case like the present one where a spouse sought maintenance under Part 8 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to address this point given that the Husband had not even begun to prove that the marriage was void.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance of the Wife and Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     A complainant must first prove that the respondent has neglected to provide reasonable maintenance. The Court will also assess the quantum for maintenance, considering factors at s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Further, Professor Leong Wai Kum has written in <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>, LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, 2018 at paragraphs 12.111 and 12.113:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The author suggests that the maintenance of a wife during marriage should be appreciated as the provision of emergency financial help so that the goal in assessing her maintenance must be to ensure that her basic needs are met to the extent which the husband is able to meet them. The same must be true of maintenance of a child by her parent… The relationships… between the child and her parent… are continuing. Intervention by the court into such continuing relationships should be as minimally invasive as possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Such reported cases as there are demonstrate that the amounts ordered tend to be fairly modest. The courts use the law of maintenance to order the defendant to meet the child’s modest needs to the extent that she can…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     At the same time, the standard of living is relevant when the Court determines maintenance: s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Thus, what amounts to “basic needs” differs according to the standard of living of each family. The maintenance ordered does not need to be limited to basic sustenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Importantly, the Courts adopt a “budget” approach on a broad-brush basis when assessing maintenance: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10], [30] and [31]. This is not an exercise in checking off receipts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Neglect</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife’s evidence that he had not paid maintenance since July 2023 was not disputed by the Husband. The Husband wrote in his reply affidavit:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">my change in circumstances since (i.e. a reduction in my fixed monthly salary) plus additional necessary expenses of rent, utilities, personal expenses, credit card repayments and taxes (as set out in pages 13 to 16 of my Respondent’s Bundle of Documents) do not allow me to continue maintaining the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As I had found that the Husband’s change in circumstances was self-induced (see immediately below), I found that the Husband had neglected to provide maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s income and earning capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     A key plank in the Husband’s case, apparent from above, was that he could no longer afford to pay maintenance because his income had been reduced to about $18,000 a month. His income tax Notices of Assessment of 2021 and 2022 stated that his annual income exceeded $1 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> However, no explanation was given at all as to why there was such a drastic drop in his income. The Wife’s undisputed evidence was that the Husband had deliberately changed employers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> At the hearing, his counsel confirmed that he had no instructions and that it was a “personal decision”. Since the Husband had not explained why he had chosen to take such a large pay-cut, I found that the reduction in income was self-induced. Thus, in determining reasonable maintenance, I took into account his previous salary. Indeed, a paying party’s earning capacity is relevant, as stated at s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s income and earning capacity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I also did not consider it reasonable for the Husband to expect the Wife to return to the job market quickly after being a housewife from 2005. His submission that the Wife was living off him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> was a plain attempt at minimising her non-financial contributions to the family, which the Courts have time and again disapproved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assessment of quantum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In assessing maintenance, I declined to consider the Husband’s proposal that the Wife and children move back to India. His case was that parties should move back to India because of his reduced earnings. Given that I had found that his reduction in income (even if true) was self-induced, I could not accept this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Counsel for the Wife confirmed that her client’s final lists of expenses were set out in her written submissions. She sought $9,900 for herself (including $3,600 for renting the apartment), $9,200 for her elder child (including $5,042 in school fees) and $11,500 for her younger child (including $5,800 in school fees), as well as specific reimbursement for expenses incurred for the family dog and for monies borrowed to meet expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Considering the principles set out above at [10] to [12] above, I found that the list of expenses the Wife had set out in her written submissions to be on the high side. For instance, $1,500 on grooming and spa and $750 on entertainment a month could not be said to be a sum that is necessarily to fulfil her basic needs. Similarly, it was not easy to see why it would be necessary for teenagers to spend about $1,000 each on clothing, personal grooming and entertainment, especially when a separate sum of $667 each had been set aside for dining out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In calculating maintenance, I also split the monthly rent of $3,600 between the Wife and the two children, as that reflected the sum each needed more accurately, given that they all stayed in the same household. I also took the view that it would be preferable for the school-related fees and expenses of the children to be borne on an ad-hoc basis, especially as the elder-daughter’s university arrangements appeared to be fluid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As stated at [12] above, a broad-brush approach would be appropriate. I also note that the Husband did not dispute each specific expense listed by the Wife, but made the broad point that he could not afford to pay because of his alleged reduced earnings. Hence, I do not propose to list down each specific expense. Bearing in mind everything above, including $1,200 each for rent, and applying a broad-brush approach, I ordered the Husband the pay the Wife monthly maintenance of $5,700 for herself and $4,200 each for the two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition, I ordered the Husband to pay:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     any school fees, tuition fees, fees associated with enrichment classes and co-curricular activities for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     one set of return economy class tickets to Canada annually on a full-service airline when the daughter starts school in Canada.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the son’s outstanding school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As alluded above, since many of the above expenses were ad-hoc, it would be more reasonable for the Husband to pay them as they were incurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I also backdated maintenance to July 2023 as the Husband did not dispute that he had failed to pay maintenance since July 2023. I did not think that the maintenance ordered, including backdated maintenance, was unreasonable given the Husband’s earning capacity. I did not provide separately for the Wife’s debts incurred for the purposes of providing for herself and the children, as I had already ordered backdated maintenance, and doing so would involve double-counting. I also did not provide separately for expenses relating to the family’s late pet dog, as the sum for backdated maintenance was already rather substantial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I ordered costs at $3,000 to be paid by the Husband to the Wife. This was on the low side given the Court attendances, affidavits and submissions filed, and the fact that the Wife was substantially granted what she had sought. Given the Husband’s conduct, especially his late filing of the reply affidavit and submissions, I was prepared to grant more.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s AEIC at paras 5 to 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 9 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Minute sheet of the mention on 16 November 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Ibid.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 17 and 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 33 to 46.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Ibid at paras 47 to 49.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s reply affidavit at paras 5 to 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s reply affidavit at para 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s bundle of documents at pp 22 and 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s reply affidavit at para 5.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Wife’s written submissions at para 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Wife’s written submissions at paras 38 to 44.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Contested Divorce - Adultery - Unreasonable behaviour - Section 95(3)(a) & (b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)"],"date":"2024-02-15","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No 3942 of 2022","title":"WUK v WUL and another","citation":"[2024] SGFC 12","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F31076-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Tan Siew Khim & Mr Koh Zhen Yang (Sterling Law Corporation) - for the Plaintiff","Mr Cha Yong Sing Ignatious / Ms Yeo Qi Yan Pearlyn (Yeo & Associates) - for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-02-26T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Cheryl Koh","html":"<root><head><title>WUK v WUL and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WUK <em>v</em> WUL and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31076-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 12</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Husband sought for the marriage to be dissolved on his counterclaim of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 9 November 2023, I dissolved the marriage based on the Wife’s claim of the Husband’s adultery and dismissed the Husband’s counterclaim of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour. I also made no orders on the Wife’s claim of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. On 15 November 2023, the Husband appealed against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The issues that arise in the case are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>a.     whether the Wife has proven that the Husband had committed adultery and the Wife found it intolerable to live with him; and/or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>b.     whether the Wife has proven that the Husband had behaved in such a way that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>c.     whether the Husband has proven that the Wife had behaved in such a way that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In this case, it is not disputed that by April 2022, the Husband had emotionally checked out of the marriage, signed up for a dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, started dating the co-Defendant Ms. D, and initiated separation with the Wife. However, did the Husband commit adultery with Ms. D during the instances captured by the Wife’s private investigator? Was it the Wife who had behaved such that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her leading him to start his affair with Ms. D, or was it the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour that had caused the breakdown of marriage?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">B.   Background facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties were married in Hong Kong on 8 February 2003. Interim Judgment was granted herein on 9 November 2023. This is hence a marriage of about 21 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are three (3) children in the marriage: one biological child to the marriage, a daughter named “A” born in 2006 and currently about 17 years old studying in Singapore. The Wife also has 2 daughters of a previous marriage: (a) “B” aged around 30 years old and currently living in Europe; and (b) “C” aged around 25 years old and currently living in the United Kingdom. The Husband became a stepfather to B and C after this marriage. Since 2001, parties had co-habitated and B and C (who were then aged 8 years and 3 years respectively) lived with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband is 50 years old and a British citizen. He is employed as the head of growth in a Japanese global advertising agency. He is the sole breadwinner of the family and earned around $34,000.00 per month or close to half a million dollars per year. The Wife is 62 years old and a Hong Kong citizen. She is and has been a homemaker at all material times. Both parties are Singapore permanent residents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The co-Defendant to the Wife’s claim of adultery is Ms. D, who is a local Chinese aged around 43 years old. She met the Husband through a dating app, Coffee Meets Bagel. She neither entered appearance nor appeared as a witness in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Parties lived in Hong Kong until around 2016 when the Husband was retrenched and parties moved to Phuket, Thailand. In or around 2017, the Husband joined a start-up founded in Singapore and travelled to Singapore for work from Mondays to Thursdays. In or around 2019, parties moved to Singapore. In or around September 2020, the Husband became employed by his present employer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Events leading to the present proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s case was that parties always had a loving marriage and even celebrated Christmas 2021, her birthday on 31 January 2022 and their wedding anniversary on 8 February 2022. Whilst parties had disagreements throughout the marriage, these were not major and were resolved. However, since March 2022, the Husband had a drastic change in behaviour towards the Wife: (a) he started to verbally attack her by finding fault with her - he complained whenever he saw her rest and looked at her laptop, claimed she did not perform household chores to his expectations and accused her of spending unreasonably; (b) he began to take pains in his dressing and bought a new wardrobe, started to keep late nights and became secretive about who he was with; (c) he began to engineer a separation between parties and on 10 May 2022, informed the Wife that he wanted to live separately. He gaslighted her by concocting incidents and blamed her for causing him unhappiness; and (d) he also became penny pinching and calculative towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was around this time on 18 May 2022 that the Wife discovered intimate WhatsApp chats between the Husband and the co-Defendant, Ms. D. On 27 May 2022, the Wife engaged a private investigator, a Mr. E, to conduct surveillance on the Husband. The Wife’s private investigator produced evidence of the Husband behaving intimately with Ms. D on various occasions between 27 May 2022 and 2 July 2022, including kissing, hugging and caressing each other in public, staying in Ms. D’s condominium residence for many hours and spending a 3-day 2-night staycation in [S] hotel. It then made sense to the Wife why the Husband had started to find fault with her at every turn and wanted out of the marriage - his intention was to pursue his newfound love interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In June 2022, the Husband arranged for parties to move out into separate apartments. The Wife eventually moved into her new rented apartment with parties’ daughter, A, in August 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband’s case was that the marriage had been full of lies, deceit and anger from the Wife. He was initially working hard not to let arguments escalate but on 8 March 2022, the Wife took umbrage at a work initiative asking for pictures and videos of husbands and male partners doing housework, and did not speak to him for two (2) weeks. At the end of March 2022, the Wife informed him that unless he changed, she would move to Taiwan in two (2) years after their daughter, A, finished high school and he could do whatever he wanted. The Husband felt the Wife was ending the marriage, and he decided to reinvent himself and socialize with more people. He signed up to a dating app, Coffee Meets Bagel, to meet new people. He then met the co-Defendant, Ms. D, on the app. He however denied that he had sexual intercourse with Ms. D. In fact, Ms. D told him she did not wish to have sex with any future partners prior to marriage. He and Ms. D had gone on a staycation to [S] hotel from 30 June to 2 July 2022 as he had already told the Wife more than six (6) weeks prior (i.e., on 10 May 2022) that the marriage was over.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The present proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On 27 August 2022, the Wife filed for divorce based on the Husband’s adultery and/or unreasonable behaviour. On 21 September 2022, the Husband filed a counterclaim based on the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Parties filed the following pleadings and affidavits of evidence in chief (“<b>AEIC</b>”) herein:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>a.     the Wife’s Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>b.     the Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>c.     the Wife’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>d.     the Husband’s Reply to Defence to Counterclaim;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>e.     the Husband’s AEIC;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>f.     the affidavit of the Husband’s transcriber containing the certified transcript of parties’ conversation on 10 May 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>g.     the Wife’s AEIC; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_h\"></a>h.     the AEIC of the Wife’s private investigator, Mr. E.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The trial of the contested divorce proceedings was heard before me on 19 July 2023 (half day), 5 September 2023 (full day) and 6 September 2023 (half day). During the trial, the Wife had two (2) witnesses, namely, herself and her private investigator, Mr. E. The Husband was his only witness. As stated, the co-Defendant Ms. D neither entered appearance nor appeared as a witness in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summary of parties’ cases </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife case is that the Husband’s adultery with the co-Defendant, Ms. D, as set out in [12] herein and/or unreasonable behaviour as set out in [11] herein had caused the breakdown of marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Husband denied he had committed adultery or behaved unreasonably.

Section 95(6) considered whether the plaintiff had lived with the defendant for a period of 6 months or more after the last incident complained of, for the purpose of determining whether the plaintiff could reasonably be expected to live with the defendant. In <em>VBZ v VCA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23764-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 119</a>, the court discussed the application of this provision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“15     <b><em>… According to the husband, he reconciled with the wife and parties then stayed together as a family from June 2017.

In that case, the plaintiff relied on incidents and events which allegedly supported his claim of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour over wide ranging periods of time. However</em>, <b><em>in that case, after a particular period of incidents and events, the plaintiff ‘forgave’ the defendant the conduct complained of and reconciled with her. </em></b><em>Whilst there is no similar reference to the concept of condonation as set out in Section 95(3)(a), the effect was the same.

This is not disputed by the Wife. In my judgment however, and as discussed in [23] herein, adultery is rarely proven by direct evidence and is usually a matter of inference and circumstance. Mr. E explained that in order for him to obtain a private investigator licence, he had to attend a training course by the Singapore police on how to collect evidence of adultery: when the subjects were at a public place, he could obtain intimate shots of them (a) holding hands, hugging or kissing, (b) of them proceeding to a private place (e.g., a house or a hotel), and (c) of them remaining at the private place for a period of time. However, he could not attempt to enter the private place to obtain shots of them doing sexual acts as that would amount to trespass<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. As such, it is unsurprising that Mr. E could not enter Ms. D’s residence or their hotel room in [S] to obtain actual evidence of sexual intercourse between the Husband and Ms. D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Instead, the test for adultery is whether it can be shown by documentary evidence or antecedent conduct that the association of the parties was intimate and their mutual passion clear such that adultery might reasonably be assumed by the court as the result of an opportunity for its occurrence: see [23] herein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In this case, I find that adultery is reasonably assumed as the result of several opportunities for its occurrence, based on the following evidence. <em>First</em>, it is not disputed that by April 2022, the Husband had signed up on the dating app, Coffee Meets Bagel. His evidence is that he texted Ms. D on WhatsApp on 5 April 2022 (which meant that he was chatting with her on the app before that), had a video call with her on 8 April 2022 and met her in person on 18 April 2022. Under cross-examination, he admitted that by 19 May 2022, he had met Ms. D quite a few times and was messaging her a lot. He accepted his messages to her were flirty and cheeky, he found her physically attractive<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, he was trying to build a romantic relationship with her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, and that had in fact kissed her by then<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>I wish we were having this conversation over table in person looking at each other.

I was going to remind you 5.30 tomorrow at Natureland</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>Looking forward to watching you sleep for 45mins tomorrow” “Night night Princess Peace!”</em>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">She texted “<em>shower in 8mins</em>” to which he responded “<em>Nice. Am I allowed to imagine that too? Slap me down if you need.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>In my judgment, the Wife has shown that by May 2022, the Husband had formed a romantic relationship with Ms. D that went beyond mere friendship, and which formed the foundation for their improper association and commission of adultery as discussed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>Second</em>, after the Wife discovered the Husband’s WhatsApp messages to Ms. D on 18 May 2022, she hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on the Husband.

The Husband accepted that he and Ms. D were the persons captured in the private investigator’s evidence.

He referred to a WhatsApp message from Ms. D to him on 11 May 2022 stating that she had promised God she would abstain from sex until marriage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In my judgment, it is clear from the above evidence in [32] and [33] herein that the Husband’s conduct with Ms. D was so intimate and passionate that it may reasonably be inferred that the Husband had committed adultery with Ms. D when the six above-stated opportunities in [34] arose for its occurrence. They were in a romantic relationship where the Husband found Ms. D physically attractive. They partook in couple activities together such as going for a hotel staycation, going to the spa, going dancing, and having all their meals together during the staycation. In public places like restaurants, public roads, a public park and a hotel swimming pool, they engaged in acts of necking and petting like kissing, hugging, caressing and stroking each other, wrapping their arms around each other, pressing their bodies against each other and making movements up and down; they could not keep their mouths and hands off each other and their public displays of affection and passion were ardent and evident. When alone in private places like in Ms. D’s residence and the hotel room in [S], it may thus be reasonably inferred that they would culminate their passion and engage in even more physically intimate acts including sexual intercourse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     While the Husband relied on Ms. D’s pronouncement of sex abstinence before marriage, Ms. D was not called as a witness to testify on the vow and whether she had kept to it in these proceedings. In the same message, she referred to making the decision a mere week prior and was still figuring it out; hence, that message was not reliable to prove that they did not engage in sexual intercourse several weeks later in June 2022. Even if I gave the Husband the benefit of the doubt and found that their impassioned acts of kissing and hugging in public might not necessarily translate into sexual intercourse in private during the first five opportunities on 10, 11 and 30 June and 1 July 2022, it is not possible to make such a finding for the sixth opportunity on 1 July 2022. This is because I place significant weight on the Husband’s and Ms. D’s bold acts of engaging in erotic frolic and foreplay in the hotel swimming pool on 1 July 2022 for around two (2) hours, where (a) Ms. D wrapped her legs around the Husband’s neck and put her feet on his shoulders; (b) the Husband moved up and down or towards and away against Ms. D in a repeated and rhythmic manner; (c) Ms. D sat on the Husband’s lap and moved up and down against him in a repeated and rhythmic manner; and (d) after engaging in these movements, they headed up to their hotel room. Such up and down or towards and away repeated and rhythmic movements of their bodies were suggestive of the act of sexual intercourse, and demonstrated a strong propensity or inclination towards copulation. When they headed to the hotel room, they had the immediate opportunity to translate these movements into actual copulation movements. While the Husband said he was floating with his legs behind him during these movements against Ms. D in the pool, it was very odd that he would float in such a suggestive and erotic manner. In my view, the intensity of their sexual desire and tension was so palpable that it must lead to the reasonable inference that they had translated these sexual movements in the swimming pool into copulation movements when they were alone in their hotel room. The Husband is not able to discharge any evidential burden that he did not in fact have sexual intercourse that night.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It must be borne in mind that the Wife’s burden of proof is one of a balance of probabilities in a civil case, and not beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal case. She did not need to prove the act of sexual intercourse had <b>without a reasonable doubt</b> taken place, for instance, by having the private investigator obtain photographic/videographic recordings of the Husband and Ms. D in the act, or obtaining written/oral confessions of the act. In other words, she only needed to persuade the court that <b>more likely than not</b>, adultery had taken place. In family cases, the oft-relied upon evidence for adultery is circumstantial evidence such as the private investigator’s report capturing the adulterous pair’s public displays of affection and passion, together with the private opportunities for consummation of their passion. To require anything more (such as the private investigator to enter private places to catch the pair in the act) would transgress the boundaries of law. In this case, the private investigator had managed to capture the Husband and Ms. D engaging in several acts of intimacy and passion, including up and down sexual movements in the hotel swimming pool on 1 July 2022, which must lead to the reasonable inference that they had, <b>more likely than not (and not most likely, most definitely or most conclusively)</b>, translated these movements into actual copulation movements when they went up to their hotel room. In these circumstances, I find that the Wife has discharged her burden of proof of adultery on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As I have allowed the Wife’s claim on the Husband’s adultery, I did not find it necessary to examine her claim of his unreasonable behaviour and made no orders on the same. I would only observe that it is undisputed that by April 2022, the Husband had emotionally checked out of the marriage, signed up for a dating app, started to date Ms. D and proceeded to engineer separation between parties. I also add that given Mr. E’s private investigation report, it cannot be challenged that the Husband is guilty of unreasonable behaviour by virtue of improper association with Ms. D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Issue 2: Whether the Wife had behaved such that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The next issue that arises is whether the Wife had behaved such that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her. Specifically, whether it was the Wife’s behaviour that had caused the Husband to emotionally check out of the marriage and start to date Ms. D. In my judgment, I do not find that the Husband has proven this to be the case on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Lack of particulars of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As a preliminary point, I find that the Husband had not pleaded sufficient particulars of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour in his Counterclaim for her to answer to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Each type of unreasonable behaviour should be pleaded, together with the date, time and a brief nature of that type of unreasonable behaviour: see [26] herein. In this case, the Husband set out the particulars of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour in paragraphs 23 to 32 of his Counterclaim. The Husband made bare allegations that the Wife neglected him, yelled at him, gave him silent treatment, was disrespectful, and treated him as an ATM machine. No details are provided on the dates, times and description of each type of behaviour on the part of the Wife. He only raised one incident on 8 March 2022 in paragraph 25 therein where the Wife had allegedly taken umbrage at a work initiative on taking pictures and videos of husbands and male partners doing housework. This incident will be discussed below which I did not find constituted unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife. Nonetheless, even if this incident was proven, in my judgment, the particulars were still bare and insufficient for the Wife to answer to. The Husband did raise two (2) other incidents in his Reply to the Statement of Particulars, which was an incident at the end of March 2022 where the Wife had threatened to move to Taiwan<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and an incident relating to him paying for the Wife’s travels between September to November 2021 to Europe and June to July 2022 to Hong Kong. Even then, these incidents relate to September 2021 onwards and do not particularize exactly how the Wife had behaved unreasonably towards him earlier. It is only in his AEIC that the Husband provided details relating to earlier incidents. The Wife’s counsel thus chose not to cross-examine the Husband on most of his allegations of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour, and instead submitted that his claim ought to be dismissed for lack of sufficient particulars. I find that on the basis of the pleadings alone, the Wife has no case to answer. Notwithstanding this, for completeness, I shall proceed to examine the Husband’s allegations to determine if the Wife had behaved such that he could not reasonably be expected to live with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Whether the Husband could reasonably be expected to live with the Wife</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As a further preliminary point, I considered the Wife’s submission that any incidents of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour raised by the Husband prior to December 2021 ought to be given little weight for the purpose of determining whether the Husband could reasonably be expected to live with the Wife. This is because the Husband had expressly reconciled with the Wife and evinced an intention to work on the marriage in December 2021. I found this submission to be of some merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In <em>VBZ v VCA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23764-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 119</a> (and as further explained in <em>VRN v VRO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26061-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 54</a>) referred to in [27] and [28] herein, the court took into consideration that the husband had forgiven the wife and reconciled with her in June 2017, and stayed on in the marriage until he moved out in July 2018. The court held that the husband could not say that he could not live with the wife by relying on past incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this case, the Husband likewise sent a message to the Wife on 3 December 2021 containing a “love letter” taking the blame for disagreements in their marriage and resolving to reconcile with the Wife and salvage the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>a.     he reiterated why he fell in love with her: “<em>I fell in love with you the first day I met you. You took my breath away. You made my heart jump. I had never felt that before. And at the time I should not felt that! The sight of you, your presence, your smell, everything about you. It was your aura, your personality, and your independence, Strong, and bold and you took no shit. And yes you were and are beautiful both inside and out. Loving you was easy</em>…”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>b.     took blame for much of their disagreements: “<em>We have been through a lot. A lot of good times but a lot of hard and challenging moments too. We have never shield away from disagreeing. I have always been 100% dedicated and focused to all that was our life, and the life of the girls, but I have not always been a good partner for you. My patience has been short, and we have not always seen eye to eye on many things. The last few years have been really hard. But I take the blame for much of that</em>”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_c\"></a>c.     professed his love and made a commitment towards the Wife and the marriage: “<em>From today, I make a commitment to you. A commitment to listen. A commitment to be patient. A commitment to discuss and try to understand. A commitment to continue to love you unconditionally. As I always have. But we may still not always agree. That does not matter. As long as we both understand that. We will work through it all. We will discuss, we will disagree. But we will be together, and we will find a solution to everything. Why? Because I truly and deeply love you. And always will. Do not ever forget that</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Under cross-examination, the Husband admitted that he was at the time committed to make the marriage work<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. It is hence clear that as of December 2021, he did not find it intolerable to continue to live with the Wife; by an extension, any incidents of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour raised by the Husband prior to December 2021 ought to be viewed with a lens of circumspection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Allegation that the Wife had a bad temper, subjected the Husband to lies, deceit and anger and refused to acknowledge his contributions to household chores</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I do not find that the Husband has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife had a bad temper and was full of lies, deceit and anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Wife’s evidence was that the marriage was largely a happy and loving one, as reflected in the numerous photographs of parties and their children, and the Husband’s handwritten cards and loving messages to the Wife over the years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. The parties also enjoyed many celebrations with their family and friends over the years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. As late as 8 February 2022, parties celebrated their wedding anniversary in Sentosa and took a photo side by side smiling<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. The Husband admitted under cross-examination that he had even bought a painting from an artist as a gift for the Wife in February 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Wife’s position is that while parties had disagreements throughout the marriage like all couples do, they were not major and were resolved. However, after the Husband had moved to Singapore and became employed by his present employer with a good salary, he began to drink a lot and she produced photographs of him being passed out on the floor or table at home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. By March 2022, he was keeping late nights from work, being secretive about who he was with, becoming conscious of his appearance by buying a new wardrobe, and finding fault with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Husband relied on some other incidents - for example, he pleaded that he had witnesses who said that the Wife was rude and angry in Phuket<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>; however, no such witnesses were produced in these proceedings. He said she berated the yacht owners for running out of champagne at his 40<sup>th</sup> birthday party some 10 years ago, which she denied<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Ultimately, I find that there is no evidence that parties’ disagreements were caused by the Wife unreasonably:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>a.     as early as in 2011, the Husband took the blame for their disagreements due to his work stress. He apologized in his email to the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“I was tired, in pain and generally not in a good mood, as I was getting ready for two difficult calls. But that is not an excuse. I was simply tied up in my own issues and did not think about you and your day and what you were doing. I am sorry for that - deeply sorry”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“We are two very strong-willed people and when we argue neither of us appears to want to back down or admit we are wrong. And that is why we find ourselves where we are today, and why over the last few years we have got to this situation more than once before. We always argue over the negatives and not often enough celebrate the wonderful things we have as a couple and as a family. And for that I am sorry….”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>b.     in 2020, the Husband admitted that he was the one who was short-tempered with her due to work stress<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“Things are hard with work for me… and financially we are in a tough place. I made some wrong decisions and trying to get back on top of it now. It’s making my temper short because I am just thinking about so many things.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>c.     in 2021, the Husband again admitted he was short-tempered with her due to work stress:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“<em>My patience has been short, and we have not always seen eye to eye on many things. The last few years have been really hard. But I take the blame for much of that</em>”; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>d.     under cross examination, he admitted that he was the one who was short-tempered with the Wife on many occasions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is hence clear that it was the Husband himself who was short-tempered with the Wife throughout the marriage. Even if the Wife was also bad tempered, I did not see how having a bad temper by itself without more could constitute unreasonable behaviour; otherwise, our courts would have to grant divorces based on the lack of a pleasant temperament or disposition on the part of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As for the Husband’s allegation that the Wife refused to acknowledge his contributions to the household chores, he relied on an incident in March 2022. He alleged that the Wife had taken umbrage about a work initiative of taking photos and videos of husbands and male partners doing housework. The Wife’s evidence was she responded jokingly “<em>then where was I when you did all this</em>”, which had upset him as he felt that he did also contribute towards the household chores. The conversation became heated and she retreated into her bedroom to keep the peace. In my view, this amounted to a one off and minor dispute over household chores - each of them felt that the other did not appreciate their efforts towards the household chores, and it did not by itself prove that the Wife had contumeliously and unreasonably refused to acknowledge the Husband’s housework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Ultimately, particulars of unreasonable behaviour when taken together must amount to more than a complaint that the parties are incompatible or cannot communicate: see [25(c)] herein. By an extension of this logic, I would add that they should also amount to more than mere disagreements, disputes or differences in opinions/views between spouses; otherwise, it would lead to an opening of floodgates for divorces based on spouses being unable to get along in a marriage. Marriage involves compromise and give and take; a spouse cannot have his/her own way all the time and ultimately, significant decisions have to be taken for the joint benefit of the family, particularly the children. In this case, parties sometimes had differing views on certain issues: for instance, the Husband complained that he was pressured into agreeing for the Wife and A to move from Phuket to Singapore in 2019 as it was expensive in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>, but the Wife explained it was a joint decision made for the welfare of A to have a better education in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. In my view, the Husband as the sole financial provider could in fact call the shots on whether to move the family or not, but he ultimately did so for the sake of A. Such differences in opinion, however, did not in my view translate to unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Allegation that the Wife made threats against him and did not trust him</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     As for the Husband’s allegation that the Wife had made threats against him and did not trust him, he relied on an incident at the end of March 2022 where the Wife said that if he did not change, she would go to Taiwan and he could do whatever he wanted. He produced an audio recording of their conversation on 10 May 2022 to prove that the Wife had made such a threat. In my view, significant weight cannot be placed on this recording: on 10 May 2022 after he had already started dating Ms. D, he started to record this conversation, raising purported issues he had with the marriage as far back as 5 to 10 years ago, tried to obtain concessions from her and initiated separation into two separate apartments. In any event, it is not clear from the transcript that the Wife admitted making such a threat: she said in one part that she did not remember saying that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In her email to him dated 15 May 2022 in response to his email of 13 May 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>, she also said she did not remember her exact wording and probably that was what she said; but this email was written when she was in shock after his initiation of separation. She clarified in her subsequent email dated 30 May 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> that she had made apologies and taken responsibility because she was essentially pleading with him to stay. It is also in her evidence that she did want to travel to see her brothers in Taiwan after A left Singapore for university in the United Kingdom<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Allegation that the Wife was a spendthrift and financially irresponsible</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I was also not persuaded that the Husband has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife was a spendthrift or financially irresponsible:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>a.     the Husband has not produced any bank or credit card statements to prove exactly how much the Wife had allegedly overspent each month. He was the sole breadwinner of the family: he provided her with a cash allowance (at $3,000.00 per month), paid her credit card bills and paid all expenses of the family<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>. He was in complete financial control, and there is no evidence that he had ever told her to cut her spending, tried to reduce her cash allowance or curb her credit card limit;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>b.     in the audio transcript on 10 May 2022, he referred to the Wife’s expenditure as “<em>little bit here and on clothes. Bits you buy on Lazada, that aren’t food , aren’t things for the house</em>”, “<em>the little things you buy on Lazada, the wasteful things you buy</em>”, “<em>things for the cat</em>”, “<em>a screen for the Christmas tree</em>” and “<em>useless pieces of plastic</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. In my view, purchase of these small items on Lazada, without more details or evidence of the price or volume of such purchases, did not substantiate his allegation that the Wife was a spendthrift. The Husband earned close to half a million dollars per year, and it was not financially unreasonable for the Wife to do online shopping on Lazada;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>c.     the Wife’s evidence was that she was always careful to spend within their means and did not any buy any jewellery or designer items. She bought basic clothes from H&amp;M and Zara, and only had a Gucci bag and a few Tods bags gifted by the Husband over several birthdays<em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></em>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>d.     in my view, the Husband has not shown that the Wife was behaving unreasonably in doing some online shopping, when in fact he had absolute financial control of the purse strings as the sole breadwinner (and could determine how much she could or could not spend) and earned some $34,000.00 per month (which would allow the family to enjoy a certain level of spending).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband further alleged that on top of solely maintaining the child of the marriage, A, he also had to solely maintain the Wife’s daughters from her previous marriage, B and C. In my judgment, I did not see how the Husband’s maintenance of A and his step-children, whom he accepted as children of the family, meant that the Wife had behaved unreasonably:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_55-p2_a\"></a>a.     when the Husband started co-habitating with the Wife in 2001, B was only 8 years old and C was only 2 years old. The Husband began to cover rental and food as monies from her then estranged husband was infrequent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_55-p2_b\"></a>b.     in his email to the Wife dated 20 December 2002 before parties were married, the Husband accepted that the Wife did not work:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“</em> <b><em>While it would make things more secure for all of us if you are working this really does not bother me</em></b> <em>.

In fact, the Husband had not produced any evidence of him asking her to go out to work and her refusing to do so. As such, I did not see how the Husband could now blame the Wife for being a homemaker in their twenty (21) year marriage and not paying for A, B and C. In fact, he could easily relocate with the family from Hong Kong to Phuket in 2016 and then Phuket to Singapore in 2019 for his career because the Wife was a homemaker without a job tying her down to a particular location.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Husband further complained that the Wife did not enforce maintenance for B and C against her ex-husband save for one legal letter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. However:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>a.     it is clear from her email of 13 July 2006 to her ex-husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> that she had made repeated requests for maintenance arrears against him:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“<em>My lawyer is preparing the necessary document this week.

Why should he? Your saying that we didn't compromise to your suggestion on paying $10K.

There is also no evidence of him seeking legal advice on whether he himself could recover monies expended on B and C against their biological father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>d.     the Husband further complained that the Wife had sent her ex-husband monies in 2012 to 2013<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> but he has not offered details on how much these transfers were or produced evidence of the same. From the transcript of conversation recorded between parties on 10 May 2022, the Husband referred to two transfers of HKD5,000.00 (less than S$1,000.00). He accepted that the ex-husband had no money and was in trouble<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>. He also referred to the fact that the ex-husband had then stayed with them for Christmas<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>, which suggested that their relationship with him was not so acrimonious;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e\"></a>e.     B had in fact gone to live with her biological father and his new wife for a period of time in Bali, hence he did play a part in taking care of her expenses when she was living with him in Bali; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_f\"></a>f.     in my view, the Husband has not proven that the Wife had unreasonably refused to enforce maintenance against her ex-husband for B and C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57.    The Husband further complained that he had to pay for B’s expenses when she was already in fact 30 years old, including paying for the Wife’s trip to Europe to see B from 27 September to 12 November 2021. I was also unable to accept how this constituted unreasonable behaviour on the Wife’s part:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>a.     B is someone whom the Husband had been a step-parent to since she was about 8 years old. Parties struggled with her upbringing over the years: at one point she went to live with her father in Bali, then fell out with her father and lived on her own in Bali, and eventually moved to Europe. She was also diagnosed with bipolar condition and depression. To pin the blame on the Wife for B coming to this state and not being financially independent at the age of 30 years would be most unfortunate;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>b.     the Wife’s evidence was that B had been drugged and raped in Amsterdam in 2021 and the Wife had to fly to Europe on an emergency basis. The Husband did not express unhappiness with the cost of the trip; in fact, he expressed appreciation of what the Wife was doing for B in his message to her in October 2021: “<em>Love you. And just know what an amazing mother doing what you are doing, It’s hard and I am sorry for not being as supportive as I should have been with [B] in the last few years. [B] is so very lucky that you are you. I know that we are going to have to be there for [B] for the rest of our lives and I will be there with you</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>”(words in square brackets replaced); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>c.     in fact, after October 2022, the Husband ceased financial support for B and the Wife had to borrow monies from her family to pay for B’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Husband also complained about other incidents, for instance, paying for the Wife’s trip to Hong Kong in June 2022 but the Wife’s evidence was that this was planned for over a year to attend the wedding of her niece and the Husband had long offered to pay for the trip<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>. As for his complaint that the Wife had rented an expensive apartment in June 2022, this was after he had already initiated separation; his messages showed that he agreed to the rental and proceeded to adjust the budget by cutting the Wife’s and B’s allowance instead<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Ultimately, the Husband was the sole breadwinner with absolute financial control and the Wife was the homemaker raising three (3) children in the family. If the Husband was indeed unhappy with the Wife’s expenditure, he could decide what he would or would not pay for by, for instance, adjusting the cash allowance he gave to the Wife, setting credit limits on her cards, or declining to pay for certain expenses but there is no evidence he had ever done so; it therefore does not now lie in his mouth to complain that the Wife was a spendthrift and financially irresponsible. Indeed, for the court to hold that the Wife behaved unreasonably in not providing financial support for her children or doing some online shopping on Lazada would be serving an injustice to homemaker wives who give up the ability to earn an independent income to care for the children at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Hence, I am not persuaded that the Husband has proven any of his allegations of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The Husband is grasping at straws to bolster his case</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In my judgment, the Husband is in fact grasping at straws to bolster his case of unreasonable behaviour against the Wife. It is clear that by April 2022, he had emotionally checked out of the marriage by joining a dating app Coffee Meets Bagel and starting to date Ms. D. He deliberately recorded the conversation on 10 May 2022 where he ambushed the Wife with separation. He probably did not intend at the time to rely on unreasonable behaviour against her as a ground for divorce: separation was already in effect and as of August 2022 which was some 4 months later, he had not filed any divorce proceedings against her. However, after the Wife’s private investigator caught him having an affair with Ms. D and the Wife filed for divorce on his adultery in August 2022, he retaliated by filing a counterclaim of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour in September 2022. This explained why his pleadings and evidence on his counterclaim were so scanty - because in the first place, he knew that the triviality of his unsubstantiated claims would amount to grasping at straws and not pass the court’s reasonable scrutiny; hence, he had initially only effected separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In these circumstances, I dismissed the Husband’s counterclaim. As costs follow the event, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife costs of $6,500.00. I note that the costs of the Wife’s private investigator alone amounted to around $16,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <u>Conclusion</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I would reiterate what I had held in <em>UJD v UJE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21386-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 12</a> at [52] that the <em>raison d’etre</em> of the divorce laws in Singapore is to safeguard the sanctity of the institution of the marriage as a cornerstone of our society. If a spouse (unilaterally) decided that a marriage was over and proceeded to effect separation between parties (either under the same household or under two roofs), that did not confer upon the spouse the <em>carte blanche</em> or licence to rejoin the dating scene and indulge in improper associations or sexual relationships with third parties. Such behaviour may still be relied upon by the other spouse as unreasonable behaviour based on improper association or adultery for grounds for divorce, because parties remained married. The rationale for requiring a three (3) or four (4) years’ separation as grounds for divorce is so that the spouse could use the cooling off time to decide whether he or she wanted to reconcile or divorce the other spouse at the end of the period. It did not mean that the spouse could behave as if he/she were single and available without the marital obligations of fidelity and monogamy, and entangle unwitting single members of society in their marital complications (like for Ms. D who became named as a co-defendant in the Wife’s claim for adultery).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I would also reiterate in this case as I did in <em>UJD v UJE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21386-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 12</a> that the Husband owed it to his wife of twenty-one (21) years and the mother of his three (3) children (including his step-children) to wait out the period of separation, instead of blaming her for the breakdown of marriage. To his credit, the Husband did initiate separation in May 2022. Unfortunately, while waiting out the period of separation, he is found to have more likely than not to have committed adultery and this marriage is regrettably henceforth dissolved on this ground.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (“NE”) dated 05.09.2023;

There are two children of the marriage namely, <b>[Child 1]</b> (m) DOB xx October 2013 aged 10 years and <b>[Child 2]</b> (m) DOB xx July 2016 aged 7 years (“the said 2 children”). The marriage lasted about 10 years before the Mother filed Writ of Divorce on 7 January 2023 in FC/D xx/2023 in Singapore. The Father filed his Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) on 12 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Interim Judgement was granted on 12 June 2023 based on the fact that the Mother had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Father had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) and the marriage was dissolved by reason of the unreasonable behaviour of both Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       By consent, the issues of interim joint custody, with care and control of the said 2 children to the Mother and access to the Father, were resolved in a Court Order dated 18 April 2023. The Parties are now undergoing Discovery and Interrogatories under the divorce case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the meanwhile, the Mother filed MSS 1022 of 2023 on 8 May 2023 seeking interim maintenance for herself and the said 2 children, which application was heard before me on 4 September 2023 and 27 October 2023. In her application, the Mother sought the payment of $5,000.00 per month (being $2,500.00 per child) as maintenance for the said 2 children and the sum of $2,000.00 per month as maintenance for herself from the Father.

The Father was of the view that the Mother’s claim for $5,000.00 per month as maintenance for the said 2 children, was inflated and unreasonable<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father was also of the view that no maintenance should be payable by him to the Mother as she had started working since July 2023 and she had the ability to earn a significantly higher salary than what she was currently earning<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. The Father submitted that up to 2019, the Mother was a Senior Staff Nurse at [A] hospital dealing with chronic diseases and could earn about $5,000.00 per month. The Father also submitted that the Mother had not made any effort to find a full-time job commiserate with her experience and it was a deliberate decision by the Mother to take on a part time job at $2,000.00 a month when she had a full-time helper<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother’s case was that prior to their separation in December 2022, the Father was solely bearing all the family’s expenses of around $6,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. It was submitted that the Mother’s total monthly expenses was at $2,483.33 and the elder child’s total monthly expenses was at $3,458.50 with the younger child’s total monthly expenses at $3,226.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the Mother’s position was that the Father’s payment of $2,500.00 per month for the said 2 children’s maintenance was grossly inadequate<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. It was also submitted that the Father used to pay $500.00 for the Mother’s maintenance until he stopped paying this after June 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     It was further submitted that the Father had an earning capacity of up to $22,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and that he had confirmed that he would not pay what the Mother considered to be reasonable maintenance, without an Order of Court. The Mother asked for a fixed maintenance sum as it was submitted that it was “impossible” to get reimbursement from the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also wanted the maintenance payable by the Father to be back-dated to January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s Appeal</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As the Father’s appeal was filed first in time, I will deal with the Father’s appeal first. The Father has appealed against Clauses 1 to 5 of my Court Order in MO 489/2023 dated 27 October 2023. In effect, that is the entire Court Order that I made regarding the Mother’s application for interim maintenance for the said 2 children as I did not order any maintenance to be payable for the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In making my decision on the Mother’s application, I noted that the caselaw principles for interim maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter is clear. The Court of Appeal had said in the case of <b><em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0506.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 506</a></em></b> that the objective of section 69 applications is to provide the Wife and children with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help them overcome their immediate financial needs having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors listed in section 69(4). The “immediate financial needs” approach was adopted because section 69 applications are not final maintenance applications as this comes after the Ancillary Matters in the divorce case is finalised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Therefore, in my view, the key considerations for the payment of interim maintenance for the said 2 children were (i) the reasonableness of the monthly expenses of each child (ii) the income ratio disparity of the Parties and (iii) the Parties’ financial capacity to pay such maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I was also guided by the case of <b><em>APE v APF <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a></em></b>, wherein the Honourable Justice Tan Siong Thye held [at paragraph 43] that “<em>It is trite that maintenance is ordered in order to meet the reasonable needs of the child and if the child’s lifestyle is overly extravagant, the husband should not be made to bear the costs of it</em>.” And [at paragraph 45]: “<em>In arriving at my decision, I noted that the wife was indulging the child in many things which might be nice to have but were not reasonably necessary for the child’s needs</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My assessment of the said 2 children’s reasonable monthly expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I was of the view that as the Parties were currently undergoing divorce proceedings, it would be in the best interests of the said 2 children to minimise the acrimony between the Parties by providing for fixed maintenance wherever possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     However, at the same time, I also took into account the Father’s position he was happy to pay in full for the said 2 children’s maintenance expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> but that he needed proof of what he was paying for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, to be fair to the Father, I was also of the view that variable expenses would require the Father’s prior consent before he should be made liable to pay for such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In consideration of the above, and after taking into account the Parties’ positions, my assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses for the elder child was in the last column below as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.28145629125825%\"><col width=\"29.005801160232%\"><col width=\"20.4440888177636%\"><col width=\"22.0844168833767%\"><col width=\"21.1842368473695%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>ITEM</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">School related items </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$200.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Additional school fees of $65 and also school excursions at about $20.

At the same time, I assessed that the income ratio disparity of the Parties was at 85% (Father) vs 15% (Mother), which was confirmed by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the issue of capacity to pay, I noted that the Father had testified that his current income was at the nett amount of $11,297.00 per month and after paying his own total monthly expenses, which included the sum of $2,500.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> that he was currently paying for the said 2 children’s maintenance, this would leave him with the monthly disposable income of around $4,000.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> or the sum of $6,500.00 disposable income per month excluding the said 2 children’s maintenance. I further noted that the Father had himself testified that he was willing to bear the entirety, that is to say 100% of the said 2 children’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I also took into account the fact that I had agreed with the Father than no maintenance was payable by him for the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> at this stage. However, I was aware that as the Parent with care and control of the said 2 children, there would be many daily miscellaneous expenses that the Mother would be incurring in her care of the said 2 children, on her current nett income of $2,000.00 per month less her own monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this regard, I was guided by the case of <b><em>AUA v ATZ <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a></em></b> [paragraph 41] wherein the Court of Appeal held that “<em>both Parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was also guided by the case of <b><em>BPC v BPB [2019] SGCA 03</em></b>, wherein the Court of Appeal held [at paragraph 111] that section 68 of the Woman’s Charter, does not mandate that each Parent should bear an equal share of the burden of providing maintenance for their children. The Court of Appeal said that “<em>We do not accept that s68 mandates such a result. Although Parents do indeed share an equal responsibility for looking after their children, this ought not to necessarily translate into each Parent bearing an equal share of the burden to provide maintenance for their children. This is because the extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors enumerated by s.114(1) of the Charter.”</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     On a balance of all the above factors, I was of the view that the Father should pay the sum of $3,000.00 per month based on my assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses of $1,525.00 for a 10-year-old (elder child) + $1,480.00 for a 7-year-old (younger child) = $3,005.00 rounded to $3,000.00 as fixed maintenance per month for the said 2 children. This was provided in Clause 1 of my Court Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In fact, my assessment of the elder child’s reasonable monthly expenses was less than what the Father himself accepted was reasonable at $1,758.48 plus reimbursements (see table at Paragraph 19 above). The same for the younger child, as the Father’s figure was at $1,557.48 plus reimbursements (see table at Paragraph 20 above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As for Clause 2 of my Court Order, after taking into account the Mother’s repeated concern that it was “impossible” to get reimbursement from the Father, balanced against the Father’s position that he needed proof or supporting documents for what he was paying for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>, I was of the view that a separate provision was required for the agreed enrichment activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> with proof of payment after. This was capped at the current amounts in the monthly sum of $1,511.00 as stated in Clause 2 of my Court Order. In this way, the Father was only obliged to pay for what had already been agreed upon and the Mother was only required to provide proof of payment to confirm what the Father had paid for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Therefore, the total monthly amount payable by the Father for the said 2 children’s monthly maintenance, was in the sum of $4,511 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> which, in my assessment, was at about 40% of his nett income and within his monthly disposable income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In Clause 3 of my Court Order, I also provided for the said 2 children’s other variable expenses in another separate provision on a reimbursement basis because these were ad hoc and not fixed monthly expenses. In Clause 4 of my Court Order, I provided for the Father’s continued payment of the said 2 children’s current insurance policies as the Father had confirmed that he had been making such payments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Clause 5 of my Court Order sets out the details of payment by the Father into the Mother’s bank account, which is self-explanatory. The date of payment being 1<sup>st</sup> November 2023 was in fact proposed by the Father himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\"> <em>The Mother’s Appeal</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The crux of the Mother’s appeal is that I did not order the Father to pay back-dated maintenance with effect from January 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On the issue of back-dated maintenance, I drew guidance from the case of <b><em>AJE v AJF <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0115.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 115</a></em></b> wherein the High Court held that [at paragraph 27 of the case] “<em>The determination of the operative date is governed by the facts of each case. If the applicant had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance. On the other hand, if the applicant had been able to manage with the pre-ordered maintenance, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for back-dating would be weaker</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The evidence showed that it was not disputed that the Father had been paying maintenance of over $2,000.00 per month for the said 2 children since January 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In addition, it was not disputed that from January 2023 to June 2023, the Father also paid what he called “a contribution” to the Mother in the sum of $500.00 per month because she was not working at the time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I noted that it was the Mother’s case that the Father had been solely bearing the family’s expenses prior to December 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> when the Parties separated. However, other than a bare assertion that she had to borrow money, which was at paragraphs 18 and 24 of Exhibit C (Mother’s Affidavit-In-Chief), there was no evidence to show what the Mother had to do to make up for the shortfall, if any, of the Mother’s and said 2 children’s expenses from January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My Decision on the Mother’s Case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Therefore, in my view, there was insufficient evidence to show that there were maintenance arrears and that back-dating was warranted in the case.</p> <p

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Complainant Mother and the Respondent Father had entered into a consent order on all ancillary matters, which included an order for joint custody to the parties, sole care and control to the Complainant, and various maintenance obligations on the Respondent’s part, including the payment of their children’s childcare and school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In July 2023, the Complainant filed an enforcement application, claiming 3 months’ worth of preschool fees for C3 that the Respondent had refused to pay. After hearing the parties, I granted the Complainant’s application and ordered the Respondent to pay the full arrears of $4,547.43 claimed. The Respondent has since appealed. I now set out my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Complainant and the Respondent were married in October 2011. There are 3 children to the marriage, who were respectively 10, 8 and 4 years old at the time of the application. I refer to them in descending order of age as C1, C2 and C3 respectively (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Complainant and the Respondent attended mediation under the Family Dispute Resolution Division of the Family Justice Courts (“FDR Mediation”), where parties reached a global resolution of all ancillary matters. This was recorded as part of the interim judgment entered on 14 May 2019 (the “Consent Order”). Both parties were represented by counsel at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Consent Order provided that parties were to have joint custody of the Children, with sole care and control to the Complainant. The orders relating to the Children’s maintenance were set out at Clause 3(f) of the Consent Order, which reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The [Respondent] shall pay $3,000.00, being $1,000.00 for each child, as monthly maintenance for the Children with effect from the last day of May 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month into the [Complainant’s] designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In addition, the [Respondent] shall pay for the following expenses incurred by the Children directly to the third party or on a reimbursement basis to the [Complainant]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Childcare/student Care/school fees and all education expenses including school allowance, school bus, ad hoc school expenses, school uniform, stationeries, textbooks, tuition and enrichment classes and school trips;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Medical and dental expenses; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Insurance premiums for existing insurance policies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Provided that the [Complainant] moves into rented accommodation to stay with the Children, the [Respondent] shall pay an additional $1,000.00 per month towards the [Complainant’s] rental for accommodation pending the completion of the transfer/sale of the Matrimonial Home. The [Complainant] shall provide the tenancy agreement as proof of rental.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the time that the Consent Order was granted in May 2019, C3 was just under one year old. After the Complainant moved out of the matrimonial flat and into a rented apartment in Bedok North, she enrolled C2 and C3 into Sparkletots, with C2 in Kindergarten and C3 in infant care. C1 was already in primary school by then. This Sparkletots centre was situated at the ground floor of the block next to the Complainant’s apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Sometime in January 2022, the Complainant enrolled C3 into MindChamps Performing Arts International Preschool @Changi Business Park Pte Ltd (“MindChamps”), in anticipation of the Complainant’s move to her current residence at Bedok South. By this time, C2 had progressed to primary school. The preschool fees at MindChamps were about $1,600.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. These fees were deducted from C3’s Child Development Account (“CDA”) until the balance therein was insufficient to pay for any further fees. When this happened, the Complainant asked the Respondent to top up C3’s CDA for the purposes of paying C3’s fees at MindChamps. The Respondent refused to do so. The Complainant therefore took a loan from her parents to make payment of the outstanding fees of $4,547.43, being the fees owed to MindChamps for December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023. This is the amount that the Complainant claimed as the arrears she sought to enforce in this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The applicable legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Complainant’s enforcement application was made under Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “Charter”). Section 71 of the Charter sets out the court’s powers to make various orders in the event that a person fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       While Section 71 of the Charter itself does not provide for any statutory exceptions or mitigating circumstances under which the arrears claimed should not be enforced, it is well established that the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is the opportunity for the respondent to “show cause” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full or in part: <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> (“<em>Lai Ching Kin”</em>) at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Whether a respondent has “shown cause” or not is ultimately a fact-sensitive exercise. The touchstone of the inquiry is whether, given the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be inequitable to make an enforcement order or if doing so would lead to injustice: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> at [20]-[22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Complainant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Complainant claimed that the Respondent was obliged to pay her the sum of $4,547.43, being C3’s MindChamps fees for November 2022, December 2022 and January 2023, in accordance with his obligations under Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order. The Complainant argues that the express terms of the order made the Respondent responsible for these preschool fees, without exception or restriction, and that the Respondent should therefore be held accountable as such.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In short, the Respondent refused to pay for C3’s fees at MindChamps because he had not consented to it. To his mind, there was no need for C3 to be enrolled into a preschool as expensive as MindChamps. C3, like C2, was previously enrolled at Sparkletots at Bedok North. The Respondent did not feel that children of C3’s age needed to attend “good schools”, and that money spent on a “good school” was not worth it, given C3’s young age<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent was of the view that C3 should have remained in Sparkletots.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Respondent accordingly proposed that C3 be transferred back to Sparkletots, in which case he would pay for C3’s Sparkletots fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Alternatively, if the Complainant wanted C3 to continue attending MindCamps, the Respondent said that he would contribute $750.00 per month, being what he estimated would be the cost of C3’s fees for his age group at Sparkletots<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. At the hearing on 30 October 2023, the Respondent clarified that his offer was to pay $750.00 per month for C3’s fees for the year 2022, and a reduced monthly amount of $150.00 for the fees in year 2023, being what he felt was the appropriate fee for the year given C3’s progression into Kindergarten 1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">On a plain reading of the order, is the Respondent required to pay for C3’s school fees?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As provided in Section 71 of the Charter, the court’s power to make an enforcement order is triggered when a person “fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order”. The first inquiry is therefore whether or not the Respondent was <em>required</em> to make the payment of $4,547.43 under the terms of the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To determine whether or not a payment is <em>required to be made under a maintenance order</em>, the starting point must be to examine the plain language of the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the outset, I note that the Respondent does not dispute that this clause could apply to C3’s preschool fees <em>generally</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>: the Respondent only disputes the Complainant’s <em>choice</em> of preschool, and would have had no qualms paying for C3’s preschool fees pursuant to this clause, if C3 had continued in Sparkletots instead. Indeed, Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order requires the Respondent to either pay directly or reimburse the Complainant for the Children’s “Childcare/student Care/school fees and all education expenses including school allowance, school bus, ad hoc school expenses, school uniform, stationeries, textbooks, tuition and enrichment classes and school trips”<em>.</em> From the inclusive and permissive language used, I infer that this intended to encompass all of the Children’s education-related expenses until the Children completed formal schooling. Even though this clause does not specifically state that “nursery”, or “kindergarten”, or “preschool” fees would be included, I find that the definition of “childcare” or “school” in this clause would be wide enough to encompass preschool fees. In any event, it was not disputed that this clause could apply to C3’s preschool fees:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Notwithstanding this, the Respondent does not believe that he is required to pay for C3’s preschool fees <em>at MindChamps</em>, primarily because the Complainant had enrolled C3 into MindChamps without his consent. The logical conclusion of the Respondent’s argument is this: if the Respondent was not <em>required</em> to make this payment under a maintenance order, then there are effectively no arrears to enforce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In <em>VCL v VCM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23785-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 122</a> (“VCL v VCM”) (at [31]), the court held the view that where there was no express order stipulating that the paying party’s consent had to be obtained before he paid for certain expenses provided for in the maintenance order, “it would be untenable to adopt the position that there be consent – and express consent at that – on an intended course of action undertaken by a child, before a payer of maintenance pays anything”. The danger of adopting this position is that it “would create a perverse incentive for payers of maintenance to refuse blithely their consent on major decisions in a child’s life, in order to avoid paying the necessary and attendant expenses.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the facts, I find that there was no requirement for the Complainant to first obtain the Respondent’s consent before C3’s preschool fees at MindChamps could be payable. The wording of Clause 3(f)(b) of the Consent Order is clear and unambiguous. There is no express proviso stating that the Respondent’s obligation to pay for any of these specified expenses would be subject to the Complainant first seeking and obtaining the Respondent’s agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The agreement on the terms of the Consent Order was reached at FDR Mediation, where both parties were represented and had the benefit of legal advice. If there was any intention for the Respondent’s consent to have been sought first as a precondition before any of the expenses stipulated in Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order were incurred, this should have been expressly worded into the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Similarly, if there was any intention for C3 to be enrolled only into Sparkletots or another preschool in a similar, if not the same, cost bracket, this should also have been stipulated in the order. In this regard, I note that Clause 3(f)(b)(iii) of the Consent Order (which relates to the payment of the Children’s insurance premiums) expressly caveats that the Respondent would be responsible only for the premiums of <em>existing</em> insurance policies. This suggests that parties <em>were</em> aware of and <em>did</em> apply their minds to the option of inserting restrictions and limits into the wording of the clauses. To my mind, the inference that arises is that parties were therefore contented <em>not</em> to place any such restrictions on the other expenses listed, including that of the Children’s education expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I therefore find, without difficulty, that on the plain reading of Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order, the Respondent was indeed required to pay for C3’s preschool fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Does the order for joint custody imply that the Complainant was required to obtain the Respondent’s consent before enrolling C3 into MindChamps? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Respondent nevertheless argued that because he was granted joint custody of the Children, he has a “50% stake in the decision-making process of the children.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> As such, the Complainant should not have enrolled C3 into MindChamps without his consent, even if the express terms of Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order did not specifically provide for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     However, on the facts of this case, I find that the order for joint custody does not stretch so far as to require the Respondent’s consent to C3’s enrolment into a preschool, and at least not to the extent where it would nullify his obligations under Clause 3(f)(b) of the Consent Order. I elaborate as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Court of Appeal in <em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (“<em>CX v CY</em>”) at [31] described “custody” as the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a “care and control” order. A “care and control” concerns the day-to-day decision-making of a child and dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. In contrast, residual “custody” concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The concepts of “custody” and “care and control” were more recently summarised in <em>VJM v VJL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26170-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 16</a> (“<em>VJM v VJL</em>”) at [18] as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Our law adopts the legal constructs of ‘custody’, ‘care and control’ and ‘access’, which are used to support families in which the child’s parents have separated. As ‘custody’ refers to the decision-making authority and responsibility in major aspects of the child’s life, ‘custody’ is not directly dependent on having physical time with the child. In contrast, ‘care and control’ involves physical time with the child, caregiving, and the residence of the child with the parent as well as that parent’s decision-making responsibility over day-to-day matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In <em>CX v CY</em>, the Court of Appeal broadly observed (at [35]) that matters pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues were examples of the type of decisions that would generally be covered by a “custody” order. However, in my reading, one must be careful not to construe the Court of Appeal’s observations as a pronouncement that <em>every</em> decision relating to these issues must be made jointly (where a joint custody order is granted). Rather, the key inquiry is whether, to use the Court of Appeal’s words, the matter “would be considered [an] important and longer-term [decision] concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Parents routinely make a wide range of education-related decisions throughout their children’s lives. Some decisions will invariably be more significant and of greater consequence than others. Where an order for joint custody is granted, which is now the norm, it could be counter-productive to a child’s welfare if every education-related decision had to be made jointly. This is especially so where parties do not readily see eye-to-eye (which is not unusual between separated parents), or where an access parent who has minimal or irregular contact with the children is effectively given a veto on matters that would affect the children’s – and consequently the primary caregiver’s – day-to-day lives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As such, it is natural that in a situation where a joint custody order is made with an order for sole care and control to a parent, that the care and control parent is trusted with the freedom to make various decisions, without the need to obtain the other parent’s consent. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s views at paragraph 30 of <em>CX v CY</em>, which left room for some education-related decisions to be made by the care and control parent (rather than necessarily jointly between parents with custodial rights), depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In other words, a “custody order” only gives the parent the residual right to decide on long-term matters affecting the child’s welfare. For instance, the right to decide on the type of education resides with the parent(s) with custody as it concerns the more important and long-term aspects of a child’s upbringing. The right to decide the particular school may also reside with the custodian(s) <b>depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education</b>.” [emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the present case, there was no dispute as to the <em>type</em> of education that C3 should receive at his age: both parties were agreed that C3 should be sent to a formal preschool, rather than other alternative forms of education such as homeschooling. Rather, the dispute at hand here was of the <em>choice</em> of preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my view, given the level of importance of choosing a child’s <em>preschool</em>, relative to the importance of choosing other institutions that the child may stand to be enrolled for in the future (for instance, for the child’s primary, secondary and tertiary education), this could conceivably be a decision left to be made by the parent with care and control. Unlike primary school education, which is mandatory for Singapore citizens under Section 3(1) of the Compulsory Education Act 2000, preschool education is completely optional. There are no formal examinations at preschool level, and how “well” a child “performs” at their preschool has no formal bearing on the child’s subsequent entry into his or her primary school. The selection of preschool, to put bluntly, is a decision of limited long-term academic impact on a child, relative to every other institution the child may subsequently be enrolled into.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Furthermore, many parents, even in functional marriages, regard preschool as a form of childcare; a place to mind one’s children while they work. As such, besides choosing a preschool for reasons such as the types of activities offered, the teacher-to-child ratio, and the use of a bilingual curriculum, many parents also prioritise other practical factors such as proximity to their residence and their place(s) of work, and whether or not a preschool offers a full-day programme. These are factors that relate to the management of a child’s caregiving arrangements and day-to-day affairs, which fall within the scope of a care and control parent’s responsibilities as defined in <em>VJM v VJL</em>. This supports my view that once the decision to send C3 to preschool has been made by the parties, the <em>choice</em> of preschool could reasonably be left to the Complainant, being the care and control parent, to decide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     All things considered, I did not find the difference between preschools – in this case between Sparkletots and MindChamps, to be so significant and important to C3’s welfare as to fetter the Complainant’s prerogative as the care and control parent to decide where C3 should be enrolled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Having said this, I would caveat that my views as above should not be taken by the Complainant as a <em>carte blanche</em> to incur expenses in an uninhibited manner, or with disregard to the Respondent’s views. It remains open to the court hearing an enforcement application to decide that it would be unjust to enforce an expense that the Respondent was not at least consulted on, especially if the expense is a significant one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As referenced above, the court in <em>VCL v VCM</em> found that the payor’s consent was not a prerequisite to his obligation to pay for the necessary expenses where there was no express order to this effect. However, the court was also of the view that the payor should not be made to blindly pay for new or additional expenses he had not been informed of. To this end, the court highlighted the importance of <em>both parents</em> consulting and cooperating with each other, particularly on expected milestones (at [34]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Particularly where expected milestones such as primary school registration, graduation etcetera are concerned, an access parent should exercise initiative and broach the topic for discussion, and not always expect the care and control parent to approach him/her to consult him or her first. This is because the access parent is in no less a position than the care and control parent, to know when such major life events will be arising, and has an equal right to start the consultation process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Furthermore, a complainant’s <em>right</em> to incur various expenses is tempered by the expectation that such expenses must be reasonably incurred, or the complainant may find difficulty in enforcing the full sum claimed as arrears. To illustrate, a complainant may choose to spend an astronomical amount on expensive, branded stationery her children, and indeed she could be entitled to do so. However, the complainant’s expenditure may not necessarily be endorsed by the court should she seek to enforce the full cost of her luxurious spend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Ultimately, even where the arrears may be established and unarguable, a respondent will be given the opportunity during enforcement proceedings to show good cause why the arrears should not be enforced. In my view, the more <em>unreasonable</em> the expense incurred by a complainant, and the more <em>unreasonably</em> a complainant has conducted herself, the easier it may be for the respondent to show good cause for refusing to pay these arrears. At this juncture, I reiterate that the court will not compel a respondent to make payment where it would be inequitable for him to do so. In this vein, I proceed to examine if the Respondent in this case has shown good cause why the arrears of $4,547.43 should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Is there nevertheless any good cause why the arrears should not be enforced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To restate the court’s observations in <em>Lai Ching Kin</em> (at [10]), enforcement proceedings provide the respondent with an opportunity to “show reason” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full or in part. At the heart of this process is the desire to prevent injustice by ensuring that the maintenance orders are not “blindly enforced in the face of legitimate reasons for the failure of husbands and fathers to make payment.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     This being the Respondent’s opportunity to show cause, the burden of proof logically rests on him. In the present case, the Respondent’s chief argument is that C3 should have remained in Sparkletots, and not enrolled into MindChamps. The corollary of this is that the Complainant had therefore acted unreasonably in enrolling C3 into MindChamps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having considered the evidence and submissions, I find that the Respondent failed to sufficiently prove that the Complainant had acted so unreasonably, or that C3’s enrolment into MindChamps was so unreasonable, that it would be considered “good reason” for the Respondent to refuse payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41      <em>Firstly</em>, I accepted that the Complainant had legitimate reasons for enrolling C3 into MindChamps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Complainant’s reasons were, in summary, as follows. Although C3 (together with C2) used to attend Sparkletots near their previous residence at Bedok North, this was only a temporary arrangement and a function of where the Complainant was living at the time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> After C2 graduated, the Complainant was informed by Sparkletots that C3 had to be placed on a waiting list if he were to continue there because of the quota on the number of students progressing to the next level.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When the Complainant was about to move out of her rented apartment and into her current residence in Bedok South, she placed C3 on the waiting list of various schools which were more conveniently located for her, including a Sparkletots and a My First Skool. However, as only MindChamps was able to enrol C3 immediately, the Complainant proceeded to enrol him there so to avoid disrupting his education<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In any case, having observed C2’s struggles in keeping up with the curriculum in primary school after graduating from Sparkletots, the Complainant felt that MindChamps would better prepare C3 for primary school than Sparkletots would. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>Additionally, the Complainant’s change in residence meant a different route to her workplace, such that a switch to MindChamps (which was located along the way to her workplace) would save her about 15-20 minutes of travel time each way<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Respondent did not rebut the Complainant’s evidence at trial, nor did he offer any compelling reason to doubt the veracity of the Complainant’s evidence and her reasons. On the face of the evidence, I found the Complainant’s reasons to have been legitimate and mostly motivated by C3’s welfare, if not a function of the change in her living arrangements. There was no basis for me to find that this enrolment was done for an untoward parallel purpose, such as inflating the Respondent’s financial outlay. If the Complainant’s intention was simply to take advantage of the Respondent’s agreement to pay for the Children’s expenses pursuant to Clause 3(f)(b), the Complainant could have signed C3 up to a more expensive preschool or incurred a host of other expenses in the name of the Children’s “education” to claim the same from the Respondent. This was not the situation here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I also found that the Respondent’s objection to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps was premised less on C3’s interests, but more on his reluctance to pay the sums sought. The Respondent never offered any reasons as to why C3’s enrolment into MindChamps would be <em>contrary</em> to C3’s welfare. The Respondent in fact acknowledges that MindChamps is a good preschool, but simply posits that “children at his age… do not need to attend good schools” and that “money spent on a good school at that age is not worth it.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Respondent did not ask for C3 to be removed from MindChamps, nor has he taken out any application to that effect. It therefore appears to me that in terms of C3’s welfare and interests, the Respondent does not actually have any objections to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps. In my view, this diluted the strength of the Respondent’s reasons for refusing to consent to C3’s enrolment, and fortified the reasonableness of the Complainant’s decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45      <em>Secondly</em>, I find that the Complainant, on account of the Respondent’s conduct and acquiescence, had reason to believe that she could decide on C3’s preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     It does not escape me that the decision to enrol C3 into Sparkletots was one that was effectively made unilaterally by the Complainant in the first place. The Complainant had enrolled C2 and C3 into a Sparkletots centre that operated from the block next to her rented apartment at Bedok North, ostensibly choosing to do so out of convenience more than anything else as she needed somewhere nearby that had both infant care and childcare services. In the Respondent’s own words, “[the Complainant] moved out of her mum’s house so [C3] had to go somewhere and. I don’t know whose idea it was, but end up Sparkletots, I accepted it, you know.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Prior to this, C1 and C2 attended preschool at the Kindergarten at the Church of Holy Trinity in Tampines<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, which was the church that the parties attended as a family. There was no evidence that the Respondent demanded that C3 similarly be enrolled in this church kindergarten, and by all accounts the Respondent was happy for C2 and C3 to be enrolled into Sparkletots and had no issues with the Complainant’s choice. In my view, this state of affairs gave the Complainant good reason to believe that the Respondent would have no issues with C3 unilaterally deciding on C3’s enrolment into MindChamps, given that he never raised any issue with her choosing to enrol C2 and C3 into Sparkletots previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the same vein, the Respondent never actually raised any objection to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps until he was asked by the Complainant to make monetary top-ups into C3’s CDA sometime in September 2022. By this time, C3 had already been enrolled in MindChamps for 9 months or so, having started in MindChamps in January 2022. The Respondent continued to have access to C3 throughout this period, and would have known of C3’s new enrolment if not through his conversations with C3, then from the very fact that C3 would show up for his weekday access with the Respondent in a MindChamps uniform<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> instead of a Sparkletots one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In <em>VCL v VCM</em>, the court espoused the importance of <em>both</em> parents communicating meaningfully, and emphasised the responsibility of the access parent to proactively communicate his or her views. I find the court’s observations to be apposite to the present situation, and I quote the salient portions in full for the benefit of the parties (at [33] and [35]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    All too often, the care and control parent is blamed – rightly or wrongly – for failing to inform the access parent of events and happenings in a child’s life. However, <b>where joint or no custody orders are concerned, it is clear to me that the responsibility for consulting and cooperation falls equally on both parents</b>. Of course as a matter of practical realities, the care and control parent would usually be the one keeping tabs of, and being the first to know of a child’s significant life events or milestones. <b>But being involved in a child’s life such that the joint custody order is meaningful and its purpose achieved, means that both parents are to be proactive, not just the care and control parent</b>. It cannot be the job of the latter to ensure that the access parent has perfect information on the major events of a child’s life – the access parent has to be responsible for seeking such information too. In fact, one may suggest that precisely because the access parent does not live with the child, it behoves him or her to actively engage the child or care and control parent on developments and updates in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35    In my view, <b>generally, once there has been communication to the access parent of an impending life event or milestone or decision to be taken, the burden is then on the access parent to respond to those communications and offer his or her views and input</b>. There is no need for the care and control parent to invite the access parent to proffer views – it is the entitlement of the latter and <b>he or she should exercise that right without need for solicitation.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in bold]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Respondent does not dispute that the Complainant had asked him about enrolling C3 into MindChamps sometime in late 2021, before C3 was formally enrolled in January 2022. If the Respondent held strong objections to C3’s enrolment in MindChamps, he should have communicated this to the Complainant at the earliest possible juncture. The Respondent however chose to remain silent in a situation that warranted a clear and constructive response. The Respondent’s position was, in his own words, that “at no point did I give my agreement… which to me, means I disagree.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This, to me, is unsatisfactory. It does not behove him to sit on his hands when consulted about sending C3 to MindChamps, only to be up in arms when he is asked to make payment, especially where he would have been aware of his maintenance obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I therefore find in the circumstances that the Respondent had tacitly acquiesced to the Complainant enrolling C3 into MindChamps, and that in this context, the Complainant had not acted unreasonably in doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51      <em>Thirdly</em>, and relatedly, I find that the Respondent was not so proactive and communicative in discussing C3’s options in November 2022 (the month of the first MindChamps bill claimed as part of the Complainant’s arrears), that it would in the circumstances render it unreasonable for the Complainant to have continued with C3’s enrolment into MindChamps thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While the Respondent objected to C3’s enrolment into MindChamps once he was asked to pay for it, he never proposed any concrete, reasonable alternative, bearing in mind the reasons for switching C3’s preschool as explained by the Complainant. There is no evidence of any attempt by the Respondent to engage or address the Complainant on her concerns and reasons for the switch, apart from him making the sweeping statement (via text messages sent on 12 November 2022) that the quality of preschool education “makes no difference to [C3’s] development.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> When the Complainant expressly told him that she had already given him her reasons for enrolling C3 into this school, and that he therefore “cannot just say that it’s just all the same”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, the Respondent’s reply was brief and without elaboration: “U may feel that his new school is good but i don’t agree. I didn’t agree to mindchamps and u went ahead anyway”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Respondent’s bottom line appeared to be as communicated in his text message to the Complainant: “if u make decision urself, u have to deal with the consequences.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Respondent seemed most concerned about the limits of his liability, rather than with trying to do what he felt was truly best for C3, telling the Complainant “U always just spend my money like its free”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, and “since u made the decision urself, u have to pay for it.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     On the evidence, I find that the Respondent did not leave the Complainant with any options to consider besides re-enrolling C3 into Sparkletots or continuing with MindChamps with limited monetary contribution from him. The Respondent’s only other suggestion was for the Complainant to withdraw C1 and C2 from their after-school student care (which he had been paying for), which would save the Respondent an additional $500.00 per month which he could then divert toward C3’s MindChamp fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. This struck me as a facetious suggestion given that the Complainant was not able to make alternative childcare arrangements for C1 and C2, and given that Clause 3(f)(b)(i) of the Consent Order had expressly contemplated the need for student care services. It appeared to me that the Respondent simply did not want to increase his financial outlay. Further, despite the Respondent’s professed willingness to contribute $750.00 per month towards C3’s preschool fees, I note that the Respondent never voluntarily made any such payment to the Complainant at all, which, in my view, diminished the sincerity of the Respondent’s offer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. In this context, and given the Complainant’s reasons for withdrawing C3 from Sparkletots which were not rebutted by the Respondent, it cannot be said that the Complainant had acted unreasonably in continuing with C3’s enrolment in MindChamps from November 2022 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55      <em>Lastly</em>, I did not find the cost of C3’s fees at MindChamps to be so exorbitant as to be unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     It was not disputed that at or around the time the Consent Order was granted, C3 was enrolled into infant care at Sparkletots. This cost around $2,000.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>, which is about $400.00 more than C3’s average monthly fees at MindChamps. It is Respondent’s evidence that he paid this, without more, even though he felt, in his own words, that “it was quite a lot of money”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     With this in mind, I find it reasonable for the Complainant to have chosen to enrol C3 into a school that cost less than an amount that she knew the Respondent had previously paid. While I find that the sum of about $1,600.00 per month is objectively high, given that the Respondent had previously paid for a higher fee without issue, I do not find it unreasonable for the Complainant to have considered this to be beyond the scope of what the Respondent could pay, or what he may reasonably be expected to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I note that C3’s preschool fees for January 2022 to October 2022 had been paid for using C3’s CDA monies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, even though this was supposed to have been paid for by the Respondent. The Respondent had ostensibly benefitted from at least 9 months’ worth of non-payment, which even at the monthly fee of $750.00 he was willing to pay, would have amounted to $6,750.00 in savings and is exceeds the arrears claimed by the Complainant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     All things considered, I therefore did not find that the Complainant had acted unreasonably in enrolling C3 into MindChamps, and thereafter in continuing with C3’s education in MindChamps past November 2022. Consequently, I do not find any good cause why the arrears of $4,547.43 should not be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Having established the Respondent’s obligation to pay for the arrears, and given the Respondent’s candid admission that he has the ability to pay the amount of $4,547.43 in full<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, I so ordered that the Respondent pay to the Complainant the full sum of $4,547.43 by 15 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As costs follow the event, I also ordered costs fixed at $1,000.00 (all-in, including disbursements) payable by the Respondent to the Complainant, also by 15 November 2023. I made this order in consideration of the costs incurred by the Complainant in these proceedings including the costs of attendance at a half-day contested trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     For completeness, while the Complainant additionally sought an order for a banker’s guarantee, I declined to make such an order. I found that there was no need for it in the circumstances and noted that the Respondent had, to his credit, been faithfully making payment on the other aspects of the Consent Order that were not in dispute. As this was not appealed against, I do not elaborate any further on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It is unfortunate that much of the present dispute arose from a difference in parties' understanding as to the scope and application of the order for joint custody, which led to their inability to reach a consensus on how to deal with the payment of three months’ worth of preschool fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In delivering my oral judgment, I conveyed to the parties that an order for joint custody is more than just a veto that either party holds, but represents a commitment made by both parties to work proactively and collaboratively towards the interests of the Children. I hope that with better clarity on each party’s obligations as parents and as partners in this joint-parenting endeavour, and with a more charitable view of each other’s choices, further dispute can be avoided.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for hearing on 30 October 2023 (“NE”), p 25</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Respondent’s Affidavit dated 19 September 2023 (“RAEIC”), [6.1]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>RAEIC, [6.2.1]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>RAEIC, [6.2.2]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>NE, p 30-31</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE, p 28</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE, p 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Complainant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“CAEIC”), [12], [14];

I heard the learned counsel for the Husband. I dismissed the application. The Husband filed an appeal. Here I give the reasons for my judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       This application was filed by the Husband in September 2023. The Husband and the Wife had married 6 months earlier, in March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       They have no children from the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband wished to have a divorce based on the unreasonable behaviour of the Wife. He listed the following facts in his proposed statement of particulars:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Sometime after the marriage was registered, the Husband and Wife’s families had dinner together. The Husband went to the Wife’s home. The Wife went straight into her bedroom, packed her clothes and informed the Husband that she had to return to Malaysia to meet suppliers. Although it is not clear from the statement of particulars, this appeared to have happened on the wedding night itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The Husband claimed that since then the Wife went to live a separate life from him in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. She did not divulge her location to the Husband. She claimed that she needed to rent the apartment there in order to regularly meet her suppliers in her ornamental fish business, and she wanted to avoid the traffic jam at the Causeway. Whenever she came to Singapore she would nevertheless return to Johor on the same day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     Before the marriage, the Wife had told the Husband that she wanted to have 2 children, a boy would be named G***, and a girl to be named S***. She told the Husband that she wanted to tattoo the names G***, S***, and the Husband’s name on her arms. However, the Husband discovered that the Wife got a tattoo of G*** only, and he also discovered that the Wife’s name was tattooed on the arm of another man, also named G***, whom the Wife claimed G*** to be a friend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     A few days after the wedding, the Husband discovered that the Wife was in a relationship with G***.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_v\"></a>(v)     The Husband’s sister-in-law was expecting a baby. The Wife obtained copies of the CT scan containing the baby. She sent it to G***’s wife. The Wife claimed that she was expecting a child by the Husband. The Wife told G***’s wife that the Husband was not ready to have a child, and that G*** was prepared to raise the child as his own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     The Husband confronted the Wife, and the latter claimed that it was all a misunderstanding. However, not long thereafter, the Husband discovered a post shared by G*** showing himself intimately with the Wife, titled “Happy Monthsary”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_vii\"></a>(vii)     The Wife admitted to committing adultery with G***.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_viii\"></a>(viii)    The Husband also relied on the Wife’s other conduct. He alleged that she showed up at his aunt’s funeral but refused to partake in funerary rituals. She spent the whole duration talking to G*** or texting him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_ix\"></a>(ix)     The Wife requested the Husband to withdraw his name from their joint BTO application and allow G*** to take over instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_x\"></a>(x)     The Husband had to bear the pain of the Wife’s conduct and he was frequently questioned by his family members about the Wife’s whereabouts. He claimed that he was plagued and traumatised by thoughts of the Wife’s infidelity behind his back. He felt so stressed and sick that he vomited from the thought. His mental health was badly affected and he moved out of the Wife’s parents’ flat. He also claimed that the strain places him at risk of accident in his job as a ship operation executive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Based on the above, the Husband’s counsel argued that the Wife had acted in extreme depravity, and so divorce proceedings ought to be allowed to be instituted within the 3 year bar.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 94 of the Women’s Charter provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">94.—(1)    No writ for divorce is to be filed in the court unless at the date of the filing of the writ 3 years have passed since the date of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court may, upon application being made in accordance with the Family Justice Rules made under section 139, allow a writ to be filed before 3 years have passed on the ground that the case is one of exceptional hardship suffered by the plaintiff or of exceptional depravity on the part of the defendant…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    In determining any application under this section for leave to file a writ before the expiration of 3 years from the date of the marriage, the court is to have regard to the interest of any child of the marriage and to the question whether there is reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said 3 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To succeed in his application, the Husband must show either :</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_i\"></a>(i)     that he has suffered exceptional hardship or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     that the Wife committed exceptional depravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     He must also show that there is no reasonable probability of a reconciliation between him and the Wife before the expiration of the 3-year period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the case of <em>Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0195.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 195</a>, the High Court stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The statutory moratorium of three years is to impress upon married couples that marriage is not an event that one can sign in and out as they fancy. In the meantime, there are alternative remedies and relief in cases of abuse and they include applications for a personal protection order. The aggrieved party may also leave the other party, as this plaintiff has done. The moratorium is intended to hold out the hope of reconciliation – and who is to say that even in extreme cases of abuse, the abuser may not see the error of his or her ways and reconcile with the other?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In terms of evidence, the Husband files a singular piece of evidence: his proposed statement of claim and statement of particulars. He did not exhibit any documents to support or corroborate his allegations. I found it hard to accept that in this day and age, the Husband was not able to adduce any of the texts or the postings that he referred to. This left his case at the status of a bare allegation. Nevertheless, I was conscious that I could not at this stage decide whether the allegations are true. However, it did not mean that I was to accept the evidence uncritically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     With this in mind, I found that the Husband had not shown that his case, even if true, had attained the level of exceptional hardship. This does not deny that, prima facie, he may have sufficient grounds to obtain a divorce based on unreasonable behaviour of the Wife. However, section 94 expressly requires the hardship to be of an exceptional degree. I find that the Husband has failed to show this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Similarly, I found that the Husband failed to show that the Wife committed exceptional depravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I also found that the Husband failed to show that there was no reasonable probability of reconciliation between the Husband and the Wife. The marriage is less than a year old. The parties are in Singapore or Johor Bahru. This fact alone distinguished this case from the facts in <em>Ng Kee Shee v Fu Gaofei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48932-M.xml')\">[2005] SGHC 171</a>, where the High Court held that there was nothing left to reconcile in that case because the Wife had deserted the Husband and returned to China after repeatedly avowing never to return. I found that the facts of the present case were closer to those in of <em>Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence</em> instead, and that there remained, however residual or unlikely, a probability of reconciliation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In view of the above, I could only conclude that the Husband did not show that he suffered from exceptional hardship, nor that the Wife had committed exceptional depravity, nor that there was no reasonable probability of reconciliation. I therefore dismissed the application.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Variation of Maintenance for Child – Variation of Division of Assets"],"date":"2024-01-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2465 of 2021 (Summons No 966 of 2023)","title":"WSG v WSF","citation":"[2024] SGFC 7","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30975-SSP.xml","counsel":["David Nayar (David Nayar and Associates) for the Plaintiff","Michelle Elizabeth Woodworth, Yap Tong, Hitomi (Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2024-02-01T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>WSG v WSF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WSG <em>v</em> WSF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30975-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 7</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2465 of 2021 (Summons No 966 of 2023)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 January 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kenneth Yap </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> David Nayar (David Nayar and Associates) for the Plaintiff; Michelle Elizabeth Woodworth, Yap Tong, Hitomi (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the Defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WSG — WSF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of Maintenance for Child</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of Division of Assets</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 January 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff in this case (hereinafter referred to as the Mother) sought to enforce maintenance arrears against the Defendant (hereinafter referred to as the Father) in MSS 659/2023. In response, the Father filed FC/SUM 996/2023 for a downward variation of child maintenance and mortgage payments under the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both applications were consolidated to be heard together, with the Father’s application for variation proceeding first. In his application, the Father sought a reduction of his monthly payments from $10,700.00 to $1,000.00. On 4 October 2023, I allowed the variation in part, reducing the total monthly quantum payable by the Father from $10,700.00 to $8,800.00. Parties were then given time to consider amicable resolution of the Mother’s enforcement application in MSS 659/2023. As they were unable to resolve matters, the variation decision was finalised on 17 October 2023 with costs of $2,000.00 (all-in) awarded in favour of the Mother. The Mother’s enforcement application proceeded to trial thereafter and is still ongoing at the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Dissatisfied with the outcome of his application, the Father filed the present appeal against the variation order on 26 October 2023. I had earlier provided the parties with brief grounds on 4 October 2023. I now set out the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties were married on 8 August 2011. Ten years later, the Mother filed for divorce on 21 May 2021. Parties agreed to settle, and Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was entered into by consent on 14 July 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There is one child of the marriage, aged 11 years and attending Primary 5 at the time of hearing (henceforth referred to as “the Child”). The Father has two other children: an 18 year old son from his first marriage (“Child B”), and a 2 year old daughter (“Child C”) born outside of wedlock in June 2021. The Mother does not have any other children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As part of the divorce proceedings, the parties reached an agreement on ancillary matters. Interim Judgment was entered into by consent on 14 July 2021 and judgment was made final on 18 October 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Under Order 3(a) of the IJ, the parties were granted joint custody, with shared care and control of the Child. Although the IJ specifies that the Child would be under the Mother’s care from Sunday 8.00 pm to Friday 8.00 pm, and under the Father’s care from Friday 8.00 pm to Sunday 8.00, in practice, parties resided in the same household after divorce until an incident on 30 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The relevant financial terms of the IJ are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Order 3(c)(a):</b> The Mother retains all rights, title and interest in the Scotts Property and the Father waives all rights and claims to the same, provided that he “shall be entitled to reside at the Scotts Property for as long as he wishes until the property is sold”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Order 3(c)(b):</b> For as long as Child A is attending his present primary school, the Mother shall not sell the Scotts Property without the Father’s express consent. Upon the sale of the Scotts Property, the Mother shall use the sale proceeds of the Scotts Property for the sole purpose of purchasing another property in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Order 3(c)(c):</b> Once the Child completes his education at his present primary school, the Mother would be at liberty to rent out the Scotts Property. She would not need the Father’s consent to sell the Scotts Property. The Father’s obligation to pay towards the mortgage and MCST fees of the Scotts Property would cease only when the Scotts Property was rented out or sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Order 3(f)(a):</b> The Mother would retain the sum of $612,080.00 in her UOB Bank Account, of which $500,000.00 would be held on trust for the Child to be utilised towards the child’s university education and related expenses, with the balance (if any) being applied towards the purchase of a home for the Child or towards starting a business for the Child.

Scotts Property, until the occurrence of an unfortunate incident on 30 March 2022. On that evening, the Mother had brought her friend, a gym instructor, to the master bedroom of the Scotts Property. The Father returned and discovered the gym instructor disrobed in the Mother’s bedroom. An altercation ensued, which ended with the Father hitting the gym instructor on the head with a wine bottle. The police were called and the Father was arrested. After the Father’s arrest, the Mother changed the lock to the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022. The Father was not able to reside at the Scotts Property thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Arising from the incident, the Father was charged and convicted with a criminal offence, and was sentenced to serve a short detention order.

obligations was premised on two grounds. First, he claimed that there was a material change in circumstances due to an increase in expenses that had resulted in his total outgoings exceeding his income (“the First Ground”). Secondly, he sought to rely on his eviction from the Scotts Property on 30 March 2022 as a material change that justified a rescission of his obligation to pay $5,700 towards the mortgage and MCST fees (“the Second Ground”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     With respect to the Father’s First Ground, the gist of his arguments were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There had been an increase in his expenses of $18,465.50 arising from (i) increased mortgage financing for his Marina Way Property held in his sole name, (ii) payment of rental for an alternative residence following his eviction from the Scotts Property, (iii) a rise in property tax for the Marina Way Property, and (iv) the need to make maintenance payments for the Child following the depletion of the ring-fenced funds. These components collectively amounted to $27,507.50<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, and with his other monthly expenses amounting to $6,607.15, as well as personal monthly expenses of $3,050 per month, far exceeded his salary of $8,000.00 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There had been an increase in his expenses in relation to the Father’s children outside of the marriage. The Father attributed the increase to (i) his obligation under a Consent Order entered on 18 November 2022 with his former wife to fully pay for Child B’s university education in Australia, the costs of which amounted to $$4,446.00 each month, and (ii) an increase in Child C’s expenses by about $1,000 each month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While the Father’s income had increased from $10,400.00 at the time of the IJ to $16,097.00 at present, the Mother’s income had increased more substantially from $8,000.00 to $15,000.00 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There has been a depletion of the Father’s savings because of an investment-related fraud by a Maybank remisier, which resulted in a loss to the Father of USD $1,200,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In addition, the Father submits that the maintenance sum of $5,000.00 for the Child is not justified, and he estimates that schooling, tuition and food costs for the Child only amount to $2,044.00 per month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     With respect to the Second Ground, the Father submits that his eviction from the Scotts Property amounted to a radical and material change in circumstances which released him from his obligation to contribute $5,700 towards the mortgage every month. He objected to the characterisation of this sum as part of child maintenance, and emphasised that his obligation under the IJ was to pay this sum only if the Scotts Property was not rented out or sold.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s Submissions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother took the position that the Consent Order was crafted to safeguard the living arrangements for the Child near his present school, and that the residence of the Father at the Scotts Property was therefore irrelevant. She submits that the component of $5,700 is for the Child’s housing needs, and formed part of the Father’s agreed maintenance obligations towards the Child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. They should not therefore be varied as there was no change to the needs of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In response to the Father’s assertion that his financial standing had changed adversely, the Mother advanced the following arguments:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s expenses were already far more than this alleged income at the time of the Consent Order and his lifestyle and spending habits suggest that he is not in financial difficulty. Notably, at the time of the IJ, the Father’s alleged total monthly expenses of $22,124.20 were already more than twice his income of $10,400. Further, the alleged increases in the Father’s expenditure were anticipated and/or foreseeable by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It was incorrect for the Father to count the sum of $10,700.00 towards the alleged increase in his expenses to support his assertion of a change in circumstances, as the Father knew he would have to pay this sum once the ring-fenced monies were depleted<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The increase in the mortgage payable on the Marina Way Property (from $8,642.00 at the time of the IJ to $12,133.00 at present, i.e. an increase of $3,491.00) is offset by the increase in the Father’s rental income from renting out the Marina Way Property (from $6,300.00 at the time of the IJ to $9,300.00 per month presently, i.e. an increase of $3,000.00)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father had already been incurring rental costs at the time of the Consent Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.

In particular, the Father owns 45% of the shareholding of TFP, which had a sum of $1,787,273.96 in its bank accounts as at June 2023. The Father also owns 51% of the shareholding of EUTSPL, a company which was incorporated on 10 August 2022 after the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Mother further invited the court to draw an adverse inference against the Father for a failure to provide full and frank disclosure of his financial resources and means, particular in respect of the proceeds from the sale of TPL<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The Mother also submitted that the Father’s lifestyle and spending habits suggested that he was still capable of sustaining his payment obligations. In the month of November 2022 alone, the Father’s expenses on food and beverage and entertainment related items from his American Express credit card statements alone amounted to $10,546.09, which was almost equivalent to the monthly maintenance of $10,700.00. The Father was also able to take overseas to Taiwan and Thailand in short succession for leisure and golf as recently as April 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_i\"></a>(i)     The Father’s obligation to pay the entirety of Child B’s overseas education and associated expenses was voluntarily and irresponsibly incurred. The Father’s maintenance obligations towards Child B had previously stood at $1,250.00 per month, and he had entered into a court order by consent in FC/SUM 2651/2022 to be responsible for Child B’s overseas education. The Mother noted that this consent order was dated 18 November 2022, some 6 months after the Father had begun to default on his payments obligations in May 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_j\"></a>(j)     The Father’s obligation to maintain Child C was already considered under the IJ, as Child C was born on 27 June 2021 and the IJ was entered into on 14 July 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_k\"></a>(k)     The Father’s change in circumstances, if any, had been self-induced<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_l\"></a>(l)     The Father’s move out of the Scotts Property was self-induced.

In this regard, sections 118 and 119 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provide as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary orders for maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>118</b>.    The court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance… on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made … where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreements for maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>119</b>.    Subject to section 116, the court may at any time and from time to time vary the terms of any agreement as to maintenance made between Father and wife … where it is satisfied that there has been any material change in the circumstances and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any such agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Section 127 of the Women’s Charter further provides that Parts 8 and 9 of the Women’s Charter apply, with the necessary modifications, to a maintenance order for children made pursuant to divorce proceedings. This requires the Court to consider the following two provisions under Part 8 relating to spousal and child maintenance. First, section 72(1) gives the Court the power to vary or rescind any maintenance order, provides further elucidation for the test for variation as set out in s118:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Rescission and variation of order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and <b><em>on proof of a change in the circumstances</em></b> of that person, his wife or child, or for <b><em>other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</em></b>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit. <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Next, section 73 emphasises that any variation of child maintenance must be reasonable and must be in the welfare of the child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to vary agreement for maintenance of child</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>73</b>.    The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child … notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The power to vary an order relating to division of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The power of the Court to vary an order relating to the division of assets is found in section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>112.</b>—(1)    The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a>, it was noted by the Court of Appeal that at [24] that “the invocation of s 112(4) is justified where a court order is unworkable to begin with, or has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances which have arisen”. Such new circumstances would have to change the situation such that the implementation of the order is radically different from what was intended, at [25]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We are of the view that where new circumstances have emerged since the order was made which so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which is radically different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability, and the court would make, inter alia, the necessary variations to deal with such unworkability…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     One significant difference between the variation of an order relating to division of assets as opposed to child maintenance is that in the latter, regard should be had to the welfare of the child when considering issues in relation to maintenance. This was underscored by the Court of Appeal in <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a>, at [48]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the court is considering the issue of division of assets, the focus is on the <em>proprietary entitlements</em> of the parties to the marriage <em>inter se</em>. No interests of third parties like children are at stake. It therefore stands to reason that any agreement which has been freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties upon legal advice should be almost determinative of the outcome and the role of the court is greatly circumscribed: it is there only to ensure that the agreement would not effect injustice. In contrast, where the court is considering the issue of maintenance for the child, the focus of the court’s inquiry is the <em>financial needs</em> of the child – a <em>third party</em> who had no say in the conclusion of the agreement but whose interests are nevertheless directly implicated. In this context, the court assumes a more prominent custodial role and the overriding objective is that the welfare of the child must be safeguarded and adequate provision must be made for his/her upkeep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant factors in considering whether a material change justifies a variation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Two further observations are apposite when the Court considers whether to vary the orders relating to maintenance or division of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The first is that the courts generally attach significant weight to an agreement relating to financial matters in a divorce. In <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19150-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 41</a>, Chao Hick Tin JA noted at [31] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is a matter of common sense and justice that the existence of an agreement for the division of matrimonial assets in contemplation of divorce should be accorded due weight when the court decides what is a just and equitable distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">His Honour went on to observe, at [32], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Simply put, if parties have reached an agreement on division which they have <em>freely and advisedly entered into</em>, then it is surely “just and equitable” that the terms of this agreement are adhered to. We recognise that the distributions accepted in a postnuptial agreement will not necessarily reflect what the parties would have received had they gone to court for adjudication. However, this can hardly be surprising. All settlement agreements, no less marital agreements, are a product of compromise. The distributions entered into reflect the benefits, both tangible (in terms of saved legal costs) and intangible (the psychological value of repose), of dispute avoidance. Parties often accept less than what they would otherwise properly be entitled to in order to find closure. This is entirely understandable, and it is also to be expected and respected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the context of agreements on maintenance, the court would also be circumspect in varying an order reached by consent, as parties are in the best position to appreciate their own financial circumstances, and may have made compromises or concessions that were pre-conditions to settlement. This was observed by the court in <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<em>UNC</em>”) at [24(b) – (e)]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    In this regard, agreements for maintenance are different from general orders for maintenance as the terms reached were those constructed by the parties themselves. The parties are in the best position to appreciate their own circumstances, and to decide what allowances or concessions to make.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Given their special position, the proposals and agreements they make carries with it a <em>greater legitimate expectation</em> that they would be fulfilled. It is for this reason why the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a>, in the context of varying of consent orders relating to matrimonial assets, stated (at [25]) that any new circumstances must “radically change” the original intent of the order for it to be aried. This underscores the seriousness the courts place in agreements reached between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    In the premises, parties are, in my view, expected to ensure that they have done the necessary due diligence to ensure a reasonable level of robustness to their promises…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)    Accordingly, if a party had constructed the agreement such that he or she were placed in a situation where any change would affect the ability to satisfy the terms of the agreement, this Court should be more circumspect in granting the variation sough after. A party who knowingly enters into a bad or unsustainable bargain cannot subsequently seek refuge from this Court to seek absolution for their own failures. To allow this would make a mockery of parties’ legitimate interests in reaching an amicable resolution of their disputes. It would also devalue the oft-overlooked fact that their agreement has now been clothed with the stature and force of a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The second observation I would make is that foreseeable and/or self-induced changes of circumstance would not provide sufficient justification for variation. In the Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore (Foo Siew Fong gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia 2016) (“Law and Practice”), it was noted at [7.4.35] that parties cannot rely on foreseeable changes of circumstance to justify variation of an agreement:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">What constitutes material change justifying a variation of an agreement for maintenance necessitates a comparison of the present circumstances of the parties with the circumstances when they entered in the agreement. Where an <b>upcoming material change was expected to happen and known to the parties at the time of making the agreement</b>, the party agreeing to pay cannot make use of such a change in circumstances to later seek variation of the maintenance agreement. [<em>Emphasis added</em>].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Where the material change is self-induced, a variation would similarly be disallowed. In the Court of Appeal decision of <em>CDV v CDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25101-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 100</a>, Steven Chong JA noted at [88] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the context of an application to vary a maintenance order, it is well established that a variation will be disallowed if the adverse change is circumstances is self-induced (see, for example, <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> at [24]; <em>VCF v VCG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23778-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 120</a> at [58]; and <em>UWY v UWZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23246-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 60</a> at [22]). It seems to us that there is no reason why this principle should not apply in a similar manner in the context of an application to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets. Where the order becomes unworkable due to a self-induced change in circumstances, the court should not permit a variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In a similar vein, it was pointed out in <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<b><em>UNC</em></b>”) at [23] that “if a change was foreseeable or self-induced, this would not justify a variation”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In essence, it can be discerned that for a variation of maintenance to be granted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Applicant cannot rely on a circumstance or fact that existed at the time the agreement was constructed between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the change relied upon was foreseeable or self-induced, it would not justify a variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant has to prove a change in the circumstances that is “material” and in the context of any variation of the maintenance of a child, it has to be reasonable and in the welfare of the child to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Bearing in mind the parties’ positions and the relevant law, I considered the following issues in arriving at my decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Father’s financial situation presents a material a change of circumstances that warrants a downward variation from the monthly child maintenance of $5,000.00;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Father’s eviction from the Scotts Property constitutes a material of change in circumstance that justifies a downward variation of the monthly mortgage payment and MCST fee of $5,700.00; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether any downward variation should be backdated to May 2022, which is the first date of default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Whether the change in the Father’s financial position constitutes a material change in circumstances that justifies a variation of the child maintenance orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Having reviewed the evidence and submissions, I disagreed with the Father’s First Ground that the rise in his expenses justified a downward revision of his monthly payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The first observation I would make is that the Father’s net income had risen since the IJ. The Father had two sources of income, being salary from TFP, which had risen from $4,000.00 to $8,000.00 over the material period, and rental returns from his Marina Way Property. With regard to the latter, while mortgage repayments had risen amidst higher interest rates, this was mitigated by a corresponding rise in rental. From the table below, it can be seen the Father saw an increase of $3,3134.50 in his net income, from $1,358.00 at the point of the IJ to $4,492.50 at present:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"21.5756848630274%\"><col width=\"25.0949810037992%\"><col width=\"23.995200959808%\"><col width=\"29.3341331733653%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>At the time of the Consent Order</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Current</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Income</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Salary</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4,000.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$8,000.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Rental Income </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$6,400.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$9,300.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expenses</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mortgage, Marina Way (H’s sole property)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$8,642.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$12,133.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tenanted Periods: </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">27 March 2021 – 26 March 2023; 14 April 2023 – current</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Property Tax</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$400</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$674.50</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Net income</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,358.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4,492.50</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Increase of $3,134.50</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is trite that a material change in expenses <em>per se</em> would not be sufficient to warrant a variation if the applicant has seen a corresponding rise in income. In the Court of Appeal case of <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a>, the father in that case had sought to reduce child maintenance on the basis that educational expenses borne by him had increased significantly following the children’s relocation to the U.K. In declining the variation, Steven Chong JA observed, at [14] and [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.    First, in examining the question of material change in circumstances, the inquiry is not simply whether there has been any material change <em>per se</em> since the Maintenance Order. The change must be sufficiently <em>material</em> such that it is no longer fair to expect the <em>status quo</em> to remain… Here, there is no dispute that the Father’s increase in income significantly outstrips the increase in the children’s educational expenses … No suggestion has been made that the Father is unable to afford the increase in the educational expense and indeed the evidence militates against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15.    Second, the increase in the children’s educational expenses cannot be said to be unforeseeable… The Father must therefore have foreseen that he would have to find means of independently financing the increased educational expenses resulting from the children’s move. There is also no suggestion that the children moving to the UK to pursue their studies was an unexpected and sudden decision. Accordingly, we do not consider the increased educational expenses to constitute a material change of the circumstances under s 118 of the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On the present facts, the phenomenon of an interest rate hike should have been reasonably foreseeable to any property investor. It was incumbent upon the Father to have made provision for such fluctuation, before agreeing to the terms of the consent judgment. In any case, the change was not material as the rise in his income could clearly cover the increased monthly outflow occasioned by the retention of the Marina Way Property. There was therefore no change in circumstance that was sufficiently material to expect a change of the status quo. I would venture to add that, even if the Father had experienced a net loss, there was no explanation as to why he could not sell this non-performing asset in order to reduce his monthly outflow.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn next to consider the increase in maintenance obligations towards Child B and Child C. With regard to Child B, the Father’s maintenance obligations were increased from $1,250.00 per month to $4,446.00, on account of the Father agreeing to a consent judgment dated 18 November 2022 in proceedings brought by his ex-wife to render him solely responsible for cost of university education for Child B in Australia. The Mother argues that this increase is voluntary and self-induced, and was unfair because it apportioned resources to child B even though the Father had been in arrears of his payment obligations for five months at that point. To be fair to the Father, I would not consider the increased expenditure to be self-induced simply because it arose from a consent judgment. By the Father’s explanation, Child B needed to take up overseas education as he was struggling academically at junior college. Nevertheless, I noted that this change of circumstance was foreseeable and could not for that reason justify a variation. Child B was nearly 17 years of age at the point where parties entered into the IJ by consent on 14 July 2021. The need for overseas education would have been foreseeable at that point, and the Father should have provisioned for this accordingly. I would therefore not consider Child B’s university expenses to be sufficiently material to justify a variation for the purposes of s 118 of the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As for Child C, the Father submits that there is a monthly increase of $400 in paediatric costs and $600 in miscellaneous costs for the upkeep of the child. I note that Child C was born in June 2021, one month before the IJ was entered into. Any normal and reasonable costs in relation to the bringing up of a toddler would have been completely foreseeable at that point. The Father has not shown that the costs currently incurred by Child C are in any way unusual or unexpected. These costs likewise cannot justify a downward variation of maintenance for the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I would add that even if expenses had risen for the Father’s other children such that there was a need for financial belt tightening, there was no reason why such austerity should be visited only on the Child of this marriage. It is incumbent upon the Father to manage and balance his obligations towards all his children equally and fairly, and not allocate sacrifices arbitrarily to any particular child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The third change of circumstance the Father seeks to rely on is a depletion of his savings. It was submitted by Counsel for the Father that the Father’s expenses stood at a sum of $46,035.23, far exceeding his disclosed monthly income of $16,097.00, resulting in a monthly deficit of $29,938.23<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. The Father also highlights that his financial position has suffered greatly due to a loss of USD 1,200,000.00 which he suffered due to a fraud perpetrated by his Maybank remisier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I disagreed with the Father’s characterisation that his savings had been depleted for several reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     First, it was clear that he had entered into the IJ on the basis that he would be drawing down on his savings rather than relying on his income to meet his payment obligations. The fact that, following the depletion of the ringfenced sum, he is now out of pocket on a monthly basis cannot <em>ipso facto</em> mean that he is facing financial difficulty. It is incumbent upon the Father to be prudent in financial planning to ensure that he retains sufficient savings to make good on the agreed payments when they materialise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Indeed, as earlier cited, it is clear that a party who “knowingly enters into a bad or unsustainable bargain cannot subsequently seek refuge from (the) Court to seek absolution from their own failures”: see <em>UNC</em> at [24(e)]. Where parties have voluntarily entered into an agreement following negotiations, it is reasonable to assume that the terms entail a reasonable level of contemplation and sustainability. The Court should be wary to disturb the sanctity of such agreement, save where the change in circumstances is not reasonably foreseeable <em>and</em> fidelity to the terms presents a radical departure to the financial standing of the applicant. Hence, on the facts of <em>UNC</em>, the court held that the father who entered into a consent order to pay maintenance and relied on his savings to fund such payments could not later rely on the depletion of those savings as a material change of circumstance, at [27]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In this regard, I was of the view that the depletion of the sale proceeds was not a material change in circumstance at the time he made the agreement to the present time. On the plaintiff’s own miscalculations, he was already dipping into the sale proceeds <em>before any change to his salary</em>. In other words, the depletion was not directly linked to the plaintiff’s reduction in salary. The depletion of the sale proceeds was not an event which the plaintiff could not have foreseen. On the contrary, the plaintiff knew or would have known that the depletion of sale proceeds was a real eventuality in the future. The fact that the plaintiff was required to dip into the sale proceeds at the outset underscored the unsustainability of his agreement under the IJ, and his financial management as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Second, the Father’s total asset worth is not entirely clear and it is therefore difficult to conclude that his asset base is near depletion. He was by all accounts a successful businessman and had on 3 March 2020 sold the shares in his company, TPL to Under Armour Europe B.V., for which he received approximately US$5,600.000 (equivalent to about S$8,000,000). In his reply affidavit, the Father accounted for these funds as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had invested the proceeds in businesses that the Mother runs, with all proceeds debited into his Singapore UOB account;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had bought the Mother gifts over the years;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Investments were made toward the end of 2020 and the restaurant business that the Mother now runs began operations in December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Prior to the sale of the business, the father had transferred money to the Mother to buy a property in Shanghai, and had transferred other assets to her and made monthly payments to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     These responses lack specificity, and no documentary evidence was provided to trace the whereabouts of the $8 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. At the hearing, the Father’s counsel sought leave to file a further affidavit to address this issue, but this was declined as the hearing had already proceeded in earnest and in my view, the Father should have taken the opportunity early on to respond to and clarify this averment in his reply affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I would add that the Mother had requested that the Court draw an adverse inference for the Father’s failure to provide full and frank disclosure in relation to the proceeds of the sale of TPL. I declined to go to such an extent, because no discovery application had been filed by the Mother following voluntary disclosure by the Father. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the Father had done himself no favours by failing to fully account how he had managed to deplete the S$8 million over a period of about two years from the receipt of the funds in March 2020 to May 2022, when he first started to default on payments. The evidential burden lies with the Father to demonstrate how such a substantial sum of money was no longer available, and the lack of a satisfactory explanation casts significant doubt on his claim that his savings had been depleted by the time of the variation application on 29 March 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Further, it appears that the Father has other assets that can be applied towards his payment obligations. He owns 45% of the shares in TFP and is in the board of directors of TFP<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. He is also a director of EUTSPL, a company incorporated following the Consent Order, in which he is a 51% shareholder<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. There is no satisfactory explanation of why the Father considers himself to be impecunious despite his substantial shareholdings in both companies, which are going concerns. Turning to other assets, the Father could also choose to liquidate the Marina Way Property in order to improve liquidity until his business fortunes improve. He also owns other valuable assets, in the form of three motor vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Coupe and Harley Davidson Roadster, which are fully paid up<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, and a Mercedes-Benz E200 AMG Line, which has an outstanding loan of $74,704.00.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> There is no indication why any of these assets could not be sold to cover the increased expenses faced by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Third, I turn to the Father’s reliance on his loss to a fraudulent trader in the sum of USD 1.2 million as a reason for his financial difficulties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. While this was an unfortunate incident, it should be remembered that an investor incurs risk for return and must perform the necessary due diligence to safeguard his investment. The Father had acted on his own volition by choosing to invest in products purportedly offered by the remisier. It would be inequitable for him to now evade his obligations under the IJ to cover his incurred losses. Further, given that there are gaps in the asset position of the Father, it is difficult to ascertain the precise impact that the fraud had on his overall financial standing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Fourth, I find the Father’s spending patterns to be in conflict with his purported impecuniosity. A snapshot of his personal expenses on a single credit card in the month of November 2022 shows that he had spent $39,626.61 on food and beverage, entertainment and luxury items in the month of November 2022 alone, despite having been in arrears since May 2020. The extracted entries from his credit card is tabulated as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p> <table align=\"left\"

This list of transactions is non-exhaustive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Apart from the above, other personal expenses by the Father include the purchase of wine as a gift at the 1855 The Bottle Shop, Singapore on 24 January 2023, amounting to $653.00 on 24 January 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. He had also purchased three gift watches worth $9,650.00, $12,040.00 and $7,900 on 11 November 2022, 19 November 2022 and 22 April 2023 respectively. In his reply to interrogatories, the Father confirmed that one watch was purchased on behalf of a friend from Malaysia, one watch was a gift to his ex-staff, and another was purchased for his own investment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. The Father has also clarified that he had made a purchase of a limited-edition whisky for a sum of $125,000.00 as an investment on behalf of EUTSPL, by taking out a shareholder’s loan<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is particularly telling that the Father had seen fit to spend large sums on luxury items, entertainment and gifts, while claiming that his savings had been depleted by increasing expenditure and his loss to fraud of USD 1.2 million. Taken in totality, I find that the Father’s spending habits and lifestyle patterns are not those of somebody who was as impecunious as he claimed to be (see in this regard, <em>TOF v TOE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26792-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 2 SLR 976</a>, at [55]). For this reason, I do not consider there to be any material change due to depleted savings that would justify downward revision. I further did not find any reason to doubt that the continued payment of $5,000.00 in child maintenance would be to the benefit of the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     At this point, I would add a footnote to address the Father’s argument that his contributions be reduced on account of the Mother’s income having increased from $8,000.00 to $15,000.00 per month. To my mind, the Father’s level of discretionary expenditure revealed above clearly puts paid to this argument. If he can spend nearly $40,000 in one month on luxuries and entertainment, then it cannot lie in his mouth to require the Mother to shoulder a greater share of the maintenance and mortgage sums in his stead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I accordingly found the Father’s First Ground that there was a shortfall between his expenses and income due to rising expenses to be insufficient to reduce his maintenance payments. The Father still possesses considerable resources, and has yet to demonstrate that his cash and assets had depleted to such an extent that it would be inequitable for him to continue his monthly payments. To succeed in this or any subsequent variation application, the Father has to show that his resources are exhausted to the point that it is inequitable to expect him to honour his obligations under the agreed terms of the IJ. He cannot, merely two years after the consent judgment, expect the Mother to share his financial burdens for the sole purpose of preserving his current asset base.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Whether the Father’s eviction from the Scotts Property constitutes a material change in circumstances that justifies a variation of the mortgage payments </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Turning to the Father’s Second Ground, I did find greater traction with his argument that his eviction from the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022 justified a reduction of the mortgage payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Father was effectively denied his licence to stay at the premises when the Mother changed the locks to the Scotts Property on 4 April 2022. This was a breach of the terms of Order 3(c)(a) of the IJ, and I did not find it to be justified on the basis of safety considerations. While the Father’s initial reaction in the altercation was wrong, he had been convicted of a criminal charge and had paid the price for his actions. I did not see that that his singular action necessitated a complete eviction from the property. Parties were still on talking terms thereafter and could have established the necessary boundaries that were required for divorced partners to stay under the same roof for the sake of the child. For example, a clear demarcation of living areas and the installation of room locks could have ensured that proper boundaries would be observed between the parties. I also note that the Mother did not see fit to apply for a personal protection order against the Father in the aftermath of the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It follows that I do not accept the Mother’s argument that the Father’s eviction was self-induced, i.e. that his eviction was necessitated by his behaviour on the evening of 30 March 2022. The Mother also seeks to resist the variation on the basis that the payment of $5,700 should be characterised as part of child maintenance, and as the needs of the child had not changed, there would be no justification to reduce the payment even if the Father no longer enjoyed the use of the property. However, I did not find this categorisation to be accurate. Under the IJ, the Father’s obligation to pay $5,700 towards mortgage repayments and MCST fees would terminate when the Scotts Property was rented out or sold (per Order 3(c)(c) and 3(f)(a)(iii)(b)), and it was further provided that the Mother could unilaterally sell the Scotts Property after the Child ceases to attend his present primary school (Clause 3(c)(b)). Accordingly, the obligation to pay $5,700 was not envisaged as a contribution towards the child’s maintenance. It is apparent that the preservation of the Father’s right to stay in the Scotts Property (despite a transfer of title to the Mother in the division of assets) was designed to provide continuity for the child to reside near his primary school, and to facilitate shared care and control by both parents under the same roof post-divorce for this limited period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Instead, I was of the view that the payment of $5,700 represented the Father’s obligation to pay the imputed rental for the family nucleus to continue residing at the Scotts Property during the Child’s primary school years. That being the case, I did not agree that the Father’s eviction justified the termination of his obligation to pay in entirety. The consent judgment did not specifically provide that the Father’s right to stay was a condition precedent of his payment. Nevertheless, as the Father no longer receives the benefit of living in the Scotts Property, it is equitable for the mortgage payment obligation to be pro-rated accordingly. I therefore apportioned the mortgage payment in equal shares between the three family members, and determined that while the Father should be released from paying his share of the mortgage payment, he should continue to pay two thirds of the mortgage payment for the continued benefit of the Wife and the Child. Hence, the mortgage payment would be reduced by a third from $5,700 to $3,800, and consequentially, the term guaranteeing the Father’s entitlement to reside in the Scotts Property (under clause 3(c)(a)) would be deleted from the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     For completeness, I did consider the Father’s argument that his alternative rental cost of $4,000.00 a month should be taken into consideration in the downward variation. I would simply point out that the loss of his right to reside as one of three family members in the Scotts Property did not necessitate the need to rent an entire apartment for himself. The reduction of $1,700.00 in his payment obligations would be sufficient to allow him to find shared accommodation in another equivalent property. I accordingly did not adjust the pro-ration on account of this argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Whether the variation should be backdated </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Father had sought for any variation of the terms of the IJ to be backdated to the 30 March 2022 incident. I declined to do so for the reason that the Father was aware of but did not seek to vary the IJ until one year later on 29 March 2023. I did not see why the Father could not have filed for variation earlier, given that he had by his own account experienced financial difficulties that led to default on the payments since May 2022. Further, to retrospectively backdate the reduced sum may unduly prejudice the Mother. For this reason, I declined to backdate the variation, and directed that the reduced sum of $3,800 for the mortgage repayment should apply from the date of the application on 29 March 2023. The reduced sum would thus take effect for payments from 1 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     With respect to costs, Counsel for the Father submitted that parties bear their own costs on the basis that the Father had succeeded in two out of the four prayers that he had sought<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, whilst Counsel for the Mother sought costs of $2,500.00 and $1,722.00 in disbursements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. Counsel for the Mother noted that while the Father had succeeded in varying the mortgage payment, the Court had only granted a reduction of less than 20% of the total payment obligation, which was significantly less than the Father’s position to reduce more than 90% of the total payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Given that the final outcome was significantly nearer to the Mother’s position, I moderated the full measure of costs and awarded $2,000.00 (all-in) in favour of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The orders made in relation to the Father’s summons for variation in FC/SUM 996/2023 stand as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Interim Judgment dated 14<sup>th</sup> July 2021 be varied by amending the sum of “S$5,700.00” in Order 3(f)(a)(iii)(b) to “S$3,800.00”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Defendant shall pay the amended sum of S$3,800.00 pursuant to Order 3(f)(a)(iii) from 1 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Order 3(c)(a) be amended to delete the phrase, “PROVIDED ALWAYS that the Defendant shall be entitled to reside at the Scotts Property for as long as he so wishes until the property is sold.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Costs of $2,000.00 (all-in) be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>HA1, [10];

After a hearing, I ordered the Father to pay to the Mother a monthly sum of $1,000 for each child as well as 50% of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father appeals against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Mother and the Father are undergoing divorce proceedings between each other. They have 2 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The children are a pair of twins aged 3 years old. They are in preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2022, the Mother filed divorce proceedings against the Father in Dxxx/2022. In response, the Father filed a counterclaim against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother and Father were living separately. The matrimonial home was sold, and the Mother went to live with another man. The Mother has a third child, which is not a child of the Father. The 2 children in question are living with her on most days, and with the Father from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother filed the present summons for maintenance of the children on 12 April 2023. In her complaint form in support of her application, the Mother claimed $3,508.31 for each child. The case came for mention on 22 May 2023, and there was no settlement between the parties. Directions were given to them to submit their documents and to return for a further mention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the meantime, the divorce proceedings separately underwent mediations in the Court. On 22 June 2023, there was an agreement on some matters, but when the present maintenance summons came before me, the parties disputed about the agreement. The Father claimed that interim maintenance for the children was agreed to be $300 a month for each child and half of the children’s school fees. The Mother claimed that there was no resolution or agreement on the children’s monthly maintenance, but only an agreement that their school fees would be shared with the Father equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the time of the hearing of the maintenance case before me in October 2023, there was as yet no interim judgment dissolving the couple’s marriage, nor was there any consent order on any ancillary issue entered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Mother argued that the Father ought to pay $1,200 a month for each child. This is in addition to the already agreed half of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father’s response was that he ought to pay $300 a month instead, in addition to the agreed half of school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Issues to be determined</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether there was an agreement between the parties during the mediation of Dxxx/2022, that the Father was to pay $300 a month for the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     What were the reasonable expenses of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     What share of the children’s maintenance ought to be borne by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The agreement alleged by the Father was not evidenced by anything other than his allegation. One would expect that such an agreement would be evidenced by letters from his lawyer, but the Father did not show any such evidence. Neither was there a consent order to reflect such an agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I found that on a balance of probabilities, the Father did not prove the existence of such an agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the hearing before me, the Mother claimed that the children’s expenses were $2,000 each (Notes of Evidence, Page 12, line 2). She asked for the Father to contribute $1,200 for each child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father argued that the Mother was inflating what she claimed as expenses. He argued that $300 for each child was fair as he was paying more in terms of school fees and enrichment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The law does not require that every item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as in a reimbursement exercise. Important factors in determining the children’s maintenance are their needs and the financial capacity of the parents to provide for them – <u>UEB v UEC</u> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother was an assistant project accounting manager. Her monthly income is $7,300. She had some credit card with only a few hundred dollars of debt each. As she has an additional child which is not the Father’s, and she spends several hundred dollars on the expenses of the said child. I was conscious that the Father did not have to contribute to the expenses of this child. The Mother presently lives in her partner’s flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father is a finance manager. His monthly income was $7,373. He did not have any debts. He lived with his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I found that both the Mother and the Father had incomes of roughly $7,000 a month each. They were both well-educated and in stable employments. They had equal earning capacities and equal means to pay towards the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Taking into account the children’s needs and the parents’ financial capacities, I accept that each child’s monthly expense was $2,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I therefore found that the Father ought to bear half of the children’s expenses, or $1,000 a month for each child, totalling $2,000 a month for their maintenance. I also found that this amount was well within his means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For the foregoing reasons, I ordered that the Father bear half of the monthly expenses of each child, at $1,000 each. As already agreed by the parties, I ordered that the Father bear half of the children’s school fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother did not request for the maintenance order to be backdated, so I made no such order.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Custody – care and control","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife","Family Law – Maintenance – Husband"],"date":"2024-01-26","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 399 of 2022","title":"WAH v WAG","citation":"[2024] SGFC 6","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30974-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in person","Ms Hing Wei Yuen Angelina and Mr Denny Lin DianYan (Integro Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2024-01-31T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>WAH v WAG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WAH <em>v</em> WAG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">D 399 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">26 January 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chia Wee Kiat </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in person; Ms Hing Wei Yuen Angelina and Mr Denny Lin DianYan (Integro Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WAH — WAG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Custody</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">care and control</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Husband</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 January 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff (the “Husband”) and the defendant (the “Wife”) were married on 4 February 2018.

This is an application, which, according to the Husband, “relates to parents keeping each other updated reasonably quickly when E is unwell”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As the AM orders are final orders (see <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [9] &amp; [16])), SUM 1112 was considered holistically under the AM hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In broad terms, the Husband is seeking joint custody, care and control of E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Husband wants E to be within the care and control of one parent from Saturday 9pm to Wednesday morning while the other parent will have the remaining time with E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband says that the OSG order has been intact since 24 November 2021. Approximately 18 months thereon, he has not missed one access session. This amounts to approximately 72 weekends. There were 5 weekends where access was denied because the Wife deemed E ill.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband says that even though the Wife has been tacitly alienating E from him,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> he has bonded well with E.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband says that E has expressed that he wants to spend more time with him. E has informed the Husband that he wants the Husband to pick him up and drop him off at school like other fathers who drop and pick up his friends. The Husband says that he too wants to be a part of E’s school life as it is and will continue to be a significant influence in E’s life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband acknowledges that both parents share a strong love for E. The Husband says that he is a sole proprietor and can manage his time accordingly while the Wife appears to still be able to work from home. The Husband says that both have a support system that supplements their immediate care giving abilities.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband says that the two nights of access spanning the weekends has not disrupted E’s development and there are no adverse reports by the Wife from the school that E is unable to cope. On the contrary, E is growing steadily at school and has become focused since the beginning of 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband says that the court can put in place several orders to facilitate cooperative co-parenting<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and should not allow the Wife to use acrimony for the self-serving position to prolong sole care and control and minimize progressive co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband says that he does not seek to reverse care and control as such a request may be too drastic for the Wife to bear, given her emotional attachment to E. However, to not make changes to the care and control facet of the interim orders would effectively reward the Wife and embolden her behaviour towards co-parenting, thereby depriving the child of what is in his best interests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s detailed proposals for access are set out at paragraph 4 of his Written Submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Wife’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife says that after the OSG order, she has been doing her utmost to abide by the orders. As such, the framework set out in the OSG order has been working relatively well under the circumstances in supporting the child’s safety, well-being and development. The OSG order has provided a firm and secure scaffold for the child’s growth under her care and control as the primary caregiver of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife is not in favour of shared care and control. She explains that the marriage has been extremely acrimonious, with legal proceedings lasting much longer than the length of the marriage itself. During the marriage, she was always the first one to want to resolve the issue, try to talk things out calmly and be prepared to forgive and forget. Even after the marriage had broken down, the Wife continued being the one trying various ways to urge the Husband to minimise acrimony. The Wife says that the Husband would case-build to show a “Sterling outlook” in court litigation while giving her “hell” by continually making harassing calls and emails during his access time so that he can turn round and accuse her of not responding to him or not co-parenting with him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife says that the Husband would openly quote excerpts of Court Order and Grounds of Decision where it suits him to intimidate, bully and humiliate her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife says that the Husband has been filing numerous applications to prolong litigation and increase legal fees for the Wife, and has refused to resolve matters amicably.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> For example, the Husband has sought to impose extremely prescriptive orders in SUM 1112<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and refused to return the child after access so as to put the Wife under duress to get the Wife to agree to his demands.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife says that she, on the other hand, has been doing her utmost to put the past behind her and parent the child as best as she can. She has been doing her utmost to comply with the Court’s orders, despite it being extremely challenging.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife says that the child was often returned back (and often late) from his access from the Husband sick, resulting in the Wife having to bear the aftermath caregiving, which adversely affects the rest of the weekdays under the Wife’s care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife says that the Husband is busy with work, and does not have support from his family members. The child is young and susceptible to falling sick. The refusal of the Husband to acknowledge this, and his constant clamoring for more time with the child as a matter of right, is not in the interests of the child, or the co-parenting relationship with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife says that while she has been trying her best efforts to continually affirm joint custody, this is not the case for the Husband. The Husband’s conduct has deeply eroded any trust she has left, and instead of repairing it, the Husband continues to ravage through whatever little of it is left.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife submits that given parties’ relationship is highly acrimonious, it is clearly not in the child’s best interests that shared care and control is ordered in this case. This is especially so given the Husband’s inability to put the child’s interests in the forefront.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Although the Wife proposes that the fundamentals of the OSG order be preserved<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, she feels that the present OSG order effectively limits the time she has with the child during weekends to be on Sunday after 11am. This would effectively only leave time for the child to have lunch, a nap in the afternoon and dinner before turning in for bed at 8pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife says that while the present arrangement might have been applicable when the child was not in school, the arrangement is no longer ideal for the child, now that the child has started pre-school as it gives her very little quality time with the child. The current OSG order as it stands basically only gives the Wife a few hours in the day on Sunday. The Wife says that this is clearly insufficient for the Wife and her extended family to spend quality time with the child over the weekends which will impact the bonding and development of the child over an extended period of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife says that there is no opportunity for the Wife to bring the child for any activities, which may include movies, family get-togethers, with the child’s extended family. The Wife is also unable to schedule any trips to Sentosa, the Zoo, etc. with the child during her time with him. These activities often would be whole-day activities and the child would be extremely tired at the end of the day. The Wife says that most parents would have such activities on a Saturday so that the child can rest and recover and be ready for school on Sunday. The Wife would like to be able to do this once a fortnight.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Wife hopes that the Court would grant the Wife an apportionment of the prime weekend time which includes one non-school night to spend with the child so that the Wife is also given the fundamental opportunity to bond with the child as well as to allow the child to visit with the maternal extended family during the weekends. The Wife is a working mother and weekend time with the child is precious to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     A summary of the Wife’s proposals for access is set out at paragraph 82 of her Written Submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Welfare of child </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It is trite law that in deciding on custody, care and control issues, the court must regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration: see s 125(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The principles of law on custody are well settled. Generally, joint or no custody orders should be made, with sole custody orders being an exception to the rule. As explained by the Court of Appeal <em>in CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the making of joint or no custody orders reminds the parents that the law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the child’s best interest. With the grant of joint or no custody orders, the likelihood of the non-custodial parents being excluded from the child’s life is much reduced. It also encourages the parent who does not reside with the child to continue to play his or her role in joint parenthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In the present case, I am heartened to note that the parties have agreed to joint custody. This is a positive shift from the litigious position taken in the earlier OSG proceedings where the Wife had sought strenuously for a sole custody order: see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [127]). I commend the Wife for taking this positive step towards co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I am also heartened to note that the parties have responded well to the framework set out in the OSG order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I find it especially encouraging to see that the Wife is no longer objecting to overnight access, but seeks only to have an apportionment of the prime weekend time, which is not an unreasonable request by itself. This is a positive development from the intractable position she took in the earlier proceedings: see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [156]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The central issue before me at this ancillary hearing is whether it would be in the best interests of the child for the care arrangement to progress to one of shared care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As noted in <em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 1 SLR 0840.xml')\">[2012] 1 SLR 840</a> (at [9]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances. This is illustrated by two High Court decisions where shared care and control was ordered: in <em>AHJ v AHK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0148.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 148</a> the child would spend Saturdays 8.00pm to Wednesday 11.30am with the mother, and the rest of the week with the father; in <em>AKF v AKG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0225.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 225</a> the same learned judge held that the children would spend alternate fortnights with each parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband has had unsupervised overnight parenting time (from Friday 6pm to Sunday 11am) with the child since June 2022. The Husband would like to seek more parenting time with the child. He has proposed a balanced sharing of parenting time through a half-week arrangement. However, the Wife objects to shared care and control. She has instead proposed for the Husband’s weekend parenting time with the child to be reduced so that she could bond with the child on weekends too.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The primary reason relied upon by the Wife to resist shared care and control is the acrimonious relationship of the parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> She submits as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">70    In the case of <em>TAU v TAT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a></em>, the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong held at [12], that to ignore the realities such as parental conflict, parties’ emotional baggage by imposing shared care and control can do more harm than good. Justice Ong further held at [29] that shared care and control of the child would not be workable because of the acrimonious relationship between the parties as well as their very different parenting styles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">71    In the case of <em>AQL v AQM <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a></em>, the High Court held at [14]-[21] that an order for shared care and control was not in the interests of the child as it would be too disruptive to constancy of routine that the child required and the animosity between the parents and their resulting inability to compromise would also exacerbate the sense of disruption.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     However, I note that in the recent decision of <em>CXR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a> (“<em>CXR v CXQ</em>”), the court made an order of shared care and control notwithstanding the acrimonious relationship of the parties and their inability to co-parent effectively. Debbie Ong JAD explained (at [18]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>I was acutely cognisant of the parties’ acrimonious relationship and their present inability to co-parent effectively.</b> I was equally aware that both parents love C dearly and had been giving their best efforts to care for him and help him cope with his medical condition and learning disabilities, albeit in their own ways. As C was living with both parents in the matrimonial home, he was accustomed to the arrangements and was close to, and dependent on both parents. While there were difficulties in cooperating on matters relating to C in the past few years, the parties were also able to sort out many care aspects including having C travel with his father. C has had the physical presence and care of both parents in his life even after the marriage had broken down. In the circumstances, I was of the view that parties should share care and control of C, but it is crucial that they must have in place a clear routine and structure that would enable C to have a stable and predictable arrangement. This arrangement placed the best interests of C at the forefront.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Quite clearly, the parties’ acrimonious relationship or inability to co-parent effectively are not reasons by themselves to refuse shared care and control. Ultimately, the question to be considered in each case is whether shared care and control would be in the child’s best interests and this must be assessed based on the specific facts of the case. Indeed, this is also clear from a careful reading of <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a>, a case precedent cited by the Wife, where Debbie Ong J (as she then was) said (at [12]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As I have explained above, the legal constructs of custody, care and control, and access are used to support families where the child’s parents have separated. Intact, functioning families do not need such interventions. The ideal state is understandably for a child to be in an intact family where he or she lives with and is lovingly cared for jointly by both parents. Yet, upon the breakdown of a marriage, this is simply no longer fully achievable. The family justice system nevertheless aspires to achieve the ideal state of affairs for the child, or the closest to it possible. But to ignore the realities, including the parental conflict, the parties’ emotional baggage and the new dynamics of the various relationships, and impose in all situations a modified version of the perceived ideal (such as equal-time shared parenting or shared care and control) can do more harm than good. <b>Thus in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife also contends that the child should primarily stay with her due to his established weekday routine, proximity to preschool (five minutes’ walk), and the need to maintain consistency to prepare the child for kindergarten in 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Wife says that night sleep is very important for a growing and developing child. In her view, it is clearly not in the child’s interests to have a shorter sleep time on Thursday night or have a longer commute on Friday mornings just to get to school on time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> If the child does not receive adequate rest on Thursday night, he would be tired and lethargic in his pre-school and this would affect his focus and concentration in school on Friday. Additionally, if the child does not get adequate rest on Thursday night, he may not be able to be punctual for his morning classes/activities on Friday and then this would mean that his development in school would be affected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In the interests of the child, the Wife hopes to avoid constant upheaval in access arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife also says that the current orders as they stand do not allow her and her extended family to spend any quality time with the child over the weekends and this will impact the bonding and development of the child as they will not be able to carry out any activities together over the weekends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The current orders also accord both non-school nights (Friday and Saturday) to the Husband. There is therefore no opportunity for the Wife to equally share in any of the non-school nights. The Wife says that all the nights that she currently has with the child would be school nights where the child would have a full day and be required to rest early in preparation for school the next day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife therefore proposes an equal sharing of the weekends for the child to bond with her and the maternal family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Notably, the Wife did not propose any make up access for the Husband. The effect of the Wife’s proposal is therefore to roll back on the access that has been in place since June 2022 pursuant to the OSG order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my view, the Wife’s contentions overlook the child’s socioemotional development. They do not consider the child’s relationship with the Husband, the importance of shared parenting, and the potential benefits of spending time with both parents for the child’s overall development and well-being. A child-centric arrangement should prioritize the child’s well-being and the opportunity to maintain meaningful relationship with both parents, rather than solely focusing on convenience, routines and the wish of one parent to have more time with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the OSG proceedings, I reminded parties that the child is young and will benefit from regular interaction and close physical contact with both parents. I referred parties to <em>BNT v BNS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0187.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 187</a> where Judith Prakash J noted (at [35(b)]) as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child – there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I also referred to <em>VDZ v VEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25178-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 858</a> where the Court of Appeal noted (at [79]) as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Every child requires love and care from <em>both</em> parents in order to grow up and achieve their fullest potential as balanced individuals</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     At the OSG proceedings, I found that the bond between the Husband and the child needed to be restored and strengthened as the Husband’s physical contact with the child had been adversely affected by the Wife’s action to restrict access. I explained as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The objective evidence shows that the Father has a close relationship with the child. He has been an intimate part of the child’s life since the child was born. The child is familiar with the Father, the paternal family and the environment in Home A. It is not disputed that the Mother left Home A with the child and restricted access to the Father. Whatever her justification may be, the effect of her action is that the physical contact between the Father and the child has been affected. It is the interests of the child that the bond between the Father and the child be restored and strengthened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Although the Husband had sought shared care and control at the OSG proceedings, I decided then that it would be preferrable for the child to continue staying with the Wife to maintain stability in his routine and living arrangements, but at the same time increase the access for the Husband to spend more quality bonding with the child. I indicated that after the child adjusts to the changes, it would be beneficial for the child to have longer duration of access with the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     At the time of my decision in the OSG proceedings, the Husband had been exercising access to the child three times a week since my interim order dated 14 January 2021 made earlier in the same proceedings. I found that it would be in the interests of the child to commence overnight access with effect from the week beginning 3 January 2022 on the weekend from Friday 6pm to Saturday 6pm. This would provide opportunities for the child to bond with the Husband and paternal family members over a longer period of time. It would also reduce the frequency of handovers and the risk of conflict escalation in the presence of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In addition, I provided a step-up access plan for one more overnight on Saturdays starting from the week commencing 27 June 2022.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The child has adjusted well to the changes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Having regard to all the circumstances including the CER, I found that it would be beneficial for the child to transit to a shared parenting arrangement where he resides with each parent on an alternating week schedule from Friday 4pm to the following Friday 4 pm. Increasing the child’s time with the Husband would help strengthen his bond with the Husband and allow him to experience consistent and positive interactions. At the same time, the alternating week arrangement would give the Wife an equal opportunity to bond with the child over the weekend and should go some way towards assuaging her other concerns. To avoid issues of any parent returning the child late, each parent will pick the child from school on Friday 4 pm (or when formal lessons end) at the start of their alternate-week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In my brief grounds, I reminded parties once again that parental responsibility includes supporting the child’s relationships with both parents: see <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [87]).

I would encourage both parents to carry out the orders made with a supportive and cooperative spirit. In the unfortunate event that a parent is denied parenting time as a result of the unilateral decision of the other party, the affected parent shall be entitled to make-up parenting time. Parties should always endeavour to resolve any such dispute amicably before resorting to litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I made the following orders:</p> <p

child, if any, equally between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Given that parties have been able to co-operate for over two years since the OSG order was made, I was hopeful that good sense would prevail, and they would have the fortitude to bring out the best version of themselves to make the shared parenting arrangement work. I was particularly heartened, in this regard, to see a more conciliatory and enlightened approach taken by the Wife in these proceedings, compared to the hard and unreasonable stance she took in the OSG proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is therefore disappointing that after my decision was rendered, the Wife filed Notice of Appeal against the shared care arrangement and consequential orders, and applied for stay of execution. This was despite my earlier advice to parties in the OSG proceedings (see <em>WAG v WAH</em> (at [7]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is my hope that the parents would carry out the orders made with a supportive and cooperative spirit. However, both parties have filed appeals to press on with the litigation. That is of course their prerogatives as litigants, but it would also mean that the conflicts between the parents will continue to fester, and this cannot be good for the well-being of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It is worthwhile to reiterate that parental responsibility is not just a personal responsibility which involves the parents’ time and personal sacrifices, but also a legal responsibility. As Debbie Ong JAD noted in the recent decision in <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> (at [17]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements”: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<em>TAU</em>”) (at [10]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For reasons set out in separate grounds issued to parties on 24 January 2024, I dismissed the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Section 112(10) of the Charter provides the definition of “matrimonial asset”. Matrimonial assets (“MAs”) include assets which were “acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage”: s 112(10)(b) of the Charter. Assets which were acquired before the marriage are not MAs, unless transformed in accordance with the tests in s 112(10)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As a general position, the operative date for the identification of MAs is the date of the IJ, and all MAs should be valued at the date of the AM hearing. Balances in the parties’ bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the date of the IJ, as the MAs are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves: see <em>UYP v UYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23358-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 16</a> (at [4]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The pool of matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The starting point in the division exercise is the identification of the total pool of MAs: see <em>CVC v CVB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30092-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 28</a> (at [44]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The parties have filed a Joint Summary dated 25 July 2023 setting out a joint list of assets and the parties’ positions.

The Husband does not dispute that RP1 is an asset acquired before marriage but says that it should be included in the asset pool because it is a transformed asset as it was ordinarily used for the purposes of shelter for the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     It is trite law that the requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the parties’ use of or stay at the property was occasional or casual: see <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18885-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 9</a> (at [18]). This was reiterated in the recent decision of <em>CXR v CXQ</em> where Debbie Ong JAD (at [26]) noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2020 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) provides the court the ancillary power, upon a grant of divorce, to divide the matrimonial economic gains of the marriage. Assets acquired <em>during</em> marriage by either party’s <em>efforts</em> are quintessential matrimonial assets subject to division. Assets acquired before the marriage may be subject to the division exercise if they were substantially improved during the marriage by the other spouse or by both spouses, or if they were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. On the latter, such “use” must be relatively prolonged rather than casual (<em>USB v USA</em> at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Wife says that she moved back to RP1 with E in November 2019 when both she and the Husband were already facing numerous problems and the marriage had already severely broken down.

In fact, the evidence averred to by the Husband shows unequivocally that he did not reside at RP1 at all.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Accordingly, I exclude RP1 from the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">S/N2 – Riveredge Property 2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> (“RP2”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Husband says that RP2 is a pre-marriage asset under <em>USB v USA</em>. Since the flat was paid or preferably maintained during the marriage by the Wife with income that would have been or gone to a quintessential matrimonial asset had it been saved up rather than expended on the pre-marital asset, the proportion of the value of the asset that was acquired during the marriage should go into the pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Wife says that RP2 is a pre-marital asset bought in 2007.

15</a>, the Court of Appeal observed (at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Second, and with respect to items (c) to (g), the issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: <b>(a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded</b>. We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) <b>the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives.</b> The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25220-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 109</a> (“<em>UZN v UZM</em>”), the Court of Appeal elaborated further (at [65]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the label of “dissipation” is commonly used to describe dispositions intended to put assets out of reach of the other spouse, a dissipation falling within the <b><em>TNL dicta</em></b> is not necessarily a culpable act. It may also not involve a non-disclosure. Instead, this category may be seen to encompass a disposition of matrimonial assets <b>during the relevant period</b> when one spouse has failed to obtain the other’s consent, even for “innocent” reasons, as illustrated in the hypothetical example above. Adding a sum back into the pool on the basis of the <em>TNL dicta</em> does not rest on the making of an adverse inference in the way we have described at [18] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In my judgment, the sum of $200,000 should be added back to the asset pool on the basis of the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     As regards the monies in POSB Account No ~ 491-4, the Wife says that the monies belong solely to her mother.

We caveat that this does not mean parties should swing to the other extreme by being remiss in submitting the relevant records. Put simply, there ought to be <em>reasonable accounting rigour that eschews flooding the court with details that would obscure rather than illuminate</em>. Henceforth, therefore, courts should discourage parties from applying the <em>ANJ v ANK</em> approach in a rigid and calculative manner.

In <em>UZN v UZM</em>, the Court of Appeal set out at [18] (citing <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [60]) that an adverse inference may be drawn where:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a <em>prima facie</em> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    The Wife says that the Husband had access to the information he is hiding with regards to his business. There is also a substratum of evidence that the Husband has undisclosed stream of income revenue and assets in the business which he had not provided full and frank disclosure. The Husband had refused to declare the revenue generated by the business nor furnished the accounts from the business, including its Profit and Loss and business revenue. Further, the Husband has informed the Court at pre-trial conferences as well as in evidence that he is busy with numerous trials which would generate substantial revenue (all of which remains undeclared).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_95\" id=\"Ftn_95_1\"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> The Wife contends that it is clear that the Husband’s business has value while the Husband asserted it to be $0. The Wife submits that an adverse inference of 10% uplift should be drawn against the Husband to divide the known MAs in just and equitable proportions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_96\" id=\"Ftn_96_1\"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    The Husband says that he has accounted for the value of his business in the interim maintenance application FC/SUM 816/2022 (“SUM 816”) by pegging his last salary to that in the 2019 NOA, i.e., $110,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_97\" id=\"Ftn_97_1\"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> However, I do not find this to be a satisfactory response to his obligation to make full and frank disclosure of accounts relating to the business which is a matrimonial asset. The value of his business should not be conflated with the salary that he receives from the business. Without the proper accounts or a valuation report, it would not be possible to determine the value of his business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    For the above reasons, I am of the view that an adverse inference is warranted for the Husband’s failure to provide full and frank disclosure of accounts relating to his business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Giving effect to adverse inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    As noted in <em>TYS v TYT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20112-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 7</a> (“<em>TYS v TYT</em>”) (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The means by which an adverse inference may be given effect is fact-specific, including “by ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets to the other party, or, where possible, [by determining] the actual value of the undisclosed assets based on available information, and include such value in the pool of assets to be divided” (<em>Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 3 SLR 0402.xml')\">[2012] 3 SLR 402</a> at [21])</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    At [45], the court stated further as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As explained earlier, I decided to use the uplift approach to address the adverse inference because it was not practicable to come to a finite sum for the Husband’s non-disclosure. The cases adopting an uplift approach cover a broad range of facts. In <em>Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53817-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 150</a>, the High Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In <em>Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0875.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 875</a>, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% of all the remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was separately divided. While the general uplift approach may be criticised as being arbitrary since there is no objective value to which it may take reference (<em>AZZ v BAA</em> at [120]), I considered that some <b>degree of arbitrariness was inevitable as adverse inferences were drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information</b>, and discarding the uplift approach entirely may create a perverse incentive for parties to tactically craft non-attributable non-disclosure. In the final analysis, much would depend on the facts, and in determining the appropriate uplift, the court will be guided by, <em>inter alia</em>, the evidence before it as to the extent of non-disclosure relative to the value of the disclosed assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    In the present case, without proper accounts or a valuation report, it would not be practical to ascribe a finite sum to the business. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against the Husband by ordering a larger proportion of the disclosed assets to the Wife. As noted in <em>TYS v TYT</em>, some degree of arbitrariness is inevitable as adverse inferences are drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information.

In our view, the DJ, with respect, therefore erred in backdating the Final Maintenance Order on the facts of this case…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    For similar reasons, I found that it would be erroneous to backdate the maintenance order in the manner requested by the Wife as this would effectively create two different but equally binding obligations operating on the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    As regards the apportionment of maintenance, it is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments. For instance, a party who earns no income but has substantial savings or had received substantial inheritance would well be able to afford to bear a higher burden of the maintenance obligation, if reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The court should also have regard to the assets received by parties after the division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    Having considered the financial capacity of the parties, I found it fair to apportion the maintenance equally between them. Given that I have ordered a shared care and control arrangement where E is looked after by each parent on an alternate-week basis, it is unnecessary to dwell into each item of living expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    In the circumstances, I made the following orders in respect of maintenance for the child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_130-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Save as provided in sub-para (b), each party shall bear their respective costs for the child’s living expenses when he is under his or her respective care;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a

<em>ad-hoc</em> visits to the doctor throughout the year for the usual cough/cold or other minor symptoms that do not require specialised or regular medical care, the parties shall consult with each other before incurring expenses in relation to (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    This order shall take effect and supersede the interim maintenance order from January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    There shall be no spousal maintenance for the Wife and the Husband.</p> <p
